item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts overview the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
our hotel tenants and managers 
our hotel operating agreements contain security features  such as guarantees and security deposits  which are intended to protect minimum returns and rents due to us in accordance with our operating agreements regardless of hotel performance 
however  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted receipt by us of minimum returns and rents is not assured  particularly if the us economy and the lodging industry takes an extended period to recover from the severe declines experienced during the recent recession 
if our tenants  managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline and we may be unable to pay distributions to our shareholders 
during the twelve months ended december   all payments due to us under our hotel leases and hotel management contracts were paid when due except for certain payments from marriott and intercontinental 
marriott agreement 
on june   we entered an agreement to re align three of our contracts with marriott 
additional details of this agreement are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference 
after giving effect to the january  effective date of the new agreement with marriott  the payments we received were  less than the minimum amounts contractually due during the twelve months ended december  we applied the remaining  of available security deposit to partially cover these shortfalls and marriott provided  of guaranty payments to us 
intercontinental agreement 
on july   we entered an agreement to re align all four of our contracts with intercontinental 
additional details of this agreement are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference 
during the twelve months ended december   the payments we received under our agreements with intercontinental were  less than the minimum amounts contractually required 
we applied the available security deposit to cover these shortfalls 
other hotel management agreement and lease matters 
as of february   all other payments due to us from our hotel managers and hotel tenants under our operating agreements were current 
additional details of our guarantees from hyatt and carlson are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference 
when we reduce the amounts of the security deposits we hold under our operating agreements for payment deficiencies  we record income equal to the amounts by which these deposits are reduced up to the minimum return or minimum rent due to us 
however  reducing the security deposits does not result in additional cash flow to us of the deficiency amounts  but reducing amounts of security deposits does reduce the refunds due to the respective lessees or managers who have provided us with these deposits upon expiration of the respective lease or management agreement 
security deposits are non interest bearing and are not required to be held in escrow 
under all of our hotel operating agreements that include security deposits  any amounts of the security deposits which are applied to payment deficits may be replenished from future cash flows under the respective agreements 
when we receive 
table of contents payments under guarantees under our leases or operating agreements  we receive cash 
when we receive guaranty payments under our hotel operating agreements  generally the hotel operator is allowed to recapture payments it makes to us out of some or all of the hotels future cash flows after our minimum returns are paid 
in november  host notified us that it will not exercise its renewal option at the end of the current lease term for hotels which we have historically referred to as our marriott no 
contract 
in the absence of any default by host  upon expiration of the agreement on december   we expect to return the  security deposit to host  to lease these hotels to one of our trss and to continue the existing hotel brand and management agreements with marriott with respect to these hotels 
in june  marriott notified us that it intends to exercise its option to renew these management agreements for an additional years to ta amendment agreement 
on january   we entered into an amendment agreement with ta which modified the terms of our two leases with ta pursuant to which we lease of our travel centers to  and which are operated by  subsidiaries of ta 
additional details of this agreement are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference 
as of february   all payments due to us under our ta leases were current 
royal sonesta acquisition 
on january   we completed our previously announced acquisition of the entities which own the royal sonesta hotel in cambridge  ma rooms and lease the royal sonesta hotel in new orleans  la rooms for  excluding acquisition costs 
additional details of this transaction are set forth in notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference

the increase in hotel operating expenses was primarily caused by the conversion of hotels from leased to managed as described above  and increased expenses associated with higher occupancy at our managed hotels  partially offset by the funding by certain of our managers of minimum return deficiencies and our application of security deposits to cover minimum return deficiencies

we recorded a  or per share  loss on asset impairment in the twelve months ended december  to further reduce the carrying value of certain of these hotels 
the increase in operating income is primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above  particularly the loss on asset impairment recorded in the decrease in interest income is due to lower average cash balances during versus

additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page the increase in minimum rents hotels was a result of our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and that resulted in increases in the annual minimum rents due to us 
the increase in rental income travel centers was a result of contractual rent increases in our lease agreement with ta for travel centers and interest of  earned on deferred rent amounts in pursuant to our rent deferral agreement with ta discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
rental income for both periods excludes  of rent deferred by ta under the rent deferral agreement

we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels as ff e reserve income 
the increase in hotel operating expenses was primarily caused by increased expenses associated with higher occupancy at our managed hotels  partially offset by the funding by certain of our managers of minimum return deficiencies and our application of a security deposit to cover minimum return deficiencies 
certain of our managed hotel portfolios had net operating results that were  in the aggregate   and  less than the minimum returns due to us in and  respectively 
these shortfalls were funded by the managers of these hotels under the terms of our operating agreements and we reflected these fundings including security deposit applications in our consolidated statements of income as a reduction to hotel operating expenses

the decrease in income tax expense is primarily the result of lower state income taxes due to a decrease in taxable income for state income tax purposes as a result of our increased common share distributions in compared to 
table of contents the decreases in net income  net income available for common shareholders and net income available for common shareholders per common share in are primarily a result of the changes discussed above  particularly the loss on asset impairment recorded in liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts our managers and tenants as of december   all of our properties are operated under eight management agreements or leases 
all costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by our hotel managers as agents for us or by our tenants for their own account 
these hotel managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses  ff e reserves  and returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and  to the extent that these parties themselves fund our minimum returns and minimum rents  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our hotel management agreements or leases as total property sales minus all property level expenses that are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the minimum return or minimum rent payments due to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our operating agreements is presented in the tables on pages and during the twelve months ended december   all six of our hotel operating agreements  generated coverage of less than x x to x 
we define coverage for our travel center leases as property level sales minus all property level expenses divided by the minimum rent payments due to us 
during the twelve months ended september   our two travel center leases  representing properties  generated coverage of x and x  respectively 
because substantially all of ta s business is conducted at properties leased from us  property level rent coverage may not be an appropriate way to evaluate ta s ability to pay rents due to us 
we believe property level rent coverage is nonetheless one useful indicator of the performance and value of our properties as we believe it is what an operator interested in acquiring these properties or leaseholds might use to evaluate these properties contributions to their earnings before corporate level expenses 
two hundred ninety of our properties  representing of our total historical investments at cost as of december   are operated under six management arrangements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the property level cash flows fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us 
some of our managers and tenants  or their affiliates  may also supplement cash flow from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees 
guaranty or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases do not subject us to repayment obligations  but  under some of our agreements  the manager or tenant may recover these guaranty or supplemental payments from the future cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid 
as described above  certain of our agreements are generating cash flows that are less than the minimum amounts contractually required and we have been utilizing the security features and guarantees in our agreements to cover these shortfalls 
however  several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts and are for limited durations and may be exhausted or expire  especially if our properties operations and our managers and tenants do not sufficiently recover from the recent recession in a reasonable time period 
accordingly  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured 
if any of our hotel managers  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 

table of contents our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive additional returns  percentage rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions  if any  either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  debt service interest and distributions to shareholders declared by our board of trustees 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments declared by our board of trustees for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter 
however  because of the impact of the weak us economy on the hotel and travel center industries  our managers and tenants may be unable to pay minimum returns and minimum rents to us when due  in which case our cash flow and net income will decline and we may need to reduce the amount of  or even eliminate  our distributions to common shareholders 
changes in our cash flows in the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in were as follows cash flow provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in  cash used in investing activities decreased from  in to  in  and cash used in financing activities decreased from  in to  in the increase in cash provided by operating activities between and is due primarily to the increase in rental income we received pursuant to our amended ta leases and increases in our minimum returns and rents under certain of our hotel operating agreements 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the supplemental security deposit we received from intercontinental in pursuant to the agreement to realign our operating agreements as described above compared to a  refund of a security deposit for an expired lease in  partially offset by an increase in the funding of improvements to certain of our hotels and travel centers in the decrease in cash used in financing activities between and is primarily a result of reduced net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in and our repurchase of  of our convertible senior notes in compared to no repurchases in we maintain our status as a reit under the irc by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
the irc  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to trss if the hotels are managed by a third party 
the income realized by our trss in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to us federal income tax at corporate tax rates 
the income we receive from our hotels in canada and puerto rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where we have properties 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at certain of our hotels are escrowed by us as ff e reserves to fund future capital improvements 
during the twelve months ended december   our hotel managers and hotel tenants contributed  to these accounts and  was spent from the ff e reserve escrow accounts and from separate payments by us to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
as of december   there was  on deposit in these escrow accounts  which was held directly by us and is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash 
our hotel operating agreements generally provide that  if necessary  we may provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed ff e reserves 
to the extent we make such additional fundings  our annual minimum returns or minimum rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund 
during 
table of contents the twelve months ended december   we funded  for capital improvements in excess of ff e reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels  as follows during the twelve months ended december   we funded  for improvements to hotels included in our marriott no 
contract using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently do not expect to make fundings for capital improvements materially in excess of amounts available in escrowed ff e reserves under this agreement in pursuant to the june agreement we entered with marriott for management of hotels  we agreed to provide approximately  of funding during the next two years for renovations of certain of these hotels and for other improvements 
as we fund improvements pursuant to this agreement  the minimum returns payable to us increase 
we funded  of this commitment during the twelve months ended december  using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to fund approximately  of this commitment during using our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
also pursuant to this agreement  hotels included in the agreement were identified for sale  however  subsequent to december   we entered discussions with marriott about retaining certain of these hotels in the agreement 
if we retain certain of these hotels in the agreement  we will be required to fund previously agreed amounts for renovations to the retained hotels which are in addition to the fundings described above 
pursuant to the july agreement we entered with intercontinental for management of hotels  we have committed to a renovation program for all of the hotels included in the new agreement pursuant to which we expect to invest approximately  over the next two years 
pursuant to the agreement  we may rebrand or sell up to hotels included in the agreement 
the final amount we are required to fund for renovations will be adjusted based on the number of hotels which we determine to rebrand or sell and remove from the agreement  however  if we determine to rebrand certain properties  we expect to be required to fund amounts for rebranding costs and renovations to the rebranded hotels 
as we fund improvements pursuant to this agreement  the minimum returns payable to us increase 
we funded  of this commitment during the twelve months ended december  using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to fund approximately  of this commitment during using our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in november  host notified us that it will not exercise its renewal option at the end of the current lease term for courtyard hotels which we have historically referred to as our marriott no 
contract 
assuming that host does not default in its contractual obligations to us  upon expiration of this agreement on december   we expect to return the  security deposit to host 
we expect to fund the return of this security deposit using existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our travel center leases with ta do not require ff e escrow deposits 
however  ta is required to maintain the leased travel centers  including structural and non structural components 
under both our leases with ta  ta may request that we fund additional amounts for capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for minimum rent increases 
we funded  for capital improvements to ta under this lease provision during the twelve months ended december  using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we currently expect to fund approximately  for capital improvements to our travel center properties during  using funds from our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
however  ta is not obligated to request and we are not obligated to fund any such improvements 

table of contents on january   april   july  and october   we paid a per share distribution to our series b preferred shareholders with respect to the periods ending january   april   july  and october   respectively

on january   we repaid without penalty our mortgage note payable  which had a principal balance of  using existing cash balances 
in july  we sold our holiday inn branded hotel in memphis  tennessee  for net proceeds of  we used the net proceeds to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
in january  we sold  series d cumulative redeemable preferred shares  or our series d preferred shares  at a price of per share in a public offering 
the distribution rate on the preferred shares is of the liquidation preference per year  or per share per year 
net proceeds from this sale of  after underwriting and other offering expenses were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and to fund acquisitions 
on january   we acquired the entities which own the royal sonesta hotel boston in cambridge  massachusetts and lease the royal sonesta hotel new orleans in new orleans  louisana for  excluding acquisition costs 
the purchase price was funded with proceeds from the offering of our series d preferred shares described above 
on february   we entered an agreement to sell our marriott branded hotel in st 
louis  missouri with rooms 
the contract sales price is  excluding closing costs 
we expect to complete this sale in the second quarter of this pending transaction is subject to buyer s completion of due diligence and other customary closing conditions  accordingly  we can provide no assurances that we will sell this hotel 
on february   we redeemed all of our  outstanding of series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares at the stated liquidation preference price of per share plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of redemption 
we funded this redemption using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in order to fund capital improvements to our properties and acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of returns and rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders 
on september   we entered a new  unsecured revolving credit facility 
the new facility replaced our previous  unsecured revolving credit facility  which 
table of contents had a maturity date of october  the maturity date of the new facility is september  and  subject to the payment of an extension fee and meeting certain other conditions  includes an option for us to extend the facility for one year to september  interest paid under the new facility is set at libor plus basis points  subject to adjustments based on our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the annual interest rate payable on our borrowings under the facility was as of december  we may draw  repay and redraw funds until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
as of december  and february   we had  and  respectively  outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in   in   in   in   in  and  in our  of convertible senior notes due are convertible into our common shares  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their maturity dates 
at december   we had  of cash excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents and  available to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  the cash flow from our operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future debt maturities and property acquisitions and for other general business purposes 
when significant amounts are outstanding for an extended period of time under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach  we currently expect we would explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but it does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
while we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity  to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will be reasonable 

table of contents as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations ground lease obligations security deposits capital improvements projected interest expense purchase obligations total holders of our convertible senior notes  due in may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  the amounts in the table reflect these notes in the less than year category as we expect to be required by their holders to repurchase them on march  of our hotels and of our travel centers are on land leased partially or in its entirety 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payments of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center

debt covenants our debt obligations at december   consist of our revolving credit facility and  of unsecured term debt and convertible notes 
our unsecured term debt and convertible notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain various financial ratios 
as of december   we believe 
table of contents we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our revolving credit facility agreement contains provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit facility agreement  our highest senior unsecured debt rating is used to determine the fees and interest rate we pay 
accordingly  if that debt rating is downgraded by certain credit rating agencies  our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility would increase 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions to any other debts of  or more 
similarly  our revolving credit facility agreement has cross default provisions to other indebtedness that is recourse of  or more and indebtedness that is non recourse of  or more

we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property 
these policies affect our classification of leases and the related impact on the recognition of rental income  allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate and intangible assets  
table of contents variable interest entities  and income taxes 
certain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
we allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land  buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their fair values and each component generally has a different useful life 
for real estate acquired  we record building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of acquired in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value 
we allocate the excess  if any  of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill 
we base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and  under some circumstances  studies from independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives 
we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
we amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives  or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract 
we do not depreciate the allocated cost of land 
purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates 
incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods 
we periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
an impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value 
we determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques 
these analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate  fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
we have determined that each of our trss is a variable interest entity  or vie  as defined under the consolidation topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification tm  or the codification 
we have concluded that we must consolidate each of our trss 
table of contents because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such vies performance and we have the obligation to absorb the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of each vie  with the primary focus on losses  and are therefore the primary beneficiary of each vie 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the codification 
under this topic  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the irc and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements 
despite our reit status  we are subject to income tax in canada  puerto rico and in certain states 
further  we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned trss that  unlike most of our subsidiaries  are generally subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the trss and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our tax status as a reit 
the income taxes topic also prescribes how we should recognize  measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit 
to the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied  the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
tax returns filed for the through tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future  we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property management agreements  leases and operating statistics as of december   we owned hotels and travel centers that are grouped into eight operating agreements 
as of december   our hotels are managed by or leased to subsidiaries of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host  hyatt and carlson under six agreements

table of contents seasonality our hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
so long as guarantees and security deposits are available to supplement earnings shortfalls at our properties  this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flow because our contractual management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return payments and rents to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
if and as guarantees and security deposits which secure the minimum rents and returns due to us are exhausted our financial results may begin to reflect the seasonality of the industries in which our tenants and managers operate 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our managers or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents and the security features  such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents are exhausted 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future  the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur  the requirements of our borrowing arrangements and the cost of such hedge arrangements 
impact of climate change the ongoing political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our hotel and travel center properties to increase 
we do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations  because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or managers directly or in the longer term  passed through and paid by customers of our properties 
although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future  laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or managers and their ability to pay rent or returns to us 
non gaap measures we provide below calculations of our funds from operations  or ffo  and normalized ffo for the twelve months ended december   and we believe that this data may facilitate an understanding of our consolidated historical operating results 
these measures should be considered in conjunction with net income and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of cash flow 
these measures do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  net income available to common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity  
table of contents nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
other reits and real estate companies may calculate ffo and normalized ffo differently than we do 
funds from operations and normalized funds from operations we calculate ffo and normalized ffo as shown below 
ffo is calculated on the basis defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  which is net income  calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding gain or loss on sale of properties  plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment of assets 
our calculation of normalized ffo differs from nareit s definition of ffo because we include percentage rent in the period it is received rather than when it is recognized as income in accordance with gaap and exclude gain loss on early extinguishment of debt and acquisition related costs 
we consider ffo and normalized ffo to be appropriate measures of performance for a reit  along with net income and cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities 
we believe that ffo and normalized ffo provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts  such as depreciation expense  ffo and normalized ffo can facilitate a comparison of operating performances between periods 
ffo and normalized ffo are among the factors considered by our board of trustees when determining the amount of distributions to our shareholders 
other factors include  but are not limited to  requirements to maintain our status as a reit  limitations in our revolving credit facility and public debt covenants  the availability of debt and equity capital to us and our expectation of our future capital requirements and operating performance 
our calculations of ffo and normalized ffo for the twelve months ended december   and  and reconciliations of ffo and normalized ffo to net income available for common shareholders  the most directly comparable financial measure under gaap reported in our consolidated financial statements  appear in the following table 
year ended december  net income loss available for common shareholders depreciation and amortization loss on asset impairment ffo acquisition related costs loss gain on extinguishment of debt normalized ffo weighted average shares outstanding net income loss available for common shareholders per share ffo per share normalized ffo per share distributions declared per share 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
as of december   our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of seven issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes and one issue of fixed rate  convertible senior notes principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually the convertible senior notes are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  except as described in note to the table above  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of these debts will not affect our operating results 
however  if at maturity these notes were refinanced at interest rates which are higher than the rates shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and assuming discounted cash flow analyses and other credit market conditions remain unchanged  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately  changes in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our convertible senior notes 
each of these fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a premium equal to a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the note holder 
also  as noted herein  we have recently repurchased and retired some of our outstanding debts and we may do so again in the future 
these prepayment rights and our ability to repurchase and retire outstanding debt may afford us opportunities to mitigate the risks of refinancing our debts at their maturities at higher rates by refinancing prior to the contractual maturities 

table of contents our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates 
at december   we had  outstanding and  available to draw under our revolving credit facility 
we may make repayments under this agreement at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under these agreements are subject to interest at libor plus a spread as of december  
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar short term interest rates  specifically libor 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
for example  the interest rate payable on our outstanding indebtedness of  under our revolving credit facility was per annum at december  the following table presents the impact a change in interest rates would have on our weighted average floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  increase reduction the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt  if any
