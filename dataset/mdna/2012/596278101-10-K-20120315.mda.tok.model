critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
at the commercial foodservice group  the company recognizes revenue on the sale of its products when risk of loss has passed to the customer  which occurs at the time of shipment  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the sale prices of the products sold are fixed and determinable at the time of shipment 
sales are reported net of sales returns  sales incentives and cash discounts based on prior experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
at the food processing equipment group  the company enters into long term sales contracts for certain products that are often significant relative to the business 
revenue under these long term sales contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method defined within asc construction type and production type contracts due to the length of time to fully manufacture and assemble the equipment 
the company measures revenue recognized based on the ratio of actual labor hours incurred in relation to the total estimated labor hours to be incurred related to the contract 
because estimated labor hours to complete a project are based upon forecasts using the best available information  the actual hours may differ from original estimates 
the percentage of completion method of accounting for these contracts most accurately reflects the status of these uncompleted contracts in the company s financial statements and most accurately measures the matching of revenues with expenses 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue for sales of products and services not covered by long term sales contracts are recognized risk of loss has passed to the customer  which occurs at the time of shipment  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the sale prices of the products sold are fixed and determinable at the time of shipment 
sales are reported net of sales returns  sales incentives and cash discounts based on prior experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or or market using the first in  first out method for the majority of the company s inventories 
the company evaluates the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
the company s policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the company s business acquisitions result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which are a significant portion of the company s total assets 
the company recognizes goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill and include trademarks and trade names  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
trademarks and trade names are deemed to be indefinite lived 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to impairment testing 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if triggering events occur  the company compares the estimated fair value to the carrying value to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss  if any  is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of goodwill 
in estimating the fair value of specific intangible assets  management relies on a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable transactions and other market data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes 
the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
the company s deferred and other tax balances are based on management s interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions 
income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income  the effect of the company s various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions 
future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 
the company follows the provisions under asc that provides a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition of a tax benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the benefits will be sustained on examination 
tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
whether the more likely than not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date

also  the asu provides additional examples of events and circumstances that an entity having a reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount should consider in determining whether to measure an impairment loss  if any  under the second step of the goodwill impairment test
