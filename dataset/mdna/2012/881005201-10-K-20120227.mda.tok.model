item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
if the service contests the federal income tax positions we take  the market for our units may be adversely impacted and the cost of any service contest will reduce available cash 
we have not requested a ruling from the service with respect to tnclp s treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter 
the service may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of our positions 
any contest with the service may materially and adversely impact the market for our units 
table of contents terra nitrogen company  lp and the price at which they trade 
in addition  the costs of any contest with the service will be borne indirectly by our unitholders because the costs would reduce our available cash 
the tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative  judicial or administrative changes and differing interpretations  possibly on a retroactive basis 
the present us federal income tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships  including us  or an investment in our units  may be modified by administrative  legislative or judicial interpretation at any time 
recently  members of the us congress considered substantive changes to the existing us federal income tax laws that would have affected the tax treatment of certain publicly traded partnerships 
any modification to the us federal income tax laws or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
although we are unable to predict whether any of these changes or any other proposals will ultimately be enacted  any changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our units 
our unitholders will be required to pay taxes on their share of tnclp income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
a unitholder is required to pay us federal income tax and  in certain cases  state and local income taxes on its allocable share of tnclp s income  whether or not such unitholder receives cash distributions from us 
no assurance is given that our unitholders will receive cash distributions equal to their allocable share of taxable income from us 
further  a unitholder may incur tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received  particularly upon the sale or other disposition of its units 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
we prorate our items of income and loss between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units as of the close of business on the last day of the preceding month instead of the date a particular unit is transferred 
as a result of this monthly allocation  a unitholder transferring units may be allocated income  gain  loss  deduction and credit recognized after the transfer 
the use of these proration methods may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations promulgated under the code treasury regulations 
if the service was to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
tax gain or loss on disposition of our units could be more or less than expected 
if a unitholder sells its units  for income tax purposes  the unitholder will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and that unitholder s adjusted tax basis in those units 
because distributions in excess of a unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income decrease that unitholder s tax basis in its units  the amount  if any  of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units sold will  in effect  become taxable income allocated to that unitholder if the unitholder sells such units at a price greater than that unitholder s tax basis in those units  even if the price received is less than the original cost 
furthermore  a portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be taxed as ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized may include a unitholder s share of our nonrecourse liabilities  if a unitholder sells its units  such unitholder may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash received from the sale 

table of contents terra nitrogen company  lp tax exempt entities and non us persons face unique tax issues from owning our units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in our common units by tax exempt entities  including employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts known as iras  and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  substantially all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from us federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and may be taxable to such unitholders 
distributions to non us persons will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons will be required to file non us federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
any tax exempt entity or non us person should consult its tax advisor before investing in our units 
we treat each purchaser of our units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual units purchased 
the service may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of our units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of our units and to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our common units  we have adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
a successful service challenge to these positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to a unitholder or the value of our common units 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in a termination of tnclp for federal income tax purposes 
tnclp and the operating partnership will be considered to have constructively terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in tnclp capital and profits within a month period 
for purposes of determining whether the threshold has been met  multiple sales of the same interest are counted only once 
because cf industries currently owns approximately of the outstanding common units of tnclp  a sale or exchange of all or a substantial portion of cf industries interests in tnclp  when combined with trading in the open market  may constitute a sale or exchange of or more of the total interest in tnclp 
a constructive termination would  among other things  result in the closing of the tnclp s taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a calendar year  the closing of a tax year of tnclp may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being included in such unitholder s taxable income for the year of termination 
termination could also subject us to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred and therefore failed to make necessary elections in a timely manner 
a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  the unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  the unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan  and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units 
table of contents terra nitrogen company  lp could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners should modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units 
as a result of investing in our units  a unitholder may become subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where we operate or own or acquire property 
in addition to federal income taxes  our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future  even if our unitholders do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
our unitholders will likely be required to file state income tax returns and pay state income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with such requirements
