item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview we are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have three operating segments i triumph aerostructures group  whose companies revenues are derived from the design  manufacture  assembly and integration of metallic and composite aerostructures and structural components for the global aerospace original equipment manufacturers  or oem  market  ii triumph aerospace systems group  whose companies design  engineer and manufacture a wide range of proprietary and build to print components  assemblies and systems also for the oem market  and iii triumph aftermarket services group  whose companies serve aircraft fleets  notably commercial airlines  the us military and cargo carriers  through the maintenance  repair and overhaul of aircraft components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
on june   we acquired vought aircraft industries  inc vought from the carlyle group 
the acquisition of vought establishes the company as a leading global manufacturer of aerostructures for commercial  military and business jet aircraft 
products include fuselages  wings  empennages  nacelles and helicopter cabins 
strategically  the acquisition of vought substantially increased our design capabilities and provided further diversification across customers and programs  as well as exposure to new growth platforms 
the acquired business is operating as triumph aerostructures vought commercial division and triumph aerostructures vought integrated programs division 
the company s consolidated financial statements include vought s results of operations and cash flows from june  financial highlights for the fiscal year ended march  include net sales for fiscal increased to billion  including a increase due to organic growth 
operating income in fiscal increased to million  which included a million increase due to a net curtailment gain resulting from amendments to defined benefit plans  partially offset by million of acquisition and integration expenses associated with the fiscal year acquisition of vought 
net income for fiscal increased to million 
backlog increased over the prior year to billion 
for the fiscal year ended march   net sales totaled billion  a increase from fiscal year net sales of billion 
net income for fiscal year increased to million  or per diluted common share  versus million  or per diluted common share  for fiscal year as discussed in further detail below under results of operations  the increase in net income is attributable to contribution from the acquisition of vought for the full year  a million curtailment gain  net of special termination benefits resulting from amendments to certain defined benefit pension plans  and organic growth 
also  the prior year included the acquisition and integration expenses and additional interest expense associated with the financing of the acquisition of vought 
our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated million of cash flows from operating activities  used million in investing activities and used million from financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities in fiscal year included million in pension contributions 
we continue to remain focused on growing our core businesses as well as growing through strategic acquisitions 
our organic sales increased in fiscal due to continuing improvement to the overall economy  increased build rates by boeing and airbus  increased passenger and freight traffic from previously depressed levels and less airline inventory de stocking 
our company has an aggressive but selective acquisition approach that adds capabilities and increases our capacity for strong and consistent internal growth 
the budget act  which became law in august  has two primary parts 
the first mandates a billion reduction to previously planned defense spending over the next decade 
the second part is a sequester mechanism that would impose an additional billion of cuts on defense funding between the government s fiscal year ending september and fiscal year if congress does not identify a means to reduce the us deficit by trillion 
as of may   congress has not identified these required savings 
if congress does not identify the required reduction  defense spending would likely sustain further cuts 
for fiscal year  the president has requested total defense funding of billion  including billion for investment accounts 
in accordance with the first part of the budget act  the dod s five year spending plan submitted with the fiscal year funding request incorporates billion of cuts when compared with the previous five year plan 
however  the spending plan does not include the impact of sequestration  the second part of the budget act 
due to the planned reductions in defense spending under the budget act  we expect the declining trend in the military end market to 
table of contents continue 
in fiscal  our wholly owned subsidiary  triumph interiors  llc  acquired the assets of aviation network services  llc ans  a leading provider of repair and refurbishment of aircraft interiors primarily for commercial airlines 
ans provides triumph interiors  llc with additional capacity and expanded product offerings  such as the repair and refurbishment of passenger service units and other interior products 
the results of triumph interiors  llc continue to be included in the company s aftermarket services segment 
this acquisition did not have a material impact on the fiscal results of operations 
in fiscal  we began efforts to establish a new facility in red oak  texas to expand our capacity  particularly under the bombardier global program 
as of march   we have incurred approximately million in capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we began efforts to establish a new manufacturing facility in zacatecas  mexico to complement our existing manufacturing sites 
our expansion is expected to allow us to better manage our production costs in a competitive global market and to effectively increase capacity at our existing domestic plants and involve a significant number of our operating companies and a wide range of capabilities and technologies 
as of march   we have incurred approximately million in capital expenditures in zacatecas 
results of operations the following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations 
the company s diverse structure and customer base do not provide for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results 
however  we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission the sec guidance on compliance and disclosure interpretations  we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases 
currently  the non gaap financial measure that we disclose is ebitda  which is our income from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  amortization of acquired contract liabilities  curtailment gains losses  depreciation and amortization  and adjusted ebitda  which is ebitda adjusted for acquisition related costs associated with the acquisition of vought 
we disclose ebitda and adjusted ebitda on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the sec 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we view ebitda as an operating performance measure and  as such  we believe that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is income from continuing operations 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude from income from continuing operations the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss  income from continuing operations  or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss or income from continuing operations 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of ebitda to income from continuing operations set forth below  in our earnings releases and in other filings with the sec and to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the sec  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda 
ebitda is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years expanding our product and service capabilities partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our operations  which included acquisitions  our income from continuing operations has included significant charges for depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for depreciation and amortization 
we believe the disclosure of ebitda helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe ebitda is a measure of our ongoing operating 
table of contents performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization  and non operating items  such as interest and income taxes  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our income from continuing operations to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to income from continuing operations curtailment gains losses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the current period impact of the change in the defined benefit obligation due to the reduction in future service costs 
we do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations 
amortization of acquired contract liabilities may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the non cash earnings on the fair value of off market contracts acquired through the acquisition of vought 
we do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations 
amortization expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights and licenses 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of interest expense and other we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business

the prior year period was negatively impacted by challenges such as the decreased demand for business jets and regional jets as well as commercial rate reductions particularly in the program 

table of contents cost of sales increased by million  or  to billion for the fiscal year ended march  from billion for the fiscal year ended march  this increase resulted from the acquisitions noted above  which contributed an additional million 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  was compared with for the fiscal year ended march  the improvement in gross margin was due to synergies related to the acquisition of vought  lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and favorable cumulative catch up adjustments on long term contracts discussed further below 
segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the operating income increase was due to the contribution from the acquisitions million and increased organic sales million 
the contribution of vought included favorable cumulative catch up adjustments to operating income million and lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses million 
segment operating income also improved due to decreases in overall head count resulting in lower compensation and benefits primarily as a result of the continued integration of vought million 
the favorable cumulative catch up adjustments to operating income included gross favorable adjustments of million and gross unfavorable adjustments of million 
the cumulative catch up adjustments were due to lower overall overhead cost assumptions  revisions in our mix of various material and labor costs related to our efforts to gain efficiencies through expansion of our in sourcing capabilities and the reduction in provisions for technical problems on production lots at or near completion  net of erp system implementation expenses 
corporate expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  corporate expenses decreased primarily due to million in curtailment gain  net of special termination benefits associated with amendments made to certain defined benefit plans

interest expense and other decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding during the fiscal year ended march  due to the extinguishment of the term loan credit agreement the term loan in april  along with lower interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
interest expense and other includes the write off of million of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees associated with the extinguishment of the term loan  offset by a million favorable fair value adjustment due to the reduction of the fair value of a contingent earnout liability associated with a prior acquisition due to changes in the projected earnings over the respective earnout periods 
the company also considered these changes in projected earnings to be an indicator of impairment of the long lived assets directly related to this acquisition and  as a result  tested these long lived assets for recoverability and concluded that the assets were recoverable 
the fiscal year ended march  also included an additional million for amortization of discount on the convertible notes  as defined below 
the discount on the convertible notes was fully amortized as of september  the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  the income tax provision for the fiscal year ended march  included million of tax expense due to the recapture of domestic production deductions taken in prior carryback periods  offset by a million net tax benefit related to provision to return adjustments upon filing our fiscal tax return 
the effective income tax rate was impacted by the expiration of the research and development tax credit as of december  and the absence of the domestic production deduction due to the company s net operating loss position for the fiscal year ended march  the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was impacted by the million in acquisition and integration expenses  which were only partially deductible for tax purposes  offset by the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit back to january  in july  the company completed the sale of triumph precision castings co

business segment performance we report our financial performance based on the following three reportable segments the aerostructures group  the aerospace systems group and the aftermarket services group 
the company s chief operating decision maker codm utilizes ebitda as a primary measure of profitability to evaluate performance of its segments and allocate resources 
the results of operations among our reportable segments vary due to differences in competitors  customers  extent of proprietary deliverables and performance 
for example  our aerostructures segment generally includes long term sole source or preferred supplier contracts and the success of these programs provides a strong foundation for our business and positions us well for future growth on new programs and new derivatives 
this compares to our aerospace systems segment which generally includes proprietary products and or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers  where our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin 
also  oems are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties  and as a result  are less of a competitive force than in previous years 
in contrast  our aftermarket services segment provides mro services on components and accessories manufactured by third parties  with more diverse competition  including airlines  oems and other third party service providers 
in addition  variability in the timing and extent of customer requests performed in the aftermarket services segment can provide for greater volatility and less predictability in revenue and earnings than that experienced in the aerostructures and aerospace systems segments 
the aerostructures segment consists of the company s operations that manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the aerostructures segment s revenues are derived from the design  manufacture  assembly and integration of metallic and composite aerostructures and structural components  including aircraft wings  fuselage sections  tail assemblies  engine nacelles  flight control surfaces as well as helicopter cabins 
further  the segment s operations also design and manufacture composite assemblies for floor panels and environmental control system ducts 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aerospace systems segment consists of the company s operations that also manufacture products primarily for the aerospace oem market 
the segment s operations design and engineer mechanical and electromechanical controls  such as hydraulic systems  main engine gearbox assemblies  accumulators  mechanical control cables and non structural cockpit components 
these products are sold to various aerospace oems on a global basis 
the aftermarket services segment consists of the company s operations that provide maintenance  repair and overhaul services to both commercial and military markets on components and accessories manufactured by third parties 
maintenance  repair and overhaul revenues are derived from services on auxiliary power units  airframe and engine accessories  including constant speed drives  cabin compressors  starters and generators  and pneumatic drive units 
in addition  the segment s operations repair and overhaul thrust reversers  nacelle components and flight control surfaces 
the segment s operations also perform repair and overhaul services and supply spare parts for various types of cockpit instruments and gauges for a broad range of commercial airlines on a worldwide basis 
we currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry  the military  the business jet industry and the regional airline industry 
our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries 
if any of these industries experiences a downturn  our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us 
the following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment 
the loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business

we continue to experience an increase in the mix of the commercial aerospace end market 
we recently have experienced slight growth in the business jet end market  offset by a slight decrease in our military end market 
due to the planned reductions in defense spending under the budget act  we expect the declining trend in the military end market to continue 
the shift in our sales mix from fiscal to fiscal across segments was due to the acquisition of vought  however  the acquisition of vought had little impact on the change in the sales by end market on a consolidated basis

the prior year period was negatively impacted by the decreased demand for business jets and regional jets as well as commercial rate reductions particularly in the program 
aerostructures segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased due to the increase in organic sales million and contribution from the acquisition of vought million 
the contribution of vought included cumulative catch up adjustments to operating income with gross favorable adjustments of million and gross unfavorable adjustments of million  as well as lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses of million 
the contribution of vought also included improvements due to decreases in overall head count resulting in lower compensation and benefits primarily as a result of the continued integration million 
these same factors contributed to the increase in ebitda year over year 
aerostructures segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to the net favorable cumulative catch up adjustments and lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses discussed above  which also caused the improvements in ebitda margin 
aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  net sales increased due to continued improvements in the broader market and benefits from large outsourcing programs 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to increases in gross margin million due to sales mix and increased efficiencies in production associated with higher volume of work and increased sales million  offset by increased legal fees million due in part to the inclusion in the prior year of the net recovery of million of prior legal costs and increased development costs million 
these same factors contributed to the increase in ebitda year over year 
aerospace systems segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to improvements in gross margin as noted above  which also caused the improvements in ebitda margin 

table of contents aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the acquisition of ans contributed million of increased net sales 
organic net sales increased due to continued improvement in global commercial air traffic and decreases in airline inventory de stocking 
aftermarket services segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to contribution from the acquisition of ans million and increased efficiencies in production associated with higher volume of work million 
also  the period was favorably impacted by decreased depreciation and amortization expense million as certain intangible assets became fully depreciated during fiscal  offset by million in increased bad debt reserves associated with the bankruptcies of american airlines  pinnacle and aveos 
these same factors contributed to the increase in ebitda year over year  however  the growth in ebitda was less than the growth in operating income  as depreciation and amortization was lower in fiscal year versus fiscal year aftermarket services segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to the increase in sales volume and related efficiencies noted above

excluding the elimination of intercompany sales to vought for the year ended march   organic sales increased million  or  as compared to the prior year  when the respective sales were not eliminated 
the prior year period was negatively impacted by reductions in the business jet and regional jet markets due to the overall economic conditions and by major program delays particularly in the and programs 
the fiscal year ended march  continued to be negatively impacted by the decreased demand for business jets and regional jets as well as commercial rate reductions particularly in the program 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the acquisition of vought occurred in the prior year period  the current year was also negatively impacted by rate reductions to the c program and decreased non recurring sales associated with the transition to the program 
aerostructures segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to contribution from the acquisition of vought million  as well as improvements in organic gross margin  partially offset by increases in legal expenses million 
these same factors contributed to the increase in ebitda year over year 
the increase of ebitda was greater than the increase in operating income  due to the increase in depreciation and amortization  which is not included in ebitda 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due principally to the vought acquisition 
aerostructures segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to lower margins from vought  which also caused the decline in ebitda margin 
aerospace systems the aerospace systems segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the acquisition of fabritech contributed million of increased net sales 
organic sales increased by million due to improvements in the broader market and benefits from large outsourcing programs 
the prior year period sales were negatively impacted by the boeing strike 
aerospace systems segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to margins attained on increased sales million  including the contribution from the fabritech acquisition million  as well as decreases in legal fees million  partially offset by decreases in organic gross margin million due in part to increased warranty reserves and increases in bad debt expense million 
these same factors contributed to the increase in ebitda year over year 
aerospace systems segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased slightly to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses noted above  offset by the decreases in organic gross margin 
the ebitda margin remained relatively stable year over year 
aftermarket services the aftermarket services segment net sales increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the prior year period was negatively impacted by a decline in global commercial air traffic and airline inventory de stocking resulting in lower demand for the repair and overhaul of auxiliary power units and the brokering of similar units 
while we expect segment net sales to continue to experience growth over our prior fiscal year  it is unlikely it will continue at the current growth rates 
aftermarket services segment operating income increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  operating income increased primarily due to increased sales volume 
in addition  the sales volume increases improved our production efficiencies by increasing gross margins to from in the prior fiscal year 
also  the period was favorably impacted by the gain on sale of certain intellectual property million and decreased salaries and benefits million due to lower headcounts  as well as million in expenses incurred to shut down a service facility in austin  texas in the prior period 
these same factors contributed to the increase in ebitda year over year  however  the growth in ebitda was less than the growth in operating income  as depreciation and amortization was lower in fiscal year versus fiscal year aftermarket services segment operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared with for the fiscal year ended march   due to the increase in sales volume and related efficiencies noted above which also caused the improvement in the ebitda margin 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements 
during the year ended march   we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities  used approximately million in investing activities and used approximately million in financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities included million in pension contributions in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cash flows from operations for the fiscal year ended march  increased million  or  from the fiscal year ended march  our cash flows from operations increased due to an increase in net income of million  and an increase of million in noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization associated with the acquisition of vought  the write off of unamortized discounts and deferred financing fees on the extinguishment of the term loan and the reduction in income taxes paid due to the utilization of the net operating loss carryforward acquired in the acquisition of vought 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease of million in net working capital changes 
net working capital changes included increased cash uses for inventories of million for fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal due to production buildup and increases in capitalized pre production costs 
capitalized pre production costs are expected to continue to increase  while our production buildup is expected to decline over the next few quarters 
also  cash uses for excess funding above expense of our pension and other postretirement benefits plans increased to million for fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal in addition  cash uses for accounts receivable increased to million for fiscal  from million in fiscal due largely to the increase in sales

table of contents during february  we exercised existing authority to make stock repurchases and repurchased  shares of our outstanding shares under the program for an aggregate consideration of million  funded by borrowings under our credit facility 
in february  the company s board of directors then authorized an increase in our existing stock repurchase program by up to an additional  shares of our common stock 
as a result  as of may   we remain able to purchase an additional  shares 
repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions  block purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prevailing prices 
no time limit has been set for completion of the program 
on september   we issued million in convertible notes the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are direct  unsecured  senior subordinated obligations of the company  and rank i junior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  ii equal in right of payment with any other future senior subordinated indebtedness  and iii senior in right of payment to all subordinated indebtedness 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes of approximately million after deducting offering expenses of approximately million 
the use of the net proceeds from the sale was for prepayment of our then outstanding senior notes  including a make whole premium  fees and expenses in connection with the prepayment  and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility 
debt issuance costs were fully amortized as of september  the convertible notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  payable in cash semiannually in arrears on each april and october beginning april  during the period commencing on october  and ending on  but excluding  april  and each six month period from october to march or from april to september thereafter  the company will pay contingent interest during the applicable interest period if the average trading price of a note for the five consecutive trading days ending on the third trading day immediately preceding the first day of the relevant six month period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the convertible notes 
the contingent interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal per annum calculated on the average trading price of a note for the relevant five trading day period 
this contingent interest feature represents an embedded derivative 
since it is in the control of the company to call the convertible notes at any time after october   the value of the derivative was determined to be de minimis 
accordingly  no value has been assigned at issuance or at march  the convertible notes mature on october  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the company may redeem the notes for cash  either in whole or in part  anytime on or after october  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to but not including the date of redemption 
in addition  holders of the convertible notes will have the right to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their convertible notes on october   and  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any  up to  but not including  the date of repurchase 
the convertible notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a rate equal to shares per principal amount of the convertible notes equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment as described in the indenture 
upon conversion  the company will deliver to the holder surrendering the convertible notes for conversion  for each principal amount of convertible notes  an amount consisting of cash equal to the lesser of and the company s total conversion obligation and  to the extent that the company s total conversion obligation exceeds  at the company s election  cash or shares of the company s common stock in respect of the remainder 
the convertible notes are eligible for conversion upon meeting certain conditions as provided in the indenture agreement 
for the periods from january  through march   the convertible notes were eligible for conversion 
in march and april  the company received notice of conversion from holders of million in principal value of the convertible notes 
these conversions were settled in first quarter of fiscal with the principal settled in cash and the conversion benefit settled through the issuance of  shares 
in april  the company delivered a notice to holders of the convertible notes to the effect that  for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days preceding march   the closing price of the company s common stock was greater than or equal to of the conversion price of such notes on the last trading day 
under the terms of the convertible notes  the increase in the company s stock price triggered a provision  which gave holders of the convertible notes a put option through june  accordingly  the balance sheet classification of the convertible notes will be short term for as long as the put option remains in effect 
to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share  the average price of the company s common stock for the fiscal year must exceed the conversion price per share of 
the average price of the company s common stock for the fiscal years ended march  and was and  respectively 
accordingly   and  additional shares  respectively  were included in the diluted earnings per share calculation 
the average price of the company s stock for the fiscal year ended march  was 
therefore  no additional shares were included in the diluted earnings per share calculations for that fiscal year 

table of contents if the company undergoes a fundamental change  holders of the convertible notes will have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require the company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their convertible notes at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest and additional amounts  if any 
prior to fiscal  the company paid million to purchase million in principal amount of the convertible notes 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company settled the conversion of million in principal value of the convertible notes  as requested by the respective holders  with the principal settled in cash and the conversion benefit settled through the issuance of  shares

additional covenants require compliance with financial tests  including leverage and interest coverage ratio 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal year ended march  primarily for vought  which includes the construction of our facility in red oak  texas 
we funded these expenditures through borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect capital expenditures and investments in new major programs of approximately million to million for our fiscal year ending march   of which million will be reflected in inventory 
the expenditures are expected to be used mainly to expand capacity or replace old equipment at several facilities 
our expected future cash flows for the next five years for long term debt  leases and other obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands debt principal debt interest operating leases contingent payments purchase obligations total included in the company s consolidated balance sheet at march   plus discounts on notes and notes of million and million  respectively  being amortized to expense through november and july  respectively 
includes fixed rate interest only 
includes unrecorded contingent payments in connection with the fiscal acquisitions 
the above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of million as of march  since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities 

table of contents in addition to the financial obligations detailed in the table above  we also had obligations related to our benefit plans at march  as detailed in the following table 
our other postretirement benefits are not required to be funded in advance  so benefit payments are paid as they are incurred 
our expected net contributions and payments are included in the table below pension benefits other postretirement benefits in thousands projected benefit obligation at march  plan assets at march  projected contributions by fiscal year total current plan documents reserve our right to amend or terminate the plans at any time  subject to applicable collective bargaining requirements for represented employees 
we believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  we have a stated policy to grow through acquisitions and are continuously evaluating various acquisition opportunities 
as a result  we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates 
in the event that more than one of these transactions is successfully consummated  the availability under the credit facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed 
there can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us  if at all 
on may   the company entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement among the company  substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries and certain foreign subsidiaries as co borrowers thereunder  the lenders party thereto the lenders and pnc bank  national association  as administrative agent for the lenders the administrative agent 
the obligations under the amended credit agreement and related documents continue to be secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the company and its domestic subsidiaries 
pursuant to the amended credit agreement  the company and its subsidiary borrowers may borrow  repay and re borrow revolving credit loans  and cause to be issued letters of credit  in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed  million outstanding at any time  with a million accordion feature

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in determining the appropriate allowance  we consider a combination of factors  such as industry trends  our customers financial strength and credit standing  and payment and default history 
the calculation of the required allowance requires a judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are adjusted to actual amounts 
inventories the company records inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
costs on long term contracts and programs in progress represent recoverable costs incurred for production or contract specific facilities and equipment  allocable operating overhead  advances to suppliers 
pursuant to contract provisions  agencies of the us government and certain other customers have title to  or a security interest in  inventories related to such contracts as a result of advances  performance based payments  and progress payments 
the company reflects those advances and payments as an offset against the related inventory balances 
the company expenses general and administrative costs related to products and services provided essentially under commercial terms and conditions as incurred 
the company determines the costs of inventories by the first in  first out or average cost methods 
advance payments and progress payments received on contracts in process are first offset against related contract costs that are included in inventory  with any remaining amount reflected in current liabilities 
work in process inventory includes capitalized pre production costs 
capitalized pre production costs include certain contract costs  including applicable overhead  incurred before a product is manufactured on a recurring basis 
significant customer directed work changes can also cause pre production costs to be incurred 
these costs are typically recovered over a contractually determined number of ship set deliveries and the company believes these amounts will be fully recovered 
the balance of capitalized pre production costs at march  was million 
revenue and profit recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of our contracts are within the scope of accounting standards codification asc  revenue construction type and production type contracts  and revenue and costs on contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
accounting for the revenue and profit on a contract requires estimates of the contract value or total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s scope of work and the measurement of progress towards completion 
depending on the contract  we measure progress toward completion using either the cost to cost method or the units of delivery method  with the great majority measured under the units of delivery method 
under the cost to cost method  progress toward completion is measured as the ratio of total costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion 
we recognize costs as incurred 
profit is determined based on our estimated profit margin on the contract multiplied by our progress toward completion 
revenue represents the sum of our costs and profit on the contract for the period 
under the units of delivery method  revenue on a contract is recorded as the units are delivered and accepted during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units 
the costs recorded on a contract under the units of delivery method are equal to the total costs at completion divided by the total units to be delivered 
as our contracts can span multiple years  we often segment the contracts into production lots for the purposes of accumulating and allocating cost 
profit is recognized as the difference between revenue for the units delivered and the estimated costs for the units delivered 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenues  estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
these estimates are also sensitive to the assumed rate of production 
generally  the longer it takes to complete the contract quantity  the more relative overhead that contract will absorb 
the impact of revisions in cost estimates is recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident forward losses and are first offset against costs that are included in inventory  with any remaining amount reflected in accrued contract liabilities in accordance with asc revisions in contract estimates  if significant  can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows  as well as our valuation of inventory 
furthermore  certain contracts are combined or segmented for revenue recognition in accordance with asc 
table of contents for the fiscal year ended march   cumulative catch up adjustments resulting from changes in estimates increased operating income  net income and earnings per share by approximately million  million and  respectively 
the cumulative catch up adjustments to operating income for the fiscal year ended march  included gross favorable adjustments of approximately million and gross unfavorable adjustments of approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended march   there were no significant changes in estimates to our contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method that materially impacted the company s results of operations  cash flows  or inventory valuation 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are only included in revenue when such change orders or claims have been settled with our customer and to the extent that units have been delivered 
additionally  some contracts may contain provisions for revenue sharing  price re determination  requests for equitable adjustments  change orders or cost and or performance incentives 
such amounts or incentives are included in contract value when the amounts can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured 
although fixed price contracts  which extend several years into the future  generally permit us to keep unexpected profits if costs are less than projected  we also bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause the company to sustain losses on the contract 
in a fixed price contract  we must fully absorb cost overruns  not withstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs we will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of revenue that may otherwise be achieved 
our failure to anticipate technical problems  estimate delivery reductions  estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed price contract may reduce the profitability of a fixed price contract or cause a loss 
we believe we have recorded adequate provisions in the financial statements for losses on fixed price contracts  but we cannot be certain that the contract loss provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses 
included in net sales of the aerostructures group is the non cash amortization of acquired contract liabilities recognized as fair value adjustments through purchase accounting of the acquisition of vought 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  into net sales in our consolidated statement of income 
the aftermarket services group provides repair and overhaul services  certain of which are provided under long term power by the hour contracts  comprising approximately of the segment s net sales 
the company applies the proportional performance method to recognize revenue under these contracts 
revenue is recognized over the contract period as units are delivered based on the relative value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration 
in estimating the total contract consideration  management evaluates the projected utilization of its customer s fleet over the term of the contract  in connection with the related estimated repair and overhaul servicing requirements to the fleet based on such utilization 
changes in utilization of the fleet by customers  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require adjustments to estimates of revenue to be realized 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  rather  they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
additionally  intangible assets with finite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
upon acquisition  critical estimates are made in valuing acquired intangible assets  which include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  and estimating cash flows from projects when completed  tradename and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time that customer relationships will continue  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from the assumptions used in determining fair values 
the company s operating segments of aerostructures  aerospace systems and aftermarket services are also its reporting units under asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer and the chief financial officer comprise the company s codm 
the company s codm evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon review of segment information 
each of the operating segments is comprised of a number of operating units which are considered to be components under asc the components  for which discrete financial information exists  are aggregated for purposes of goodwill impairment testing 
the company s acquisition strategy is to acquire companies that complement and enhance the capabilities of the operating segments of the company 
each acquisition is assigned to either the aerostructures reporting unit  the aerospace systems reporting unit or the aftermarket services reporting unit 
the goodwill that results from each acquisition is also assigned to the reporting unit to which the acquisition is allocated  because it is that reporting unit which is intended to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
asc requires a two step impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step is required to be completed  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds 
table of contents the implied goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units is based  among other things  on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued 
we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least annually 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments 
we completed our required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that there was no impairment 
our methodology for determining the fair value of a reporting unit includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the company s cost of capital  otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method dcf 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses 
factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses  the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development  the future cost structure of the businesses  and future technological changes 
the company also incorporated market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified 
in the event that market multiples for stock price to ebitda in the aerospace and defense markets decrease  or the expected ebitda for our reporting units decreases  a goodwill impairment charge may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
no impairment charges have been incurred during the fiscal years ended march   and as of march   we had a million indefinite lived intangible asset associated with the vought tradename 
we test this intangible for impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair value based on current revenue projections of the related operations  under the relief from royalty method 
any excess carrying value over the amount of fair value is recognized as an impairment 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are evaluated for indicators of impairment 
when factors indicate that long lived assets  including intangible assets  should be evaluated for possible impairment  an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets  including intangible assets  is used to measure recoverability 
some of the more important factors we consider include our financial performance relative to our expected and historical performance  significant changes in the way we manage our operations  negative events that have occurred  and negative industry and economic trends 
if the carrying amount is less than the estimated fair value  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset group  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
during the fiscal year ended march   a million favorable fair value adjustment due to the reduction of the fair value of a contingent earnout liability associated with a prior acquisition due to changes in the projected earnings over the respective earnout periods 
the company also considered these changes in projected earnings to be an indicator of impairment of the long lived assets directly related to this acquisition and  as a result  tested these long lived assets for recoverability and concluded that the asset group was recoverable 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  there were no reductions to the remaining useful lives and no write downs of long lived assets  including intangible assets  were required 
acquired contract liabilities  net in connection with our acquisition of vought  we assumed existing long term contracts 
based on our review of these contracts  we concluded that the terms of certain contracts to be either more or less favorable than could be realized in market transactions as of the date of the acquisition 
as a result  we recognized acquired contract liabilities  net of acquired contract assets of million at the acquisition date based on the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows of the executory contracts and the estimated cash flows had the contracts been executed at the acquisition date 
the liabilities principally relate to long term life of program contracts that were initially executed by vought over years ago  as well as loss contracts for which vought had recognized significant pre acquisition contract loss reserves 
the acquired contract liabilities  net are being amortized as non cash revenues over the terms of the respective contracts 
in evaluating acquired contract liabilities  net  our analysis involved considerable management judgment and assumptions  including determining the market rates that would be received if the existing contracts were executed at the acquisition date and the comparability of similar contracts executed at the acquisition date 
the company recognized net amortization of contract liabilities of approximately million and million in the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  and such amounts have been included in revenues in our results of operations 
the balance of the liability as of march  is approximately million and  based on the expected delivery schedule of the underlying contracts  the company estimates annual amortization of the liability as follows million  million  million  million  million 

table of contents postretirement plans the liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  the assumed average rate of compensation increase and rate of growth for medical costs 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate these costs are reviewed annually or when a remeasurement is necessary 
assumptions are based upon management s best estimates  after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries  as of the measurement date 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based on a point in time estimate as of our annual measurement date or as of remeasurement dates as needed 
this rate is determined based upon a review of yield rates associated with long term  high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that discount projected benefit payments using the spot rates developed from the yields on selected long term  high quality corporate bonds 
the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
the discount rate at march  decreased to from at march  the assumed expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation pbo 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on the counsel of our outside investment advisors 
this rate is based on actual historical returns and anticipated long term performance of individual asset classes with consideration given to the related investment strategy 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year differs from the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
the gain or loss reduces or increases future pension expense over the average remaining service period of active plan participants expected to receive benefits 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal is  compared to for fiscal and the assumed average rate of compensation increase represents the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees 
this rate is utilized principally in calculating the pbo and annual pension expense 
in addition to our defined benefit pension plans  we provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees 
such benefits are unfunded as of march  employees achieve eligibility to participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from active service if they meet specified age and years of service requirements 
election to participate for eligible employees must be made at the date of retirement 
qualifying dependents at the date of retirement are also eligible for medical coverage 
current plan documents reserve our right to amend or terminate the plans at any time  subject to applicable collective bargaining requirements for represented employees 
from time to time  we have made changes to the benefits provided to various groups of plan participants 
premiums charged to most retirees for medical coverage prior to age are based on years of service and are adjusted annually for changes in the cost of the plans as determined by an independent actuary 
in addition to this medical inflation cost sharing feature  the plans also have provisions for deductibles  co payments  coinsurance percentages  out of pocket limits  schedules of reasonable fees  preferred provider networks  coordination of benefits with other plans  and a medicare carve out 
in accordance with the compensation retirement benefits topic of the asc  we recognized the funded status of our benefit obligation 
this funded status is remeasured as of our annual remeasurement date 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the pbo or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of the plan 
in order to recognize the funded status  we determined the fair value of the plan assets 
the majority of our plan assets are publicly traded investments which were valued based on the market price as of the date of remeasurement 
investments that are not publicly traded were valued based on the estimated fair value of those investments as of the remeasurement date based on our evaluation of data from fund managers and comparable market data 
the company periodically experiences events or makes changes to its benefit plans that result in special charges 
some require remeasurements 
the following summarizes the key events whose effects on our net periodic benefit cost and obligations that occurred during the fiscal year ended march  in february  the company s second largest union represented group of production and maintenance employees ratified a new collective bargaining agreement 
the agreement provides actively employed participants the option to elect a lump sum distribution upon retirement effective april  this change resulted in reduction to the projected benefit obligation of approximately million 
in december  the company negotiated the termination of one its smaller defined benefit plans 
this termination resulted in a million special termination benefit  included in the curtailment gain  net on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended march  in march  the company announced an amendment to the retirement plans of its non represented employee 
table of contents participants 
effective april   most actively employed participants with years of service and certain highly compensated employees as of april  will no longer continue to accrue a benefit 
those changes resulted in a reduction of the projected pension obligation of approximately million and a related curtailment gain of million included in curtailment gain  net on the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended march  pension income  including curtailment gain for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared with pension expense of million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  for the fiscal year ending march   the company expects to recognize pension income of approximately million 
excluding the effect of the net curtailment gain in fiscal  the significant increase in expected pension income in fiscal year results principally from the plan amendments noted above and asset performance in fiscal year exceeding the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
the amendments in this update will require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the intention is to enhance required disclosures by improving information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with fasb guidance or are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement  irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with fasb guidance 
the provisions of asu are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  the adoption of the provisions of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu 
the amendments in this update will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
adoption of the provisions of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu  compensation retirement benefits multiemployer plans subtopic disclosures about an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan asu 
the amendments in this update require additional disclosures about an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan 
for public entities  the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after december   and thus were effective for the company for the fiscal year ended march  the amendments should be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented 
adoption of the provisions of asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
effective march   the company retrospectively adopted asu  presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu was issued to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
this guidance requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements where the first statement includes the components of net income and the second statement includes the components of oci 
regardless of whether an entity chooses to present comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements  the guidance also would have required an entity to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
however  subsequent to the issuance of asu  this requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of oci in both net income and oci on the face of the financial statements was deferred for further evaluation 
the deferral did not change the requirement to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements 
the company has elected to present two separate consecutive statements 
the adoption of this standard resulted in a change in presentation and additional footnote disclosure that did not have a significant impact on the company 

table of contents forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of relating to our future operations and prospects  including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate  and management s beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information 
such statements are based on management s beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  words like may  might  will  expect  anticipate  believe  potential  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from management s current expectations 
for example  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital  if required  will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us 
in addition to these factors  among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially  are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses  including without limitation vought  general economic conditions affecting our business segments  dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers  the risk that we will not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the acquisition of vought as well as competitive factors relating to the aerospace industry 
for a more detailed discussion of these and other factors affecting us  see the risk factors described in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk some contracts with our suppliers for raw materials  component parts and other goods are short term contracts  which are subject to termination on a relatively short term basis 
the prices of our raw materials and component parts fluctuate depending on market conditions  and substantial increases in prices could increase our operating costs  which  as a result of our fixed price contracts  we may not be able to recoup through increases in the prices of our products 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we continue to review a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
foreign exchange risk in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate foreign denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the respective foreign currencies will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and stockholders equity 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with forecasted foreign denominated payments related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at march   a change in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would not have material impact on our unrealized gains 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations and expansion 
in addition  an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  if permitted to do so under certain of our debt arrangements  including the credit facility 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt 
as of march   approximately of our debt is fixed rate debt 
our financing policy states that we generally maintain between and of our debt as fixed rate debt 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of notes 
table of contents to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents principal cash flows and the related interest rates
