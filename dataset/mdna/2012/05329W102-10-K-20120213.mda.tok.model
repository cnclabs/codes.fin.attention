item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this form k 
certain reclassifications of amounts previously reported have been made to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in order to maintain consistency and comparability between periods presented 
except to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis 
overview autonation  inc  through its subsidiaries  is the largest automotive retailer in the united states 
as of december   we owned and operated new vehicle franchises from stores located in the united states  predominantly in major metropolitan markets in the sunbelt region 
our stores  which we believe include some of the most recognizable and well known in our key markets  sell different brands of new vehicles 
the core brands of vehicles that we sell  representing approximately of the new vehicles that we sold in  are manufactured by ford  toyota  nissan  general motors  honda  mercedes benz  bmw  and chrysler 
we offer a diversified range of automotive products and services  including new vehicles  used vehicles  parts and automotive repair and maintenance services also referred to as parts and service  and automotive finance and insurance products also referred to as finance and insurance  which includes the arranging of financing for vehicle purchases through third party finance sources 
we believe that the significant scale of our operations and the quality of our managerial talent allow us to achieve efficiencies in our key markets by  among other things  leveraging our market brands and advertising  improving asset management  implementing standardized processes  and increasing productivity across all of our stores 
as of december   we had three operating segments domestic  import  and premium luxury 
our domestic segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured by general motors  ford  and chrysler 
our import segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by toyota  honda  and nissan 
our premium luxury segment is comprised of retail automotive franchises that sell new vehicles manufactured primarily by mercedes benz  bmw  and lexus 
the franchises in each segment also sell used vehicles  parts and automotive repair and maintenance services  and automotive finance and insurance products 
for the year ended december   new vehicle sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue  but approximately of our total gross profit 
used vehicle sales accounted for approximately of our total revenue  and approximately of our total gross profit 
our parts and service and finance and insurance operations  while comprising approximately of total revenue  contributed approximately of our gross profit 
results of operations we had net income from continuing operations of million and diluted earnings per share of in  as compared to net income from continuing operations of million and diluted earnings per share of in  and net income from continuing operations of million and diluted earnings per share of in the results were impacted by a loss on debt extinguishment  including debt refinancing costs and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs  of million million after tax 
the results were impacted by a loss on debt extinguishment  including debt refinancing costs and the write off of previously deferred debt issuance costs  of million million after tax 
the results were impacted by a favorable tax adjustment of approximately million  a net gain on asset sales and dispositions of million million after tax  and a gain on senior note repurchases of million million after tax 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our results of operations for were also favorably impacted by the consumer assistance to recycle and save act of  
table of contents commonly referred to as cash for clunkers  that officially began in july and ended in august cash for clunkers stimulated consumer demand for new vehicles  and we sold approximately  new vehicles under the program 
market conditions full year us industry new vehicle unit sales were million in  as compared to million in and million in while unemployment in the united states remained high  housing markets remained depressed  and the saar remained below pre recession levels  we saw an improving automotive retail market during as compared to the past few years  and we expect continued improvement over the next several years 
we currently anticipate full year us industry new vehicle unit sales will increase to approximately million in however  actual sales may materially differ 
in  the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan and the flooding in thailand caused significant production and supply chain disruptions that resulted in significantly reduced new vehicle production and lower new vehicle shipments by japanese manufacturers 
these disruptions also impacted non japanese manufacturers that rely on components produced in japan and or thailand 
in  our unit sales of new vehicles were adversely impacted by these disruptions  however  gross profit per vehicle retailed benefited significantly from constrained supply 
shipments from japanese manufacturers began to improve at the end of the third quarter and continued to improve in the fourth quarter of we expect that the improving supply environment will result in lower gross profit per vehicle retailed in while we believe that new vehicle unit sales will improve in and over the next several years  we also believe that the automotive retail market will remain challenging and that the annual rate of new vehicle unit sales will remain below pre recession levels in the rate of industry new vehicle unit sales over the past few years has led to a decline in the number of recent model year vehicles in operation  our primary service base  and it may take several years for this service base to return to pre recession levels 
debt refinancing please refer to liquidity and capital resources debt refinancing transactions below for a discussion of certain refinancing transactions that we completed during the second quarter of  the fourth quarter of  and the first quarter of inventory management our new and used vehicle inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have generally not experienced losses on the sale of new vehicle inventory  in part due to incentives provided by manufacturers to promote sales of new vehicles and our inventory management practices 
we had  units in new vehicle inventory at december   and  units at december  we continue to monitor our new vehicle inventory levels closely based on current economic conditions and will adjust them as appropriate 
in general  used vehicles that are not sold on a retail basis are liquidated at wholesale auctions 
we record estimated losses on used vehicle inventory expected to be liquidated at wholesale auctions at a loss 
our used vehicle inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of million at december   and million at december  parts  accessories  and other inventory are carried at the lower of acquisition cost first in  first out method or market 
we estimate the amount of potential obsolete inventory based upon past experience and market trends 
our parts  accessories  and other inventory balance was net of cumulative write downs of million at december   and million at december  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable 
actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
set 
table of contents forth below are the policies and estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations  based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on april or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill as of april   and no goodwill impairment charges resulted from the required impairment test 
the goodwill impairment analysis is dependent on many variables used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using an income valuation approach  which discounts projected free cash flows of the reporting unit at a computed weighted average cost of capital as the discount rate 
the income valuation approach requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include revenue growth rates and future operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  weighted average costs of capital  and future economic and market conditions 
in connection with this process  we also reconcile the estimated aggregate fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization  including consideration of a control premium that represents the estimated amount an investor would pay for our equity securities to obtain a controlling interest 
we believe this reconciliation process is consistent with a market participant perspective 
we base our cash flow forecasts on our knowledge of the automotive industry  our recent performance  our expectations of our future performance  and other assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we also make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step approach 
a first step failure would have required us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of implied fair value of goodwill and  if required  the recognition of a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
as of december   we have million of goodwill related to the domestic reporting unit  million related to the import reporting unit  and million related to the premium luxury reporting unit 
a significant change in the assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with our reporting units 
the fair values of the domestic  import  and premium luxury reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values as of april   the date of our most recent annual impairment test 
other intangible assets our principal identifiable intangible assets are individual store rights under franchise agreements with vehicle manufacturers  which have indefinite lives and are tested at least annually on april for impairment 
the impairment test for intangibles with indefinite lives requires the comparison of estimated fair value to its carrying value by store 
fair values of rights under franchise agreements are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows of the store 
the forecasted cash flows contain inherent uncertainties  including significant estimates and assumptions related to growth rates  margins  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and cost of capital  for which we utilize certain market participant based assumptions  using third party industry projections  economic projections  and other marketplace data we believe to be reasonable 
we completed our annual impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite lives as of april   and no impairment charges resulted from the required impairment tests 
our franchise rights  which related to franchises and totaled million at april   are evaluated for impairment on a franchise by franchise basis 
if the fair value of each of our franchise rights had been determined to a be a hypothetical lower as of the valuation date of april   the resulting impairment charge would have been less than million 
long lived assets we estimate the depreciable lives of our property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  and review them for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may be impaired 
such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value  a significant change in the business climate in a particular market  a current expectation that more likely than not a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly 
table of contents before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses 
when evaluating potential impairment of long lived assets held and used  we first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group  we then compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group s estimated fair value to determine if impairment exists 
the fair value measurements for our long lived assets held and used are based on level inputs  which considered information obtained from third party real estate valuation sources 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about our fair value measurements 
we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset group s carrying amount exceeds the asset group s estimated fair value 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset group becomes its new cost basis 
for a depreciable long lived asset  the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 
when property and equipment is identified as held for sale  we reclassify the held for sale assets to other current assets and cease recording depreciation 
we measure each long lived asset or disposal group at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and recognize a loss for any initial adjustment of the long lived asset s or disposal group s carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of assets held for sale to determine if  based on market conditions  the values of these assets should be adjusted 
any subsequent change in the fair value less cost to sell increase or decrease of each asset held for sale is reported as an adjustment to its carrying amount  except that the adjusted carrying amount cannot exceed the carrying amount of the long lived asset or disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale 
the fair value measurements for our long lived assets held for sale were based on level inputs  which considered information obtained from third party real estate valuation sources  or  in certain cases  pending agreements to sell the related assets 
we had assets held for sale in continuing operations of million at december   and million at december  we recorded million during and million during of non cash impairment charges associated with assets held for sale in continuing operations to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value less cost to sell 
during  we also recorded million of non cash impairment charges related to a valuation adjustment for the cumulative depreciation not recorded during the held for sale period for continuing operations assets that were reclassified from held for sale to held and used during the and charges are recorded as a component of other expenses income  net in the consolidated income statements and are reported in the corporate and other category of our segment information 
we had assets held for sale in discontinued operations of million at december   and million at december  we recorded million during and million during of non cash impairment charges associated with assets held for sale in discontinued operations to reduce the carrying value of these assets to fair value less cost to sell 
these charges are recorded as a component of loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated income statements 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future undiscounted cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets 
although we believe our property and equipment and assets held for sale are appropriately valued  the assumptions and estimates used may change and we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the value of these assets 
chargeback reserve revenue on finance and insurance products represents commissions earned by us for i loans and leases placed with financial institutions in connection with customer vehicle purchases financed  ii vehicle service contracts sold  and iii insurance and other products sold 
we primarily sell these products on a straight commission basis  however we also participate in future underwriting profit on certain extended service contracts pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as earned 
we may be charged back for commissions related to financing  insurance  or vehicle protection products in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers chargebacks 
these commissions are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles  net of an estimated liability for chargebacks 

table of contents we estimate our liability for chargebacks on an individual product basis using our historical chargeback experience  based primarily on cancellation data we receive from third parties that sell and administer these products 
our estimated liability for chargebacks totaled million at december   and million at december  chargebacks are influenced by the volume of vehicle sales in recent years and increases or decreases in early termination rates resulting from cancellation of vehicle protection products  defaults  refinancings  payoffs before maturity  and other factors 
while we consider these factors in the estimation of our chargeback liability  actual events may differ from our estimates  which could result in a change in our estimated liability for chargebacks 
the increase in our liability for chargebacks is largely attributable to higher volume of vehicle sales in recent years  as well as an increase in customer cancellations of finance and insurance products 
a change in our estimated chargebacks would have changed our estimated liability for chargebacks at december   by approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated finance statements for further information regarding chargeback liabilities 
self insurance reserves under our self insurance programs  we retain various levels of aggregate loss limits  per claim deductibles  and claims handling expenses as part of our various insurance programs  including property and casualty  employee medical benefits  automobile  and workers compensation 
costs in excess of this retained risk per claim may be insured under various contracts with third party insurance carriers 
we review our claim and loss history on a periodic basis to assist in assessing our future liability 
the ultimate costs of these retained insurance risks are estimated by management and by third party actuarial evaluation of historical claims experience  adjusted for current trends and changes in claims handling procedures 
our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to our self insurance programs if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
self insurance reserves totaled million at december   and million at december  a change in the volume of claims would have changed our estimated liability at december   by approximately million 
we believe our actual loss experience has not been materially different from our recorded estimates 
revenue recognition revenue consists of the sales of new and used vehicles  sales of parts and services  commissions from finance and insurance products  and sales of other products 
we recognize revenue in the period in which products are sold or services are provided 
we recognize vehicle and finance and insurance revenue when a sales contract has been executed  the vehicle has been delivered  and payment has been received or financing has been arranged 
rebates  holdbacks  floorplan assistance  and certain other incentives received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the vehicle and recognized into income upon the sale of the vehicle or when earned under a specific manufacturer program  whichever is later 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenue recognition 
income taxes estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we regularly evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances to offset portions of deferred tax assets due to uncertainty surrounding the future realization of such deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we adjust the valuation allowance in the period we determine it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will or will not be realized 
if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would be adjusted in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 
accounting for our income taxes also requires significant judgment in the evaluation of our uncertain tax positions and in the calculation of our provision for income taxes 
accounting standards related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribe a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate available evidence to determine if it appears more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will be sustained on an audit by a taxing authority  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settling the uncertain tax position 

table of contents although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  the ultimate outcome of these tax matters may differ from our expectations 
we adjust our reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the completion of a tax audit  expiration of a statute of limitations  the refinement of an estimate  and interest accruals associated with uncertain tax positions until they are resolved 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in our deferred tax assets or liabilities  the valuation of our uncertain tax positions  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
other additionally  significant estimates have been made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements including allowances for doubtful accounts  accruals related to certain legal proceedings  estimated losses from disposals of discontinued operations  and certain assumptions related to determining stock based compensation
