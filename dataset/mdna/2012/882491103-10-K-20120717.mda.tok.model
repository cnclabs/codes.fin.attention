item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the southwestern united states through our three business segments cement  aggregates and consumer products 
our principal products are gray portland cement  produced and sold through our cement segment  stone  sand and gravel  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and ready mix concrete  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
other products include expanded shale and clay lightweight aggregates  produced and sold through our aggregates segment 
our facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california 
we own long term reserves of the primary raw materials for the production of cement and aggregates 
our business requires large amounts of capital investment  energy  labor and maintenance 
even though the national economy experienced some growth during fiscal year  construction activity remained at low levels 
as a consequence  throughout fiscal year we continued with many of the steps that we began taking in fiscal year in response to the recession 
we also continued to assess other actions that may help us reduce costs  conserve cash or improve our sales or operations 
these steps and others are indicative of our intense focus on cost reduction  management of our cash position and management of production levels  which we believe had a significant positive impact on our operating results in the last three fiscal years 
in october we commenced construction on a project to expand our hunter  texas cement plant 
in may we temporarily halted construction on the project because we believed that economic and market conditions made it unlikely that cement demand levels in texas at that time would permit the new kiln to operate profitably if the project was completed as originally scheduled 
we resumed construction in october and expect to begin commissioning in the fall of the total capital cost of the project is expected to be between million and million  excluding capitalized interest 
as of may   we have incurred million  excluding capitalized interest of million related to the project  of which million has been paid 
in april we entered into an asset exchange transaction in which we acquired the ready mix operations of transit mix concrete and materials company  a subsidiary of trinity industries  inc  that serve the central texas market from north of san antonio to hillsboro  texas 
in exchange for the ready mix facilities  we transferred to trinity materials  inc  also a subsidiary of trinity industries  inc  the aggregate operations at the anacoco sand and gravel plant  which serves the southwest louisiana and southeast texas markets  and the paradise and beckett sand and gravel plants  which both serve the north texas market 
the exchange resulted in the acquisition of ready mix property  plant and equipment of million and the recognition of a gain of million in the gain from the transaction is reported in our aggregates segment  and the operating results of the acquired ready mix operations are reported in our consumer products segment 
in july we entered into an asset exchange transaction with cemex usa in which we acquired three ready mix concrete plants and a sand and gravel plant that serve the austin  texas metropolitan market 
in exchange  we transferred to cemex usa seven ready mix concrete plants in the houston  texas market  and we designated four non operating ready mix plant sites in the houston area as surplus real estate 
the exchange resulted in the acquisition of ready mix and aggregate property  plant and equipment of million and the recognition of a gain of million in the gain from the transaction and the operating results of the acquired ready mix operations are reported in our consumer products segment  and the operating results of the acquired sand and gravel operations are reported in our aggregates segment 
in november we entered into a joint venture agreement with ratliff ready mix  lp  a ready mix operator based in waco  texas 
we contributed seven of our central texas ready mix plants and certain related assets to the joint venture and guaranteed  or million of the debt of the joint venture 
the fair value of our equity interest in the joint venture was million which resulted in the recognition of a gain of 
table of contents million in the gain from the transaction and our proportional share of the joint venture operating results are reported in our consumer products segment 
in april we sold our texas based package products operations to bonsal american  a unit of oldcastle  inc the transaction included five production facilities that serve the texas market from the dallas fort worth area of north texas to the houston area of south texas and extending through austin and central texas 
the sale resulted in the recognition of a gain of million in as a part of the agreement  we have entered into a long term cement supply agreement with bonsal american and will continue to produce and sell packaged cement and masonry cements in the texas region 
the gain from the transaction is reported in our consumer products segment 
in april we sold our aggregate rail distribution terminal and associated assets located in stafford  texas to lex missouri city  lp  which resulted in the recognition of a gain of million in that is reported in our aggregates segment

business segment operating profit consists of net sales less operating costs and expenses that are directly attributable to the segment 
corporate includes non operating income and expenses related to administrative  financial  legal  human resources  environmental and real estate activities

management reviews our deferred tax position and in particular our deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that the assets may not be realized in the future and records a valuation allowance unless such deferred tax assets are deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets depends upon various factors including the generation of taxable income during future periods 
the company s deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities as of may  and may  management has concluded that the sources of taxable income we are permitted to consider do not assure 
table of contents the realization of the entire amount of our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  a valuation allowance was required due to the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million in through a charge to other comprehensive loss given the increase in actuarial losses in our retirement plans in when the company was otherwise profitable 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that an estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that an estimable liability has been incurred 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out lifo method to value finished products  work in process and raw material inventories excluding natural aggregate inventories 
natural aggregate inventories and parts and supplies inventories are valued using the average cost method 
our natural aggregate inventory excludes volumes in excess of an average twelve month period of actual sales 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets on a facility by facility basis for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows reflect management s belief that it operates in a cyclical industry and that we are at a low point in the cycle 
income taxes 
texas industries  inc the parent company joins in filing a consolidated return with its subsidiaries based on federal and certain state tax filing requirements 
certain subsidiaries also file separate state income tax returns 
current and deferred tax expense is allocated among the members of the group based on a stand alone calculation of the tax of the individual member 
we recognize and classify deferred income taxes using an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the year the tax returns are filed 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state authorities which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we account for these uncertain tax issues using a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step determines if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step measures the tax benefit as the 
table of contents largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  judicial rulings  refinement of estimates  or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters differs from the amounts recorded  such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate including related interest and penalties 
management reviews our deferred tax position and in particular our deferred tax assets whenever circumstances indicate that the assets may not be realized in the future and would record a valuation allowance unless such deferred tax assets were deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon various factors including the generation of taxable income during future periods 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we consider such factors as historical earnings  the reversal of existing temporary differences  prior taxable income if carryback is permitted under the tax law  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
recently issued accounting guidance in june  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this new guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which defers the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the new guidance is effective for us on june  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
