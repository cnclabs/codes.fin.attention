critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical 
table of contents experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  stock based compensation  business combinations  goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from the licensing of software products  associated software maintenance and support plans  custom software development  non software related hosting services  consulting services  training and technical support 
we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of software  upgrades  maintenance and support  hosting services  and consulting 
for our software and software related multiple element arrangements  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and allocate the total price among the various elements 
vsoe of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the undelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements 
absent vsoe  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
however  if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
we determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support services  custom software development services  consulting services and training 
in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using best estimated selling price besp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vsoe of selling price or third party evidence tpe of selling price  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after november  the application of these new accounting standards  if applied in the same manner to the year ended november   would not have had a material impact on total net revenues for that fiscal year 
for multiple element arrangements containing our non software services  we must determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of fair value  tpe besp  as applicable  and allocate the total price among the various elements based on the relative selling price method 
for multiple element arrangements that contain software and non software elements such as our hosted offerings  we allocate revenue to software or software related elements as a group and any non software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or tpe of selling 
table of contents price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use its besp for that deliverable 
once revenue is allocated to software or software related elements as a group  it follows historic software accounting guidance 
revenue is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
when we are unable to establish selling prices using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non software elements and as such  we use besp 
besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to major product groupings  geographies  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  gross margin objectives and pricing practices 
significant pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices  volume discounts where applicable and our price lists 
given the nature of our transactions  which are primarily software and software related  our go to market strategies and our pricing practices  total net revenue as reported during the year ended december  is materially consistent with total net revenue that would have been reported if the transactions entered into or materially modified after november  were subject to previous accounting guidance 
in addition to multiple element arrangements  we must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
product revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns  price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded 
in determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
product returns may be more or less than what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we offer price protection to our distributors that allows for the right to a credit if we permanently reduce the price of a software product 
when evaluating the adequacy of the price protection allowance  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories 
changes to these assumptions or in the economic environment could result in higher returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protection may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
we recognize revenues for hosting services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the customer commences use of our services and continuing through the end of the customer term 
over usage fees  and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data  are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 

table of contents for our ongoing traditional employee equity awards  we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our stock based compensation expense could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assumed equity awards  as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the equity awards assumed 
the estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees exercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold 
if the acquired company has significant historical data on their employee s exercise behavior  then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company s history 
otherwise  our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold 
zero coupon yields implied by us treasury issuances  implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to the binomial model 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill impairment we complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis  during the second quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may 
table of contents exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal and determined there was no impairment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced changes to in our business strategy which resulted in a reduction of forecasted revenue for certain of our products 
we performed an update to our goodwill impairment test for the enterprise reporting unit and determined there was no impairment 
the results of our annual impairment test and our update in the fourth quarter for our enterprise reporting unit indicate there is no significant risk of future material goodwill impairment in any of our reporting units 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authorities  including a current examination by the irs for our fiscal and tax returns 
these examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we are a united states based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries 
in addition to providing for us income taxes on earnings from the us  we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the us while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings  if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated  the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 
our income tax expense has differed from the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete items and to earnings considered as permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned  by changes in  or our interpretation of  tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business  by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates  by lapses of the availability of the us research and development tax credit  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet effective there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance  or potential significance  to our consolidated financial statements

revenue from omniture increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was due to continued demand for our online marketing suite 
revenue from print and publishing decreased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower shockwave revenue and the release of coldfusion at the end of fiscal for which a comparable release did not occur in the current year 
also contributing to the decline was a one time large deal in adobe captivate and our tech communications products during fiscal that did not recur in fiscal fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue prior year information below has been updated to reflect our fiscal segment changes revenue from creative solutions increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to strong licensing of cs during fiscal until the release of cs  as well as strong adoption of cs beginning in the second quarter of fiscal the increase was driven largely by a increase in creative suite products related revenue as compared to the prior year 
excluding large enterprise license agreement ela deals  the overall number of units licensed increased and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from digital media solutions increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue associated with our image editing products and to a lesser extent our video authoring products

excluding ela deals  the overall number of units licensed increased and unit average selling prices remained relatively stable during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from knowledge worker increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute this success to strength in enterprise licensing of acrobat and improved economic conditions in certain markets and geographies where we focus on acrobat adoption 
an increase in the number of units licensed also contributed to the increase in revenue 
unit average selling prices  excluding large ela deals  have remained relatively stable 
revenue from enterprise increased million during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased adoption of our livecycle and adobe connect products as well as the acquisition of day  which closed late in the fourth quarter of fiscal and contributed million in revenue

amortization of purchased intangibles and incomplete technology during the last several years  we have completed a number of business combinations and asset acquisitions including macromedia in fiscal  omniture in fiscal  day in fiscal and eight smaller acquisitions in fiscal as a result of these acquisitions  we purchased intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from one to twelve years 
amortization expense decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of macromedia that were fully amortized at the end of fiscal this decrease was offset in part by an increase in amortization expense as a result of intangible assets purchased through our acquisition of day in the fourth quarter of fiscal as well as an increase in intangible assets purchased through our fiscal acquisitions

these costs were partially offset by tax benefits related to a favorable state income tax ruling and the reinstatement of the federal research and development tax credit 
our effective tax rate decreased approximately twenty seven percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion in the fourth quarter of fiscal of a us income tax examination covering fiscal years through and stronger international profits  partially offset by the expiration of the research and development credit on december  
table of contents we are a united states based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
a significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiaries 
in addition to providing for us income taxes on earnings from the us  we provide for us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless the subsidiaries earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the us while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings  if certain foreign earnings previously treated as permanently reinvested are repatriated  the related us tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes paid on these earnings 
currently  there are a significant amount of foreign earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
if the total unrecognized tax benefits at december  were recognized in the future  million of unrecognized tax benefits would decrease the effective tax rate  which is net of an estimated million federal benefit related to deducting certain payments on future state tax returns 
as of december   the combined amount of accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was approximately million 
this amount is included in non current income taxes payable 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that within the next months  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from to approximately million

the primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal were increases in trade receivables coupled with decreases in accrued expenses and taxes payable 
trade receivables increased primarily as a result of overall higher sales levels and billing occurring during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal  offset in part by an increased rate of collection for omniture services 
decreases in accrued expenses were primarily related to lower accrued bonus levels in fiscal during fiscal  we also made our second and third semi annual interest payments associated with our notes totaling million

trade receivables increased as a result of products shipped and billed during the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the launch of acrobat x and slower receivable payments pertaining to omniture services 
increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets related primarily to higher valuations on our cash flow and balance sheet hedges due to the strengthening of the us dollar 
income taxes payable decreased primarily due to payments of approximately million for tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings as well as a million settlement of an irs exam in the fourth quarter of fiscal accrued restructuring decreased primarily due to payments made related to the fiscal restructuring plan that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition to adjustments made to previously recorded estimates  offset in part by new charges

furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire companies  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
restructuring during the past several years  we have initiated various restructuring plans 
currently  we have the following five active restructuring plans  two of which were the result of large acquisitions fiscal restructuring plan fiscal restructuring plan fiscal restructuring plan omniture restructuring plan macromedia restructuring plan as of december   we have accrued total restructuring charges of approximately million of which approximately million relates to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations that are expected to be paid during fiscal the remaining million relates to the cost of closing redundant facilities and are expected to be paid under contract through fiscal of which approximately will be paid through during fiscal  we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately million which consisted of approximately million and million in payments related to termination benefits and contract terminations and the closing of redundant facilities  respectively 
as of december   we accrued total restructuring charges of approximately million of which approximately million related to ongoing termination benefits and contract terminations which were paid during the first quarter of fiscal the remaining million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities and were expected to be paid under contract through fiscal of which over will be paid through during fiscal  we made payments related to the above restructuring plans totaling approximately million which consisted of approximately million related to termination benefits and contract terminations and approximately million related to the cost of closing redundant facilities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the cash outlays for the restructuring actions described above 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information regarding our restructuring plans 
other liquidity and capital resources considerations our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal due to changes in our planned cash outlay  including changes in incremental costs such as direct and integration costs related to our acquisitions 
our cash and investments totaled billion as of december  of this amount  approximately was held by our foreign subsidiaries and subject to material repatriation tax effects 
our intent is to permanently reinvest a significant portion of our earnings from foreign operations  and current plans do not anticipate that we will need funds generated from foreign operations to fund our domestic operations 
in the event funds from foreign operations are needed to fund operations in the united states and if us tax has not already been previously provided  we would provide for and pay additional us taxes in connection with repatriating these funds 

table of contents cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the notes was billion 
there is no outstanding balance under our credit facility and the entire billion credit line under this facility remains available for borrowing 
we use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our invested cash 
external investment firms managed  on average  of our consolidated invested balances during the fourth quarter of fiscal the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in corporate bonds and commercial paper  foreign government securities  municipal securities  us agency securities and us treasury securities 
stock repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors approved an amendment to our stock repurchase program authorized in april from a non expiring share based authority to a time constrained dollar based authority 
as part of this amendment  the board of directors granted authority to repurchase up to billion in common stock through the end of fiscal during fiscal  and  we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions  whereupon we provided them with prepayments totaling million  million and million  respectively 
of the million of prepayments during fiscal  million was under the stock repurchase program prior to the program amendment and the remaining million was under the amended billion time constrained dollar based authority 
we enter into these agreements in order to take advantage of repurchasing shares at a guaranteed discount to the volume weighted average price vwap of our common stock over a specified period of time 
we only enter into such transactions when the discount that we receive is higher than the foregone return on our cash prepayments to the financial institutions 
there were no explicit commissions or fees on these structured repurchases 
under the terms of the agreements  there is no requirement for the financial institutions to return any portion of the prepayment to us 
the financial institutions agree to deliver shares to us at monthly intervals during the contract term 
the parameters used to calculate the number of shares deliverable are the total notional amount of the contract  the number of trading days in the contract  the number of trading days in the interval and the average vwap of our stock during the interval less the agreed upon discount 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased approximately million shares at an average price per share of through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal and fiscal for fiscal  and  the prepayments were classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets at the payment date  though only shares physically delivered to us by december   december  and november  were excluded from the computation of earnings per share 
as of december  and december  no prepayments remained under the agreements 
as of november   approximately million of prepayments remained under the agreements 
subsequent to december   as part of our billion stock repurchase program  we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of million 
this amount will be classified as treasury stock on our consolidated balance sheets 
upon completion of the million stock repurchase agreement  million remains under our time constrained dollar based authority

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december  consist of obligations under operating leases  capital leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our contractual commitments 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions payment due by period total less than year years years more than years notes operating leases capital lease obligations purchase obligations total notes in february  we issued million of senior notes due february  and million of senior notes due february  interest on the notes is payable semi annually  in arrears on february and august  commencing on august  during fiscal interest payments totaled million 
at december   our maximum commitment for interest payments under the notes was million 
capital lease obligation in june  we entered into a sale leaseback agreement to sell equipment totaling million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of months 
this transaction was classified as a capital lease obligation and recorded at fair value 
covenants our credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring us not to exceed a certain maximum leverage ratio 
our leases for the east and west towers and the almaden tower are both subject to standard covenants including certain financial ratios as defined in the lease agreements that are reported to the lessors quarterly 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants 
our notes do not contain any financial covenants 
we believe these covenants will not impact our credit or cash in the coming fiscal year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
under the terms of our credit agreement and lease agreements  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment would trigger an event of default or one currently exists 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents accounting for uncertainty in income taxes the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits at december  was million  exclusive of interest and penalties 
the timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments that are part of any audit settlement process 
these events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current and non current assets and liabilities 
we believe that within the next months  it is reasonably possible that either certain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire  or both 
given the uncertainties described above  we can only determine a range of estimated potential decreases in underlying unrecognized tax benefits ranging from to approximately million 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
guarantees the lease agreements for our corporate headquarters provide for residual value guarantees 
the fair value of a residual value guarantee in lease agreements entered into after december   must be recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
as such  we recognized million and million in liabilities  related to the extended east and west towers and almaden tower leases  respectively 
these liabilities are recorded in other long term liabilities with the offsetting entry recorded as prepaid rent in other assets 
the balance will be amortized to our consolidated statements of income over the life of the leases 
as of december  and december   the unamortized portion of the fair value of the residual value guarantees  for both leases  remaining in other long term liabilities and prepaid rent was million and million  respectively 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and from time to time  we are subject to claims by our customers under these indemnification provisions 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our directors and officers for certain events or occurrences while the director or officer is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the director s or officer s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency risk foreign currency hedging instruments in countries outside the us  we transact business in us dollars and various other currencies which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
additionally  we may use foreign exchange option or forward contracts to hedge our euro  yen  or british pound denominated revenue 
our revenue exposures for fiscal  and were as follows in millions  except yen fiscal fiscal fiscal euro yen in billions british pounds 
table of contents our european operating expenses are primarily in euro and our japanese operating expenses are primarily in yen  which naturally mitigates a portion of the exposure related to our euro and yen denominated product revenue 
we then hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with purchased option contracts and or forward contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to help mitigate the impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
in addition  we hedge our net monetary assets and liabilities using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
as of december   the total absolute value of outstanding contracts was  million which included the notional equivalent of million in euro  million in yen and million in other foreign currencies 
these hedges are foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and purchased put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through june the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk  we only contract with counterparties who meet our minimum requirements under our counterparty risk assessment process 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition  we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
as of december  and december   this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time  we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro  yen  and british pound 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net on our consolidated statements of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended december   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as interest and other income  net 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries  revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 

table of contents we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine to change our hedging program 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our hedging activities 
interest rate risk short term investments and fixed income securities at december   we had debt securities classified as short term investments of  million
