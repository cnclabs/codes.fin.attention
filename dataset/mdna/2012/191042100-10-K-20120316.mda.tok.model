the strong increase in citizens band radio sales reflected strong sales of the new patented lx le  which has a revolutionary new design and new features for the professional driver  as well as the positive effect of an improving economy on truck shipments and discretionary spending by professional drivers at travel centers 
the increase in ceel sales was due to strong sales of radar detectors into russia and the united arab emirates 
partially offsetting these increases was a percent decline in sales of radar detection domestically  due mainly to a combination of two less models at a major retailer and  for several major retailers  a shift in purchases to lower priced models or an overall reduction in spending on the category because of the negative effect of high unemployment on discretionary spending by cost conscious consumers 
cobra s gross profit increased million in to million from million  while gross margin improved to percent from percent  in the improvement in gross margin was due to gross margin increases in the domestic business and at ceel

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company refinanced its bank debt in july and replaced a million revolving asset based facility and a million term loan with a million revolving asset based facility 
this credit agreement provided a lower cost credit facility and greater liquidity due to the borrowing base formula 
refer to note financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
on september   the company amended the credit agreement to increase borrowings available under the revolving credit facility from million to million due to the increase in consolidated working capital needs 
working capital requirements are seasonal  with demand for working capital being higher later in the year as customers begin purchasing for the holiday selling season 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and from borrowings under its credit agreement will be sufficient in to fund its working capital needs 
at december   the company had interest bearing debt outstanding of million and availability was approximately million under the revolving credit line based on the borrowing base formula 
additionally  the company s credit agreement permits an overadvance of up to million dollars for sixty consecutive days 
absent a waiver from lenders  a failure to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement could result in any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement becoming immediately due and payable and the inability to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement 
the company was in compliance with the credit agreement covenants for the twelve month period ending december  net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  totaled  compared to the million of net cash provided by operating activities in significant net cash inflows from operations and non cash add backs included net earnings of million  depreciation and amortization totaling million and increase in payables and accrued liabilities of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a million increase in inventory  a million increase in receivables and a million increase in non current assets 
million of the depreciation and amortization related to the cobra segment in included million of intangible asset amortization   of fixed asset depreciation  and  of prepaid amortization  mainly for packaging and outside design 
for the ppl segment  depreciation and amortization amounted to million in and included  of amortization for intangibles and other assets  which resulted from the allocation of the purchase price  and  of fixed asset depreciation 
the increase in payables and accrued liabilities was due to higher income taxes  management incentive expenses  and higher marketing and promotional expenses 
the company paid million in third quarter of for custom duties that were accrued in the second quarter of due to the cumulative adjustment for the incorrect duty rate used for detection products in the prior five years 
the increase in inventories was mainly due to higher safety stocks that resulted from higher sales levels and an earlier chinese new year  which was expected to delay first quarter vendor production schedules 
higher receivables were due to the increased level of sales in the fourth quarter of as compared to the prior year s fourth quarter 
the increase in non current assets was due to additions of product software  trademarks  patents and computer software 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in capital expenditures  mainly building and leasehold improvements and tooling  totaled million while life insurance premiums totaled  net cash provided by financing activities in totaled  as a result of additional bank borrowings

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions 
the accounting policies and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described in the policies for sales returns reserve 
the company bundles aura database subscriptions with certain detection and navigation products and sells these products to customers in transactions accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
the revenue associated with the sale of the aura database is deferred and recognized into income over the applicable subscription period  while the revenue associated with the detection and navigation products is recognized at the date of sale 
sales returns reserve 
the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reduction in accounts receivable and increases in inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 

table of contents warranty reserve 
the company provides a warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales and the unit standard cost of each model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in its estimate  as historical experience indicates that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical return rates and how the returned product will be disposed of by  either liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 
liquidation reserve 
the company maintains a liquidation reserve representing the write down of returned product from our customers to its net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for partial credit against similar  new models  this decision depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to the vendor  taking into consideration the liquidation prices expected to be received and the amount of vendor credit 
the amount of the reserve is determined by comparing the cost of each unit returned to the estimated amount to be realized upon each unit s disposition  either from returning the unit to the vendor for credit towards the cost of new  similar product or liquidating the unit 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 
net realizable value reserve 
the company maintains a net realizable value reserve to write down below cost  as necessary  certain inventory not previously sold to customers where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included in the reserve and the estimated net realizable value of such model ie  the per unit price that it is estimated can be received in the marketplace if the model was sold 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
advertising and sales promotion accrual 
the advertising and sales promotion accrual reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  generally agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary quarter to quarter depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of its planned program sales  negotiate changes to the term of the existing programs or add new ones  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in such customer s programs 
periodic adjustments may also be necessary for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation 
obligations under the deferred compensation plans which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the discount rate for and was percent 
the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future performance 
the company maintains life insurance policies for certain current and former executives to provide funding for future obligations 
software related to products to be sold 
the company purchases and or incurs costs in connection with the development of software to be used in products that the company intends to sell 
coding and related costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established and a working model of the product developed are capitalized and deferred as intangible assets 
capitalized costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the 
table of contents estimated product life cycle or on a straight line basis  whichever is greater 
software related intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date for possible impairment 
if such review indicates that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value 
intangible assets 
the company evaluates intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or if impairment indicators exist 
if impairment indicators exist for an amortizable intangible asset  the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets  no impairment charge is recorded 
if the projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the intangible asset to its fair value 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws for each applicable tax jurisdiction 
the deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year and the effect of enacted tax rate changes 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the company operates  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning and strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
due to the operating results for  the expected continuation of a global recession and the absence of tax planning strategies to generate a sufficient level of taxable income  management concluded the full realization of the deferred tax assets within a reasonable time horizon did not satisfy the more likely than not realization criteria 
accordingly  the company established a full deferred tax valuation allowance for its us operation in the valuation allowance is a non cash charge that does not preclude the company from fully realizing the net deferred tax assets in the future 
at december  the deferred tax valuation allowance totaled million 
the financial statement benefit of a tax position is recognized only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation when repatriated to on the united states 
prior to  the company asserted under asc formerly apb that the unremitted earnings of its irish subsidiary ceel were permanently invested 
in  the company withdrew its permanent investment assertion for ceel s future earnings and provided deferred taxes on the earnings subsequent to in light of the company s debt refinancing concluded in  the company reassessed its unremitted earnings position in the fourth quarter of and concluded all of ceel s earnings including the period were permanently invested overseas 
accordingly the deferred tax liability recorded as of december  was reversed but there was no income statement impact because of the valuation allowance

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange risks and interest rates are inherent to the company s operations 
changes to these factors could cause fluctuations in the company s net earnings  cash flows and the fair values of financial instruments subject to market risks 
the company identifies these risks and when appropriate mitigates the financial impact with hedging and interest rate swaps 
debt incurred under a revolving loan agreement with a balance of million as of december  is priced at an interest rate that floats with the market 
therefore  the fair value of this debt is not significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market 
a basis point movement in the floating debt rate would result in approximately a  increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows 
the company s suppliers are located in china  hong kong and south korea 
the company historically has negotiated substantially all of its purchases in us dollars and occasionally uses forward contracts to purchase dollars at a fixed exchange rate to the british pound sterling or a fixed exchange rate to the euro 
the company considers opportunities to make purchases in other currencies to the extent that doing so would be advantageous in light of currency fluctuations involving the us dollar and other currencies 
in  approximately percent of the company s sales were outside the united states  principally in europe and canada  compared to percent in future fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect operating results 
the company minimizes the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with relationships outside of the united states by conducting nearly all of its transactions in us dollars  except for some billings of its european business  which are conducted in euros and the billings of ppl which are primarily in british pound sterling 
the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  forward contracts are used occasionally for hedging a portion of the company s british pound and euro denominated transactions
