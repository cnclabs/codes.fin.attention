item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the information described under the caption risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and supplier of premium diagnostics products  medical imaging systems and surgical products dedicated to serving the healthcare needs of women 
our core business units are focused on breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical  and skeletal health 
on august   we completed our acquisition of gen probe 
gen probe is a leader in molecular diagnostics products and services that are used primarily to diagnose human diseases  screen donated human blood  and test transplant compatibility 
gen probe is part of our diagnostics business segment 
our breast health products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories  including digital and film based mammography systems  mri  breast coils  cad  for mammography and mri  minimally invasive breast biopsy devices  breast biopsy site markers  breast biopsy guidance systems  breast imaging comfort pads  and breast brachytherapy products 
our most advanced breast imaging platform  dimensions  utilizes a new technology called tomosynthesis to produce d images  as well as conventional d full field digital mammography images 
in the us  our dimensions product was approved in december by the fda for providing conventional d images 
in february  we received approval from the fda to enable the d tomosynthesis capability of our dimensions system 
in november  we announced the commercial release of our c view synthesized d image reconstruction algorithm that eliminates the need for a conventional d mammogram as a component of a d mammography exam 
c view software is approved for sale throughout the european economic area and in other countries recognizing the ce mark 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we submitted a pre market approval application to the fda for this capability 
we offer a wide range of diagnostic products which are used primarily to aid in the diagnosis of human diseases and screen donated human blood 
our molecular diagnostics products include our aptima family of assays our proprietary invader chemistry and advanced instrumentation panther  tigris and hta 
the aptima family of assays is used to detect the common stds chlamydia and gonorrhea  certain high risk strains of hpv  and trichomonas vaginalis  the parasite that causes trichomoniasis 
our invader chemistry comprises molecular diagnostic reagents used for a variety of dna and rna analysis applications  including cervista hpv hr  and cervista hpv products to assist in the diagnosis of hpv  as well as other products to diagnose cystic fibrosis  cardiovascular risk and other diseases 
in december  we announced the fda approved our cervista hta system for use with our cervista hpv hr test 
the cervista hta system automates the dna extraction and detection steps of the cervista hpv hr test 
this product was launched in january our diagnostics products also include the thinprep system  which is primarily used in cytology applications such as cervical cancer screening  and the rapid fetal fibronectin test  which assists physicians in assessing the risk of pre term birth

these blood screening products are marketed worldwide by our blood screening collaborator  novartis  under novartis trademarks 
our gyn surgical products include our novasure system  and myosure system 
the novasure system involves a minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding 
the myosure system is a tissue removal device that is designed to provide incision less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus 
at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to cease manufacturing  marketing and selling our adiana system determining that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
our skeletal health products include dual energy x ray bone densitometry systems  an ultrasound based osteoporosis assessment product  and our fluoroscan mini c arm imaging products 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to we  us  hologic or our company refer to hologic  inc and each of its consolidated subsidiaries 
recent developments on august   we completed our acquisition of gen probe 
such acquisition  and the significant indebtedness we incurred to fund that acquisition  subject us to risks and uncertainties are described herein  including those set forth under the caption risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
market acceptance of our medical products in the united states and other countries is dependent upon the purchasing and procurement practices of our customers  patient demand for our products and procedures and the reimbursement of patients medical expenses by government healthcare programs  private insurers or other healthcare payors 
in the united states  the centers for medicare medicaid services  known as cms  establish coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare providers treating medicare and medicaid beneficiaries 
under current cms policies  varying reimbursement levels have been established for our 
table of contents products and treatments 
coverage and reimbursement policies and rates applicable to patients with private insurance are dependent upon individual private payor decisions which may not follow the policies and rates established by cms 
the use of our products and treatments outside the united states is similarly affected by coverage and reimbursement policies adopted by foreign governments and private insurance carriers 
cms has not adopted a reimbursement rate for the use of d tomosynthesis  as tomosynthesis was only recently approved by the fda in february in connection with our pre market approval  or pma  application for our dimensions system 
we are working with governmental authorities  healthcare providers  insurance companies and other third party payors in our efforts to secure reimbursement for the use of d tomosynthesis 
however  we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful 
failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  adequate reimbursement for the use of d tomosynthesis would adversely affect sales of our dimensions d systems 
the continuing uncertainty surrounding worldwide financial markets and macroeconomic conditions has caused and may continue to cause the purchasers of medical equipment to decrease or delay their medical equipment purchasing and procurement activities 
additionally  volatility in world credit markets has caused and continues to cause our customers to experience difficulty securing the financing necessary to purchase our products 
economic uncertainty and unemployment have and may continue to result in cost conscious consumers focusing on acute care rather than wellness  which has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our products and procedures 
furthermore  governments and other third party payors around the world facing tightening budgets could move to further reduce the reimbursement rates or the scope of coverage offered  which could adversely affect sales of our products 
if the current adverse macroeconomic conditions continue  our business and prospects may be negatively impacted 
in march  significant reforms to the healthcare system were adopted as law in the united states 
the law includes provisions that  among other things  reduce and or limit medicare reimbursement  require all individuals to have health insurance with limited exceptions and imposes new and or increased taxes 
specifically  the law requires the medical device industry to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a excise tax on united states sales of certain medical devices effective january  we expect that all of our products will fall under the government classification requiring the excise tax 
product sales in the united states represented and of our worldwide net product sales for the years ended september  and september   respectively 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and other governmental actions may adversely affect our business  operations or financial condition  including  without limitation new laws  regulations or judicial decisions  or new interpretations of existing laws  regulations or decisions  related to healthcare availability  methods of delivery and payment for health care products and services  changes in the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes that may delay or prevent the approval of new products and result in lost market opportunity  changes in fda and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring  labeling changes  restrictions on product distribution or use  or other measures after the introduction of our products to market  which could increase our costs of doing business  adversely affect the future permitted uses of approved products  or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products and treatments  new laws  regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices  and changes in the tax laws relating to our operations  including those associated with the recently adopted healthcare reform law discussed above 
professional societies  government agencies  practice management groups  private health science foundations  and organizations involved in healthcare issues may publish guidelines  recommendations or studies to the healthcare and patient communities from time to time 
recommendations of government agencies or these other groups organizations may relate to such matters as usage  cost effectiveness  and use of related preventative services and treatments therapies 
recommendations  guidelines or studies that are followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products 
for example  in november  the american congress of obstetrics and gynecologists  known as the acog  released updates in which they have recommended less frequent cervical cancer screening similar to guidelines released by acog in november and guidelines released in march by the us preventative services task force  known as the uspstf  and the american cancer society 
however  the uspstf recommendations now also include hpv co testing for certain patient populations  an update from their draft guidelines in october over the last few years  there have been periodic significant fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the ongoing fluctuations of the value of the us dollar  including the recent strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  may cause our products to be less competitive in international markets and may impact sales and profitability over time 
historically  a majority of our capital equipment sales to international dealers were denominated in us dollars 
however  more sales are now denominated in the euro compared to the us dollar for our euro zone dealers 
in addition  we have international sales  principally in our diagnostics segment  that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the value of these sales is also impacted by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty in the worldwide financial markets  foreign currency fluctuations may be significant in the future  and if the us dollar continues to strengthen  we may experience a material adverse effect on our international revenues and operating results 

table of contents acquisitions fiscal acquisitions gen probe incorporated on august   we completed the acquisition of gen probe and acquired all of the outstanding shares of gen probe 
pursuant to the merger agreement  each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the acquisition was cancelled and converted into the right to receive in cash 
in addition  all outstanding restricted shares  restricted stock units  performance shares  and those stock options granted prior to february  were cancelled and converted into the right to receive per share in cash less the applicable exercise price  as applicable 
stock options granted after february  were cancelled and converted into stock options to acquire shares of hologic common stock determined by a conversion formula defined in the merger agreement 
the total purchase price was billion  which was funded through available cash and financing consisting of senior secured credit facilities and senior notes resulting in aggregate proceeds of billion  net of discounts 
gen probe  headquartered in san diego  california  is a leader in molecular diagnostics products and services that are used primarily to diagnose human diseases  screen donated human blood  and test transplant compatibility 
we expect this acquisition to enhance our molecular diagnostics franchise and to complement our existing portfolio of diagnostics products 
gen probe s results of operations are reported within our diagnostics reporting segment from the date of acquisition 
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of august  we are continuing to obtain information to complete our valuation of intangible assets  as well as to determine the acquired assets and liabilities  including tax assets and liabilities 
the purchase price has been allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on management s estimate of their fair values 
certain of gen probe s assets have been designated as assets held for sale and recorded at fair value less the estimated cost to sell such assets 
these represent non core assets to the company s business plan and are expected to be sold within one year of the acquisition 
as part of the purchase price allocation  the company has determined the identifiable intangible assets are developed technology of billion  in process research and development of million  customer contracts of million  and trade names of million 
the fair value of the intangible assets has been estimated using the income approach  specifically the excess earning method and relief from royalty method  and the cash flow projections were discounted using rates ranging from to 
the cash flows are based on estimates used to price the transaction  and the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return from the transaction model and the weighted average cost of capital 
the developed technology assets comprise know how  patents and technologies embedded in gen probe s products and relate to currently marketed products and related instrument automation 
in valuing the developed technology assets consideration was only given to products that have received regulatory approval 
in process research and development projects relate to in process projects that have not reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and have no alternative future use 
the primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying product  which primarily pertains to receiving approval to perform certain diagnostic testing on gen probe s instrumentation  such as the panther and tigris systems 
the company recorded million of in process research and development projects related to six projects 
one project  valued at million  received fda approval in october the other projects are expected to be completed within the next months to months with a total estimated cost of approximately million to complete such projects 
given the uncertainties inherent with product development and introduction  we cannot assure that any of our product development efforts will be successful  completed on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
all of the in process research and development assets were valued using the multiple period excess earnings method approach using a discount rate of 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets and intangible assets acquired of billion was recorded to goodwill 
the factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill are based on several strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the gen probe acquisition 
these benefits include the expectation that the combined company s complementary products in the molecular diagnostics market with gen probe s fully automated product franchise will significantly broaden the company s offering in women s health and diagnostics 
the combined company should benefit from a broader global presence and with hologic s direct sales force and marketing in europe and its investment in china distribution  the growth prospects of gen probe s products are expected to be enhanced significantly 
the combined company anticipates significant cross selling opportunities within the diagnostics market through hologic s larger channel coverage and physician sales team 
none of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents gen probe s revenue and pre tax loss from continuing operations for the period from the acquisition date to september  were million and million  respectively 
fiscal acquisitions tct international co  ltd 
on june   we acquired tct international co  ltd 
tct  a privately held distributor of medical products  including our thinprep pap test  related instruments and other diagnostic and surgical products 
tct s operating subsidiaries are located in beijing  china 
our acquisition of tct enabled us to obtain an established nationwide sales organization and customer support infrastructure in china as we execute on our strategy to expand internationally 
the purchase price was million 
in addition  the majority of the former shareholders of tct may receive two annual contingent earn out payments subject to adjustment not to exceed million less a deferred payment of million  which was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of tct  which are primarily reported within our diagnostics reporting segment and to a lesser extent within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
the allocation of the purchase price was based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of june  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of customer relationships of million  business licenses of million and trade names of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million was allocated to goodwill 
the contingent earn out payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth for the one year periods beginning january  and january  as compared to the respective prior year periods  and are payable after the first and second anniversaries from the date of acquisition  respectively 
since these payments are contingent on future employment  they are being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the required service periods  the first and second year anniversaries from the date of acquisition 
based on actual and projected revenues for the tct business  we recorded compensation expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the first earn out period was completed in the third quarter of fiscal and we paid million in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of september   we had accrued million for the second contingent earn out payment 
interlace medical  inc on january   we acquired interlace medical  inc interlace  a privately held company located in framingham  massachusetts 
interlace is the developer  manufacturer and supplier of myosure 
the purchase price was comprised of million in cash  which was net of certain adjustments  plus two annual contingent payments up to a maximum of an additional million in cash 
subsequent to the acquisition date  our results of operations include the results of interlace  which has been integrated within our gyn surgical reporting segment 
the allocation of the purchase price was based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of january  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets comprised of developed technology of million and trade names of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million was allocated to goodwill 
the agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of a portion of legal expenses in defense of the interlace intellectual property 
we have the right to collect certain amounts set aside in escrow from the initial consideration and  as applicable  offset contingent consideration payments of qualifying legal costs 
the contingent payments are based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during a two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
pursuant to asc  business combinations  we recorded this liability at its estimated fair value based on future revenue projections of the interlace business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
as of the date of acquisition  these cash flow projections were discounted using a rate of  based on the weighted average cost of capital of the acquired business plus a credit risk premium for non performance risk related to the liability pursuant to asc this analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of million  which is being adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in the fair value of the liability due to the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones 
this fair 
table of contents value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level measurement as defined in asc during the second quarter of fiscal  the first measurement period lapsed resulting in a total contingent consideration amount recorded for this period of million  which was disbursed to the former shareholders of interlace net of amounts withheld for certain legal indemnification purposes 
we recorded charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability 
as of september   we had accrued million for the second measurement period contingent payment 
beijing healthcome technology company  ltd 
on july   we completed our acquisition of beijing healthcome technology company  ltd 
healthcome  a privately held manufacturer of medical equipment  including mammography equipment  located in beijing  china 
healthcome develops and manufactures analog mammography products targeted to lower tier hospital segments in china 
subsequent to the acquisition  we worked to integrate our selenium detector technology into the healthcome mammography system  and on december   we received sfda approval in china for our serenity digital mammography system 
we began selling this product in china in the second quarter of fiscal  and intend to commercialize it throughout asia and potentially other emerging markets in the future 
the purchase price was million in cash 
in addition  we were obligated to make future payments to the shareholders  who remain employed  up to an additional million over three years 
since these payments were contingent on future employment  they were being recognized as compensation expense ratably over the respective service periods 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we and the former shareholders agreed that the former shareholders would terminate their employment 
we agreed to pay the majority of the contingent consideration in accordance with the original payment terms 
as a result  we accelerated the unearned compensation in the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded compensation expense of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal acquisitions sentinelle medical inc on august   we acquired sentinelle medical inc sentinelle medical  a privately held company located in toronto  canada 
the purchase price was comprised of an million cash payment  which was net of certain adjustments  plus three contingent payments over a two year period up to a maximum of an additional million in cash 
sentinelle medical results are reported within our breast health reporting segment 
the allocation of the purchase price was based upon estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of august  the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired was allocated to identifiable intangible assets aggregating million  primarily comprised of developed technology of million and in process research and development projects of million  based upon a detailed valuation that relies on projections and assumptions 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of million was allocated to goodwill 
the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value of in process projects based on risk adjusted cash flows utilizing a discount rate of 
these in process projects had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition and had no future alternative uses 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects was obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products 
we received fda approval for both projects in fiscal the contingent payments were based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
pursuant to asc  we recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability based on future revenue projections of the sentinelle medical business under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
this analysis resulted in an initial contingent consideration liability of million  which was adjusted periodically as a component of operating expenses based on changes in fair value of the liability driven by the accretion of the liability for the time value of money and changes in the assumptions pertaining to the achievement of the defined revenue growth milestones 
this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level measurement as defined in asc quarterly  we re evaluated our assumptions and updated the revenue and probability assumptions for future earn out periods and lowered our projections 
as a result of these adjustments  we recorded a reversal of expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to record the contingent consideration liability at fair value 
the first two earn out periods were completed and paid prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the third earn out period ended in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have accrued payment of million for this final payment as of september

years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  breast health product revenues increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in our breast biopsy products revenue of million as a result of an increase in the number of eviva and celero biopsy devices sold in the united states 
in addition  our digital mammography systems revenue increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily attributable to an increase in the number of units sold of both of our d and d dimensions products worldwide  partially offset by slightly lower average selling prices internationally in the current year 
partially offsetting the increase in revenues from the 
table of contents dimensions systems was a decrease in the number of selenia systems sold worldwide  and to a lesser extent  a slight deterioration of average selling prices  and a continued shift in selenia product mix and configuration differences 
we are selling more selenia performance models  which have fewer features than our base selenia model  which is a full featured model  and carry lower average selling prices 
in addition  we sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems  and average selling prices are lower in our international markets compared to the domestic market 
we expect the shift in sales from our selenia products to our dimensions products to continue 
we also had an additional million in revenue in fiscal from our new trident product 
diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which contributed million in revenue  and an increase of million in thinprep pap tests revenue 
the thinprep increase was principally from an increase in the sales price of thinprep in china as well as higher volumes from the inclusion of revenues of tct our former distributor in that country acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of thinprep pap tests sold in other international markets  partially offset by a decline in domestic units sold 
the inclusion of gen probe s results is partially impacted by the novartis collaboration 
pursuant to the collaboration  a portion of gen probe s revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis  however  gen probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment 
as a result  amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and are not recorded as revenue in our results of operations 
in fiscal  this contingent revenue of million was not recognized in our results of operations 
we also experienced growth in our legacy molecular diagnostics products  which contributed a revenue increase of million in fiscal as we continue to gain new customer accounts and unit sales to existing customers and increase our international sales through tct 
in addition  in fiscal  we sold more diagnostics instruments internationally  increasing revenue by million 
revenues also increased slightly due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal was a week year compared to fiscal  which was a week year 
gyn surgical product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of the myosure system  which contributed an increase of million of revenue in fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in novasure devices revenue of million in fiscal in addition  revenues also increased slightly due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal while we experienced an increase in the number of novasure devices sold internationally  these increases were more than offset by a decline in the number of novasure devices sold domestically  and lower average selling prices driven by product mix and more international sales 
we believe the decline in the number of novasure devices sold in the united states is primarily attributable to the continuing effect of unemployment and economic uncertainty  which has resulted in patients delaying surgery or opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives 
in addition  adiana system revenues declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal the reduction in adiana system revenues was due to our decision to cease manufacturing  marketing and selling the product as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  determining it was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
skeletal health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase of million of our mini c arm systems as a result of our new insight system introduced in  and an increase of million in osteoporosis assessment product sales internationally 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our digital mammography systems  which are no longer under warranty  and an extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets product sales gross margin decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as discussed below 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased in gyn surgical and diagnostics  declined slightly in breast health and remained relatively flat in skeletal health compared to fiscal resulting in an overall lower gross margin rate in fiscal compared to fiscal the gyn surgical gross margin rate in fiscal declined primarily due to charges of million related to our decision to shut down our adiana product line 
on april   we announced that we were ceasing to manufacture  market and sell the adiana system  determining that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future 
the charge related to the write off of inventory  manufacturing equipment and equipment at customer sites  and contractual purchase orders for which there was no expected future use of the materials and components 
in addition  lower sales of the novasure system resulted in a lower gross margin rate  which was partially offset by the shift of sales to our myosure system compared to lower margin adiana system sales 
for additional information pertaining to the adiana product line discontinuance charges  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the diagnostics gross margin rate in fiscal declined compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe results  which included million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting  higher service costs and depreciation of equipment at customer sites  and distribution costs 
gen probe s gross margin since acquisition was lower than its historical gross margin rate due to the purchase accounting effect on our collaboration agreement with novartis in our blood screening business 
based on the novartis collaboration terms  a portion of gen probe s revenue is contingent on donations testing revenue earned by novartis  however  gen probe recognizes the full product cost upon shipment 
as a result  amounts to be received for this contingent revenue related to inventory on hand and not yet utilized by novartis customers as of the acquisition date were recorded as unbilled accounts receivable on the balance sheet in purchase accounting and are not recorded as revenue in our results of operations 
in fiscal  this contingent revenue of million was not recognized in our results of operations 
partially offsetting these cost increases were higher thinprep pap test volumes resulting in lower fixed overhead costs per unit  favorable manufacturing variances  and the increase in sales price in china attributable to our acquisition of tct 
in fiscal  breast health s gross margin rate increased slightly compared to fiscal the gross margin rate for our digital mammography systems increased due to higher sales of our d dimensions systems  which have higher average selling prices and gross margins than our selenia systems  and an increase in d tomosynthesis software upgrades 
partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in selenia performance systems sales as a percent of total selenia system sales compared to the prior year 
our selenia performance systems have lower gross margins than our full featured selenia systems 
we also sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems where average selling prices are lower compared to the domestic market 
also offsetting the overall increase in breast health s gross margin was the sales mix within our breast biopsy products as we sold more eviva disposables and less atec disposables as a percentage of revenue compared to the prior year 
eviva disposables have a lower gross margin than our atec disposables because they have a higher manufacturing cost and carry additional royalty charges 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology and patents 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the inclusion of technology assets acquired in our gen probe acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal and from our interlace acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  there was an increase in amortization expense due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal amortization was also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin decreased due to additional expenses incurred related to international expansion  which has resulted in the hiring of additional service personnel  increasing compensation and travel costs worldwide 
in addition  service costs have increased in our diagnostics segment due to an increase in our installed base of thinprep processors and imagers 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments impairment of goodwill gain on sale of intellectual property  net litigation settlement charges  net acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of gen probe  which accounted for million of additional expenses 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in compensation and benefits due to lower bonus expenses  and a reduction in clinical trials and regulatory costs  which was primarily a result of the status and timing of projects 
research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials 
at any point in time  we have a number of different research projects and clinical trials being conducted and the timing of these projects and related costs can vary period to period 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of gen probe  which accounted for million of additional expense  and the inclusion of tct for a full year  an increase in the number of sales personnel in the gyn surgical business segment  an increase in compensation and benefits and higher commissions  continuing product launch activities related to our d dimensions product  and higher travel expenses 
these expenses were also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal was partially offset by lower expenditures for our direct to consumer advertising campaign for novasure 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to higher acquisition related transaction costs associated with the gen probe acquisition of million  additional expenses  including retention costs  from the inclusion of gen probe of million  integration and consulting costs related to the gen probe acquisition  an increase in bad debt expense internationally  charges for an ongoing state sales tax audit  an increase in the nonqualified deferred compensation plan  or dcp  liability  which is driven by the underlying market changes of hypothetical investments  and higher invoice collection fees from higher credit card payments 
these expenses were also higher due to 
table of contents the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by an overall decrease in compensation and benefits due to lower bonus expense and lower stock compensation expense as higher valued restricted stock units fully vested in fiscal and lower depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships  trade names  business licenses and non compete agreements related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the addition of intangible assets from the gen probe acquisition  a full year of amortization from the interlace and tct acquisitions  and an increase in amortization due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in fiscal amortization was also higher due to the extra week in fiscal compared to fiscal contingent consideration compensation expense 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  excluding gen probe  we are obligated to make contingent earn out payments 
amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment

contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
in connection with our acquisitions of sentinelle medical and interlace  we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent on achieving certain revenue based milestones 
as of each respective acquisition date  we recorded contingent consideration liabilities for the estimated fair value of the amount we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business 
this liability is not contingent on future employment and is based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
at each reporting period  we re measure the fair value of these liabilities and record the changes in fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from accretion of the liability for the passage of time  changes in discount rates  and changes in the timing  probabilities and amount of revenue estimates 
in fiscal  we recorded a net charge of million reflecting an increase in the fair value of the interlace liability of million due to higher revenue estimates  partially offset by a benefit of million related to sentinelle medical due to actual revenues being less than those estimated 
we recorded a net benefit of million in fiscal reflecting a net decrease in the fair values of these liabilities comprised of a reduction in the fair value of the sentinelle medical liability of million due primarily to changes in revenue assumptions offset by a charge of million related to interlace based primarily on the accretion of the liability to the expected payment amount

provision for income taxes 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount provision for income taxes 
table of contents our effective tax rate for fiscal was of pre tax losses compared to of pre tax earnings in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was significantly impacted by non deductible contingent consideration compensation expense  nondeductible acquisition costs  a nondeductible goodwill impairment charge  and a net increase in income tax reserves and valuation allowances on certain foreign losses 
the unfavorable tax impact of these items was partially offset by the domestic manufacturing benefit and a loss claimed related to the discontinuance of the adiana product line 
the effect of these permanent items to the effective tax rate was magnified by the current year pre tax loss 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was less than the statutory rate primarily due to reversing income tax reserves  the domestic manufacturing benefit and us and canadian research and development tax credits 
the million income tax reserve reversal was due to us favorably settling our us federal income tax audit for fiscal years through and statutes of limitations expiring in several state and foreign jurisdictions 
segment results of operations we report our business as four segments breast health  diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
we measure segment performance based on total revenues and operating income or loss 
revenues from product sales of each of these segments are described in further detail above 
the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of total revenues and the primary changes in operating income or loss by segment 
breast health 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income operating income as a of segment revenue breast health revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in product revenue of million discussed above and a million increase in service revenues 
operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in operating expenses partially offset by an increase in gross margin on an absolute dollar basis as a result of increased revenues discussed above 
in fiscal  the overall gross margin rate increased to from in fiscal due primarily to improvements in product gross margin discussed above 
the product gross margin rate increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal operating expenses were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the net benefit of million recorded in the prior year compared to the million benefit in the current year to adjust the sentinelle medical contingent consideration liability to fair value  higher contingent compensation expense of million related to healthcome in fiscal  the mammosite goodwill impairment charge of million  and restructuring charges of million primarily related to our decision to close our facility in indianapolis 
in addition  expenses were higher in the current year due to higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel  continuing product launch activities related to our d dimensions product  medical education  travel  and litigation settlements and related expenses  partially offset by lower clinical trial expenses 
diagnostics 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating loss income operating loss income as a of segment revenue diagnostics revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
operating income for this business segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the net gain of million on the sale of makena intellectual property to kv in the second quarter of fiscal compared to a net gain of million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal for a scheduled payment received under the amended agreement 
the balance of the decrease in fiscal of million was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase in gross margin in 
table of contents absolute dollars 
while gross margin in absolute dollars increased  the gross margin rate declined to in fiscal compared to in fiscal as discussed above 
operating expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of tct for a full year  which included an increase in contingent consideration compensation expense of million  the inclusion of million of operating expenses for gen probe excluding restructuring charges and integration and retention costs  acquisition transaction and integration costs of approximately million related to the gen probe transaction  and restructuring charges of million related to the consolidation of our diagnostics business as a result of the gen probe acquisition 
we also experienced higher expenses related to trade shows  higher compensation costs related to hiring additional personnel and annual salary increases  travel  and higher bad debt charges  primarily related to one international customer 
gyn surgical 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating loss income operating loss income as a of segment revenue gyn surgical revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
this business segment incurred an operating loss in fiscal compared to income in fiscal primarily attributable to the inclusion of interlace s operations acquired in the second quarter of fiscal  which included a charge of million in fiscal to adjust the contingent consideration liability to fair value compared to aggregate contingent consideration charges of million in fiscal  and the aggregate charge of million related to the adiana product line discontinuance 
overall  gross margin in absolute dollars decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the adiana product line charge recorded in cost of product sales of million  and higher intangible asset amortization expense of million  partially offset by the impact of higher sales as discussed above 
this resulted in the segment s gross margin rate declining to in fiscal from in fiscal in addition  this segment incurred higher operating expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in sales and marketing related to higher compensation and benefits for additional sales personnel  annual salary increases and commissions  and higher travel  an in process research and development charge of million  higher intangible asset amortization expenses  additional expenditures for ongoing research and development projects and charges related to an ongoing state sales tax audit 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in advertising expenditures for our novasure system s direct to consumer advertising campaign and lower marketing and medical education expenses related to the discontinuance of the adiana product line 
skeletal health 
years ended september  september  change amount amount amount total revenues operating income operating income as a of segment revenue skeletal health revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in product sales discussed above 
operating income increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in revenues and improvement in gross margin rates to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement in gross margin dollars was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and travel expenses 

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount product sales breast health diagnostics gyn surgical skeletal health in fiscal  our product sales increased million  or  compared to fiscal due to an increase in revenues of million from breast health  million from gyn surgical  million from diagnostics  and million from skeletal health 
breast health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to growth in our breast biopsy products of million  the inclusion of a full year of revenues from sentinelle medical acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased million  and a favorable foreign currency impact of million 
the increase in breast biopsy products revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of eviva biopsy devices sold with the largest increase in the us overall  our digital mammography systems revenues decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal we experienced a decrease in the number of selenia systems sold worldwide  and to a lesser extent  selenia product mix and configuration differences resulted in lower revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal we sold a greater number of our selenia value related models and a lesser amount of our full featured selenia models in fiscal our value related models have lower average selling prices than our full featured selenia models 
in addition  we sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems and average selling prices are lower in our international markets compared to the domestic market 
mostly offsetting these decreases was an increase in the number of units sold of our new d d dimensions products as these systems continue to gain traction 
these systems also have higher average selling prices than our selenia systems 
diagnostics product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenues from our cervista hpv tests  the inclusion of tct acquired in the third quarter of fiscal resulting in incremental revenues of approximately million  a favorable foreign currency impact of million and to a lesser extent an increase in the number of thinprep pap tests sold internationally  partially offset by a reduction in domestic sales 
cervista hpv revenues have increased as we continue to gain new customer accounts and unit sales to existing customers increase 
we believe the decline in the number of thinprep pap tests sold domestically was due to the decline in patient visits year over year attributable to the lagging effects of unemployment  continuing economic uncertainty  recent changes in cervical cancer screening guidelines to extend the recommended intervals between such screenings  and to a lesser extent laboratory consolidation 
gyn surgical product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in the number of adiana systems sold and the inclusion of myosure system sales acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 
novasure system sales were essentially flat year over year 
while we experienced an increase in the number of novasure devices sold internationally and to a lesser extent a slight increase in average selling prices  these increases were offset by a decline in the number of novasure devices sold domestically 
we believe the decline in units sold domestically was primarily due to the lagging effects of unemployment and continuing economic uncertainty  which has resulted in patients delaying surgery and opting for lower cost and generally less effective alternatives 
skeletal health product sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in osteoporosis assessment product sales worldwide 
offsetting this increase in fiscal was a reduction in mini c arm revenues of million due to a decrease in the number of units sold domestically and slightly lower average selling prices in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
in fiscal  of product sales were generated in the united states  in europe  in asia pacific  and in other international markets 
service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount service and other revenues service and other revenues are primarily comprised of revenue generated from our field service organization to provide ongoing service  installation and repair of our products 
service and other revenues increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily in our breast health business due to an increase in the number of service contracts driven by an increase in our installed base of our digital mammography systems  which were no longer under warranty 

table of contents cost of product sales 
years ended september  september  change amount of product sales amount of product sales amount cost of product sales cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets product sales gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the significant intangible asset charge of million recorded in fiscal related to mammosite 
cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal  cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenues increased in breast health compared to fiscal and was relatively flat in diagnostics  gyn surgical and skeletal health compared to fiscal the decline in breast health gross margin in fiscal was primarily due to million of additional costs related to the sale of acquired sentinelle medical inventory written up to fair value in purchase accounting  unfavorable absorption and higher production spend principally in the digital mammography product lines  and a mix shift in sales of our selenia product line 
our selenia value related models have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our full featured selenia models 
in addition  we sold more selenia systems internationally as a percentage of total selenia systems  where our average selling prices are lower 
partially offsetting these decreases were higher sales of dimensions d and d tomosynthesis software upgrades 
the dimensions d product has a higher average selling price and gross margin compared to our full featured selenia models 
within our breast biopsy products  the mix of products sold resulted in lower gross margins as we sold more eviva disposables and less atec disposables as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal eviva disposables have a lower gross margin than our atec disposables because they have a higher manufacturing cost and carry additional royalty charges 
cost of product sales amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets relates to acquired developed technology 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
the increase in amortization expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of additional amortization expense related to the technology assets acquired from the sentinelle medical and interlace acquisitions in the fourth quarter of fiscal and second quarter of fiscal  respectively 
in addition  there was an increase in amortization expense in fiscal due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal offsetting this increase was a decline in amortization expense in fiscal related to our mammosite reporting unit 
we recorded an impairment charge for the mammosite developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as discussed below  which resulted in a reduced asset value and lower future amortization expense 
cost of product sales impairment of intangible assets 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we identified indicators of impairment in our mammosite reporting unit due to changing market conditions for the breast brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes from the continuing adverse macroeconomic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in lowering our financial projections for mammosite 
we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets  which indicated that these cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which are primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million to developed technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal for additional information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 

table of contents cost of service and other revenues 
years ended september  september  change amount of service and other revenues amount of service and other revenues amount cost of service and other revenues service and other revenues gross margin improved to in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the improved absorption of fixed service costs and the continued growth of service contract revenue  primarily in the breast health business 
we were able to convert a high percentage of our domestic installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon the expiration of the warranty period 
in addition  warranty costs decreased due to lower failure rates in certain of our products 
operating expenses 
years ended september  september  change amount of total revenue amount of total revenue amount operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments impairment of goodwill impairment of intangible assets gain on sale of intellectual property  net litigation settlement charges  net acquired in process research and development restructuring and divestiture charges  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of additional expenses from sentinelle medical acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal and interlace acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 
in fiscal  compensation and benefits increased due to an increase in headcount  annual salary increases  and higher bonuses based on improved company performance compared to the prior year 
in addition  there was an increase in clinical trials and research projects spend primarily attributable to next generation novasure and adiana products  partially offset by a reduction in clinical trial and project spend on the dimensions d tomosynthesis product  which was approved by the fda in february research and development primarily reflects spending on new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical research and trials 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of sentinelle medical  interlace and tct  expenditures for our direct to consumer advertising campaign for the novasure system  higher spending for other marketing and advertising initiatives including the dimensions d product launch  increased compensation and benefits related to an increase in headcount  annual salary increases and higher bonuses based on improved company performance compared to the prior year  and medical education 
partially offsetting these increases were lower distributor and third party commissions 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to additional expenses from the inclusion of sentinelle medical  interlace and tct  an increase in compensation and benefits primarily due to an increase in headcount  annual salary increases  higher bonuses due to improved company performance compared to the prior year  and additional expenses related to consummating our acquisitions and integrating them into our operations  including accounting and tax services 
in fiscal  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in litigation costs due to lower activity compared to fiscal  in which a number of matters were resolved  primarily the ethicon lawsuit 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets results from customer relationships  trade names  business licenses and non compete agreements related to our acquisitions 
these intangible assets are generally amortized over their estimated useful lives of between and years using a straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be consumed 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the addition of intangible assets from the sentinelle medical  interlace and tct acquisitions  and an increase in amortization due to the method of recognition based on the expected economic benefits of the underlying assets  primarily related to the intangible assets acquired in the cytyc merger in the first quarter of fiscal contingent consideration compensation expense 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  we are obligated to make contingent earn out payments 
amounts recorded in this financial statement line item are those contingent payments that are contingent on future employment 
these payments are also generally based on achieving certain performance milestones  typically incremental revenue growth  as is the case for tct 
the amounts recorded related to interlace and healthcome are solely related to continuing employment 
in fiscal  we recorded an aggregate charge of million comprised of million  million and million related to tct  interlace and healthcome  respectively 
for additional information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisitions of sentinelle medical and interlace  we recorded an estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for each acquisition as required by us generally accepted accounting principles 
this liability is not contingent on future employment and is based on future revenue projections of the respective businesses under various potential scenarios and weighted probability assumptions of these outcomes 
this analysis is updated quarterly and changes to the fair value of this liability are recorded in the statements of operations 
as a result  we recorded a net benefit of million in fiscal reflecting a net decrease in the fair values of these liabilities comprised of a reduction in the fair value of the sentinelle medical liability of million due primarily to changes in revenue assumptions offset by a charge of million related to interlace based primarily on the accretion of the liability to the expected payment amount

impairment of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with performing our company wide annual budgeting and forecasting process  we determined that there were indicators of impairment related to our mammosite reporting unit  and we recorded intangible asset impairment charges discussed above and below 
the fair value of this reporting unit declined from fiscal primarily due to our reassessment of the overall market size of breast brachytherapy and a reduction in long term growth projections 
after determining the fair values of mammosite s long lived assets  other than goodwill  and writing these assets down to their fair values  we performed the step goodwill impairment test for mammosite 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
no other reporting units were deemed to be impaired in fiscal for additional information  refer to note intangible assets and goodwill to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
impairment of intangible assets

operating expenses remained relatively flat 
liquidity and capital resources at september   we had million of working capital  and our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by million during fiscal due to funds used for the gen probe acquisition 
table of contents and other investing activities primarily related to payments for contingent consideration  capital expenditures and placement of equipment under customer usage agreements 
during fiscal  our sources of funds included our borrowings of billion to fund a portion of the purchase price for gen probe  cash generated from operations and net proceeds from stock option exercises

these adjustments to net loss were partially offset by a decrease in net deferred tax liabilities of million  primarily the result of recapturing taxes from the debt extinguishment and amortization of intangible assets  and the gain on sale of intellectual property of million 
cash provided by operations included a net cash inflow of million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities were driven primarily by a reduction of prepaid expenses and other current assets of million principally due to receiving tax withholding amounts recorded in gen probe s opening balance sheet in purchase accounting related to the pay off of restricted stock units and shares and acceleration of stock options in connection with the gen probe acquisition 
in addition  deferred revenue increased million as we continue to convert our increasing installed base of digital mammography systems to service contracts upon expiration of the warranty period  and we received net cash of million from an income tax receivable acquired from gen probe 
partially offsetting these cash inflows was a decrease in accrued expenses of million  primarily due to payments of taxes withheld from equity awards in connection with the gen probe acquisition  income taxes  and contingent consideration recorded as compensation expense  partially offset by compensation related accruals and interest on our debt 
in addition  inventory increased million primarily due to an increase in components on hand to support higher sales volume  the introduction of new products and last time buys  and accounts receivable increased million primarily due to higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we used billion of cash for investing activities 
this use of cash was primarily attributable to our purchase of gen probe utilizing billion  net of cash acquired 
cash used in investing also related to million for purchases of property and equipment  which consisted primarily of the placement of equipment and instruments under customer usage agreements and manufacturing equipment and computer hardware  the payment of contingent consideration to the former shareholders of adiana of million  an increase in restricted cash of million related to an international customer deposit  and the acquisition of in process research and development assets of million 
partially offsetting these uses of cash was the receipt of million for a scheduled payment under our amended agreement in which we sold the rights to our makena intellectual property to kv 
in fiscal  our financing activities provided us net cash of billion  primarily reflecting our borrowings of billion to fund our gen probe acquisition  which was comprised of billion of net proceeds under our credit agreement and billion under our senior notes  which are described below  and cash proceeds from employee stock plans of million 
these financing proceeds were partially offset by payments for debt issuance costs of million related to the credit agreement  senior notes and notes  contingent consideration of million related to our interlace and sentinelle acquisitions  deferred payments to the tct shareholders of million  and million for employee related taxes withheld for the net share settlement of vested restricted stock units

contingent earn out payments 
in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we have incurred the obligation to make contingent earn out payments tied to performance criteria  principally revenue growth of the acquired businesses over a specified period 
in certain circumstances  such as a change of control  a portion of these obligations may be accelerated 
in addition  contractual provisions relating to these contingent earn out obligations may include covenants to operate the acquired businesses in a manner that may not otherwise be most advantageous to us 
these provisions may also result in the risk of litigation relating to the calculation of the amount due or our operation of the acquired business 
such litigation could be expensive and divert management attention and resources 
our obligation to make contingent payments may also result in significant operating expenses 
depending upon the particular facts and circumstances giving rise to the payment and our previous estimates  all or a portion of these payments may be required to be expensed by us when accrued 
for example  our contingent earn out obligations payable in connection with the tct acquisition will be fully expensed as accrued because our obligation to make these payments is conditioned on the continued employment of certain key employees of tct 

table of contents our contingent consideration arrangements are recorded as either additional purchase price or compensation expense if continuing employment is required to receive such payments 
pursuant to asc  contingent consideration that is deemed to be part of the purchase price is recorded as a liability based on the estimated fair value of the consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired business as of the acquisition date 
this liability is re measured each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations 
increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities can result from accretion of the liability for the passage of time  changes in discount rates  and changes in the timing  probabilities and amount of revenue estimates 
contingent consideration arrangements from acquisitions completed prior to the adoption of asc effective in fiscal for us that are deemed to be part of the purchase price of the acquisition are not subject to the fair value measurement requirements of asc and are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of adiana  inc  we have an obligation to the former adiana shareholders to make contingent payments tied to the achievement of milestones 
the milestone payments include potential contingent payments of up to million based on worldwide sales of the adiana permanent contraception system in the first year following fda approval and on annual incremental sales growth thereafter through december  fda approval of the adiana system occurred on july   and we began accruing contingent consideration in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the defined percentage of worldwide sales of the product 
since this contingent consideration obligation arose from an acquisition prior to the adoption of asc  the amounts accrued are recorded as additional purchase price to goodwill 
the purchase agreement includes an indemnification provision that provides for the reimbursement of qualifying legal expenses and liabilities associated with legal claims against the adiana products and intellectual property  and we have the right to offset contingent consideration payments to the adiana shareholders with these qualifying legal costs 
we made payments of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to the former adiana shareholders  net of amounts withheld for the legal indemnification provision 
we had been in litigation with conceptus regarding certain intellectual property matters related to the adiana system  and to the extent available  we have been recording legal fees related to the conceptus litigation matter as a reduction to the accrued contingent consideration payments 
no contingent consideration was earned and recorded in fiscal  and as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal the company decided to discontinue the manufacture  marketing and sales of the adiana system 
on october   the jury returned a verdict in the conceptus litigation matter see below in favor of conceptus awarding damages in the amount of million 
on april   the company entered into a license and settlement agreement with conceptus in which conceptus agreed to forgo the million jury award in consideration of the company agreeing to a permanent injunction against the manufacture  sale and distribution of the adiana product 
at september   the company has accrued million for the payment of contingent consideration to the former adiana shareholders  which is net of amounts withheld for qualifying legal costs 
as a result of our decision to discontinue sales of the adiana product in the second quarter of fiscal  on account of our determination that the product was not financially viable and would not become so in the foreseeable future  we do not expect to incur any further contingent payment obligations to the former adiana shareholders 
we also have contingent consideration obligations related to our sentinelle medical  interlace  tct and healthcome acquisitions 
pursuant to asc  contingent consideration pertaining to sentinelle medical and interlace is required to be recorded as a liability at fair value and the adjustments to fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
contingent consideration pertaining to tct and healthcome is contingent upon future employment and is being recorded as compensation expense as it is earned over the respective service periods 
for additional information pertaining to the acquisitions  contingent consideration terms and the assumptions used to fair value contingent consideration  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
a summary of amounts recorded to the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal and fiscal are as follows statement of operations line item september  sentinelle medical interlace tct healthcome total contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments statement of operations line item september  sentinelle medical interlace tct healthcome total contingent consideration compensation expense contingent consideration fair value adjustments 
table of contents in connection with our acquisition of sentinelle medical  we have an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two year period of up to a maximum of million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
we made payments of million and million in the first quarter of fiscal and the third quarter of fiscal  respectively 
at september   this liability was recorded at million 
in connection with our acquisition of interlace  we have an obligation to the former stockholders to make contingent payments over a two year period up to a maximum payout of million based on a multiple of incremental revenue growth during the two year period following the completion of the acquisition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the first measurement period lapsed resulting in a total contingent amount recorded for this period of million  which was disbursed to the former shareholders of interlace  net of amounts withheld for certain legal indemnification purposes 
at september   this liability was recorded at million 
under the sale and purchase agreement for tct  million of the purchase price has been deferred for one year from the date of the acquisition 
this amount plus a portion of the working capital adjustment of million were paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal an additional million working capital adjustment payment is due upon the completion of fiscal in addition  we have an obligation to certain of the former shareholders  based on future employment  to make contingent payments over a two year period not to exceed million less the deferred payment of million 
the first earn out payment of million was made in the fourth quarter of fiscal at september   we have accrued million for the second contingent earn out payment 
in connection with our acquisition of healthcome  we have an obligation to the former shareholders to make contingent payments of million over the next two fiscal years 
at september   we have accrued million for these contingent payments

the amounts in the table do not include deferred tax liabilities for the recapture of the original issuance discount 
see convertible notes above 
the financing leases represent two leases for an office building and a manufacturing facility  which were required to be recorded on our balance sheet under us gaap

amounts represent those recorded in accrued expenses and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
see contingent earn out payments for a more complete description of our contingent earn out obligations 

table of contents purchase obligations primarily represent minimum purchase commitments for inventory and instruments  and to a lesser extent  other operating expense commitments 
in addition to the minimum payments due under our collaborative agreements included above  we may be required to pay up to million in milestone payments  plus royalties on net sales of any products using specified technology 
amounts represent minimum royalties due on net sales of products incorporating licensed technology and subject to a minimum annual royalty payment 
pension obligations do not include our obligation under our deferred compensation plans of million  which is recorded as a current liability 
deferred compensation plan benefits are generally paid out at retirement or termination of employment 
the above table does not reflect our long term liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions recorded under fin codified primarily in asc  income taxes totaling million 
due to the complexity associated with tax uncertainties  we cannot reasonably make a reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle these non current liabilities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for more information on our unrecognized tax benefits 
in addition  certain of our cost method equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies  we have not included these future potential payments in the table above 
future liquidity considerations we expect to continue to review and evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies  and strategic alliances that we believe will complement our current or future business 
subject to the risk factors set forth in part i  item a of this annual report and the general disclaimers set forth in our special note regarding forward looking statements at the outset of this annual report  we believe that cash flow from operations and the cash available under our revolving facility will provide us with sufficient funds in order to fund our expected normal operations  debt payments  including interest  and contingent consideration obligations over the next twelve months 
our longer term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  repayment of debt  contingent consideration obligations  acquisitions or other investments  or to repay our convertible notes and related deferred tax liabilities 
as described above  we have significant indebtedness outstanding under our credit agreement  senior notes and convertible notes 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under the above referenced risk factors elsewhere in this report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also adversely affect our long term liquidity 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and claims 
in connection with these legal proceedings and claims  management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement  if any  of these proceedings 
these estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential litigation outcomes and settlement strategies 
in accordance with asc  contingencies  loss contingencies are accrued if  in the opinion of management  an adverse outcome is probable and such outcome can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  valuations  purchase price allocations and contingent consideration related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  warranty reserves  certain accrued expenses  restructuring and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of what we believe to be the more significant critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
as a developer and manufacturer of high technology medical equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures on products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product expiration or end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  excess or obsolete  we would be required to record impairment charges within cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although considerable effort is made to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or expected usage could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
accounts receivable reserves we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  including a dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  and evaluation of the customer s current financial situation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information present 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and our assessment of the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  for example as a result of the ongoing financial and economic uncertainty or otherwise  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular orders  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
as a result of our adoption of asc in fiscal  contingent consideration  which is not deemed to be linked to continuing employment  is recorded at fair value as measured on the date of acquisition 
the value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections under various potential scenarios  which are generally probability weighted as to the outcome of each scenario 
these cash flow projections are discounted with an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
quarterly until such contingent amounts are earned  the fair value of the liability is reassessed at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment and actual results are likely to differ from the amounts originally recorded 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management  which consider management s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
as a result of our adoption of asc  we capitalize these assets and record them in our consolidated balance sheet 
under asc  in process research and development assets are evaluated for impairment similar to goodwill and once the project is complete  if at all  the asset is amortized over its remaining useful life 
prior to the adoption of asc  we expensed the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole and impairments may result 

table of contents we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we have also used the income approach  as described above  to determine the estimated fair value of certain other identifiable intangible assets including developed technology  customer relationships and contracts  and trade names 
developed technology represents patented and unpatented technology and know how 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional products and services 
trade names represent acquired company and product names 
for business licenses  we use a combination of the lost profits method and replacement cost method to value such assets 
business licenses allow us to conduct business in a certain country  namely china 
with respect to property  plant and equipment  we estimate the fair value of these assets using a combination of the cost and market approaches  depending on the component 
generally  we apply the cost approach as the primary method in estimating the fair value of land and buildings as the market approach is less reliable based on potential significant differences between the property being valued and the potentially comparable sales of similar properties 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed 
the economic pattern is based on undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with the company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit  which is included in the breast health reportable segment 
the impairment indicators were due to a reduction in our revenue projections and long term growth rates as a result of the continuing deterioration of the brachytherapy market and competition from existing technologies 
our cash flow estimates were based upon historical cash flows  as well as future projected cash flows derived from the company wide annual planning process 
the analysis indicated that mammosite s long lived assets were recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the predominant long lived asset 
we believe that our procedures for estimating future cash flows were reasonable and consistent with market conditions at the measurement date 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our company wide annual budgeting and strategic planning process  we determined that indicators of impairment existed in our mammosite reporting unit  due to changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
these factors resulted in us lowering the financial projections for mammosite 
as a result  we performed the first step in the long lived assets impairment test pursuant to asc and compared mammosite s forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its net assets 
these undiscounted cash flows were insufficient to recover mammosite s carrying value 
therefore  we determined the fair value of mammosite s long lived assets  which are primarily intangible assets  using a discounted cash flow technique 
the expected future cash flows are level inputs under asc and are those expected to be generated by the market participants  discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate 
based on the fair value of the long lived assets  we recorded an aggregate impairment charge of million to write these intangible assets down to their fair value 
the charge was comprised of 
table of contents million related to developed technology  which was recorded in cost of product sales  million related to customer relationships and million related to trade names  which were recorded in impairment of intangible assets 
in addition  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million see below for further discussion 
goodwill we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the reporting unit s carrying value to its fair value 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales and ratio comparisons of similar companies 
we base the discount rate on the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  of market participants 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the second step requires us to perform a hypothetical purchase allocation as of the measurement date and estimate the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets 
the fair value of intangible assets is determined as described above and is subject to significant judgment 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized discounted cash flow  or dcf  and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions 
we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date 
as a result of completing step  all of our reporting units  except mammosite  had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
mammosite s fair value has declined from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in our revenue projections and long term growth rates 
the changes in mammosite s financial projections were a result of the continuing deterioration of the brachytherapy market  and competition from existing technologies 
we performed the step analysis for mammosite  consistent with the procedures described above  and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge  resulting in no remaining goodwill for this reporting unit 
for our other reporting units  if their respective fair values had been lower by  each reporting unit would have still passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
since  the fair value of our reporting units was determined by use of the dcf  and the key assumptions that drive the fair value in this model are the wacc  terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  significant judgment is applied in determining fair value 
if the current economic environment were to deteriorate  this would likely result in a higher wacc because market participants would require a higher rate of return 
in the dcf as the wacc increases  the fair value decreases 
the other significant factor in the dcf is our projected financial information ie  amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates and if these assumptions were to be adversely impacted  this could result in a reduction of the fair value of this reporting unit 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf in making our impairment test conclusions 
we believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows  market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date 
as a result of completing step  all of the reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required 
for illustrative purposes  had the fair value of each reporting unit been lower by  each reporting unit would have still passed step of the goodwill impairment test 
we conducted our fiscal annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter 
we utilized dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of june   and believe we used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue  cost projections  cash flows and market multiples as of the measurement date 
as a result of completing step  all of the company s reporting units  except mammosite  had fair values exceeding their carrying values  and as such  step of the impairment test was not required for these reporting units 
mammosite s fair value has declined from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in its long term growth rates 
the changes in mammosite s financial projections were a result of changing market conditions for the brachytherapy market  including downward pressure on procedure volumes due to the continuing adverse economic environment and current trends in breast cancer management  as well as competitive pricing pressures and competition from existing and alternative new technologies 
the dcf calculation of fair value was positively impacted by a reduction in the discount rate to from used in the fiscal annual impairment test 

table of contents we performed the step analysis for mammosite  consistent with the procedures described above  and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
for illustrative purposes had the fair value of mammosite been lower  the charge would have been higher by million 
if the fair value of the company s other reporting units had been lower by  one reporting unit would have failed step requiring a step analysis 
this reporting unit is in the breast health reportable segment and had a fair value at the annual impairment measurement date that exceeded its carrying value by with goodwill of million 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined by use of the dcf 
at september   for our other reporting units with goodwill aggregating billion as of september   we believed that these reporting units were not at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of products  primarily medical imaging systems and diagnostic and surgical disposable products  and related services  which are primarily support and maintenance services on our medical imaging systems 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  there are no uncertainties regarding acceptance  the sales price is fixed or determinable  no right of return exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  our product arrangements for capital equipment sales  primarily in our breast health and skeletal health reporting segments  are multiple element arrangements  including services  such as installation and training  and multiple products 
in accordance with asc  based on the terms and conditions of the product arrangements  we believe that these services and undelivered products can be accounted for separately from the delivered product element as our delivered products have value to our customers on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  revenue for services not yet performed at the time of product shipment are deferred and recognized as such services are performed 
the relative selling price of any undelivered products is also deferred at the time of shipment and recognized as revenue when these products are delivered 
there is no customer right of return in our sales agreements 
service revenues primarily consist of amounts recorded under service and maintenance contracts and repairs not covered under warranty  installation and training  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
service and maintenance contract revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
other service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we record revenue as separate units of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control 
some of our products have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
we determined that except for our cad products  the software element in our other products is incidental in accordance with the software revenue recognition rules and are not within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules  asc  software revenue recognition 
we determined that given the significance of the software component s functionality to our cad systems  which are sold by our breast health segment  these products are within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
we evaluated the appropriate revenue recognition treatment of our other hardware products  including our dimensions digital mammography systems  which have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality ie  it is a tangible product  and determined they are not within the scope of asc we are required to allocate revenue to multiple element arrangements based on the relative fair value of each element s selling price 
we typically determine the selling price of our products based on our best estimate of selling price  referred to as esp  and services based on vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  referred to as vsoe 
we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold on a stand alone basis 
in determining vsoe  our policy requires a substantial majority of selling prices for a product or service to be within a reasonably narrow range 
we also consider the class of customer  method of distribution  and the geographies into which our products and services are sold when determining vsoe 
we typically have had vsoe for our products and services 
if vsoe cannot be established  which may occur in instances when a product or service has not been sold separately  stand alone sales are too infrequent  or product pricing is not within a narrow range  we attempt to establish the selling price based on third party evidence of selling price  referred to as tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
when we cannot determine vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would typically transact a stand alone sale of the product or service 
esp is determined by considering a number of factors including our pricing policies  internal costs and gross margin objectives  method of distribution  information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  market research and information  recent technological trends  competitive landscape and geographies 

table of contents for those arrangements accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules  asc generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on their relative vsoe of fair value 
if vsoe does not exist for a delivered element  the residual method is applied in which the arrangement consideration is allocated to the undelivered elements based on their vsoe with the remaining consideration recognized as revenue for the delivered elements 
for multiple element software arrangements where vsoe of fair value of post contract customer support  referred to as pcs  has been established  we recognize revenue using the residual method at the time all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
as part of our diagnostics reporting segment and as a result of the gen probe acquisition  we manufacture blood screening products according to demand schedules provided by our collaboration partner  novartis 
our agreement provides that we share a portion of novartis s revenue from screening blood donations 
upon shipment to novartis  we recognize blood screening product sales at an agreed upon fixed transfer price  which is not refundable  and record the related cost of products sold 
based on the terms of our collaboration agreement with novartis  our ultimate share of the net revenue from sales to the end user in excess of the transfer price revenues recognized is not known until it is reported to us by novartis 
on a monthly basis  novartis reports net revenue generated during the prior month and remits an additional corresponding net payment to us which we record as revenue at that time 
this payment combined with the transfer price revenues previously recognized represents our ultimate share of net revenue under the agreement 
within our diagnostics business  and to a lesser extent  our surgical business  we provide our instrumentation for example  the thinprep processor  thinprep imaging system  panther and tigris and certain other hardware to customers without requiring them to purchase the equipment or enter into a lease 
instead  we recover the cost of providing the instrumentation and equipment in the amount it charges for its diagnostic tests and assays and other disposables 
customers enter into a customer usage agreement  and we install the equipment at customer sites and customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable products at a stated price over a defined contract term  which is typically between three and five years 
revenue is recognized over the term of the customer usage agreement as tests  assays and other disposable products are shipped 
the depreciation costs associated with an instrument are charged to cost of product sales on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the instrument 
the costs to maintain these instruments in the field are charged to cost of product sales as incurred 
we sell our instruments to novartis for use in blood screening and record these instrument sales upon delivery since novartis is responsible for the placement  maintenance and repair of the units with its customers 
we also sell instruments to our clinical diagnostics customers and record sales of these instruments upon delivery and customer acceptance 
for certain customers with non standard payment terms  instrument sales are recorded based upon expected cash collection 
prior to delivery  each instrument is tested to meet the company s specifications and the specifications of the fda  and is shipped fully assembled 
customer acceptance of the company s clinical diagnostic instrument systems requires installation and training by our technical service personnel 
installation is a standard process consisting principally of uncrating  calibrating and testing the instrumentation 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with the fair value of stock options and restricted stock units issued to our employees 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we use a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of stock options including the advice of an outside valuation advisor and the advisor s model 
the model requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently use a combination of historical and implied volatility  which is weighted based on a number of factors 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc  stock compensation  requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
based on an analysis of historical forfeitures  we have determined a specific forfeiture rate for certain employee groups and have applied forfeiture rates ranging from to as of september  depending on the specific employee group 
this analysis is re evaluated periodically and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 

table of contents we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense for employee equity awards in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was due to the addition of assumed stock options in the gen probe acquisition  which included the acceleration of vesting for certain terminated employees  resulting in million of additional stock based compensation expense 
as of september   there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock units  respectively  that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have recognized net deferred tax liabilities of billion at september  and million at september  the liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and the debt discount and original issuance discount on our convertible notes 
the tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  stock based compensation  and research credits 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  excluding interest  of million as of september  and million as of september  at september   million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of the company s effective tax rate 
in the next twelve months  it is reasonably possible that we will reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by to million due to expiration of statute of limitations and favorable settlements with taxing authorities  all of which would reduce our effective tax rate 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
asu amended asc  balance sheet  to converge the presentation of offsetting assets and liabilities between us gaap and ifrs 
asu requires that entities disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after january   which is our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which requires an entity to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu does not change any of the components of comprehensive income  but it eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity 
asu is effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal and should be applied retrospectively 
we have elected to early adopt asu in fiscal and have provided a separate statement of comprehensive income loss in our consolidated financial statements 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in may  the fasb issued asu no 
fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and 
table of contents ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for us in our second quarter of fiscal and should be applied prospectively 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu requires a public entity to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior year 
it also requires a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported revenue and earnings 
the new disclosure was effective for our first quarter of fiscal and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
intangibles goodwill and other in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
asu is effective for us in fiscal the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step impairment test is required  otherwise  no further testing is required 
asu is effective for us beginning in fiscal  although early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe that asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  accounts receivable  cost method equity investments  insurance contracts and related nonqualified deferred compensation plan liability  accounts payable and debt obligations 
except for our outstanding convertible notes  the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
as of september   we have billion of principal of convertible notes outstanding  which are comprised of our notes with a principal of million  our notes with a principal of million  and our notes with a principal of million 
the convertible notes are recorded net of the unamortized discount on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of our notes  notes and notes as of september  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
amounts outstanding under our credit agreement aggregating billion aggregate principal are subject to variable rates of interest based on current market rates  and as such  we believe the carrying amount of these obligations approximates fair value 
in addition  based on the recent issuance of our senior notes  we believe their carrying amount approximates fair value 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposure is in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we incur interest expense on borrowing outstanding under our convertible notes  senior notes and credit agreement 
the convertible notes and senior notes have fixed interest rates 
borrowings under our credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum  at our option  initially  with respect to all loans made under term loan a i at the base rate plus per annum  or ii at the adjusted eurodollar rate ie  the libor rate plus  and with respect to loans made under term loan b i at the base rate  with a floor of  plus  or ii at the adjusted eurodollar rate  with a floor of plus as of september   there was billion of aggregate principal outstanding under the credit agreement comprised of billion under term loan a and billion under term loan b 
since these debt obligations are variable rate instruments  our interest expense associated with these instruments is subject to change 
a adverse movement increase in libor rate would increase annual interest expense by less than million due to the low current interest rate environment and the floor on our term loan b 
the return from cash and cash equivalents will vary as short term interest rates change 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates  however  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk 
our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we conduct business worldwide and maintain sales and service offices outside the united states as well as manufacturing facilities in costa rica  germany  canada and china 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies  except at our costa rica subsidiary  where the majority of the business is conducted in us dollars 
our international sales are denominated in a number of currencies  primarily the euro and us dollar 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of goods and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in the euro are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the euro 
our expenses  denominated in euros  are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens against the euro and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred net foreign exchange gains losses of million  million and million  respectively
