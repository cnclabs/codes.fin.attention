item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe these policies are critical because they require management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the end of a period and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
due to the complexity of these critical accounting policies  our accounting methods relating to these policies involve substantial use of estimates 
estimates are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on assumptions  including assumptions about future events 
our estimates may not include assumptions that reflect very positive or very negative market conditions and  accordingly  our actual results could differ significantly from those generated by our estimates 
as a result  the estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements  as well as our estimates of our future results of operations  may be significantly inaccurate 
unidentified or other control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results and could have a material adverse effect on our operations  investor confidence in our business and the trading prices of our securities 
internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations 
internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures 
internal control over financial reporting can also be circumvented by collusion or improper management override 
because of such limitations  there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting 
a failure to remain current in our filings may have material impacts on our business and liquidity 
if we are not able to remain current in our filings with the sec  we will face several adverse consequences 
table of contents and restrictions 
we will not be able to have a registration statement under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  covering a public offering of securities  declared effective by the sec  or make offerings pursuant to existing registration statements  we will not be able to make an offering to any purchasers not qualifying as accredited investors under certain private placement rules of the sec under regulation d  we will not be eligible to use a short form registration statement on form s for a period of at least months after the time we become current in our periodic and current reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  we will not be able to deliver the requisite annual report and proxy statement to our stockholders to hold our annual stockholders meeting  our employees cannot be granted stock options  nor will they be able to exercise stock options registered on form s  because form s would not be available to us  and our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
these restrictions may impair our ability to raise funds in the public markets  should we desire to do so  and to attract and retain employees 
in addition  pursuant to the registration rights agreement between us and the holders of our series a preferred stock  if our registration statement ceases to be available to the holders of our series a preferred stock  a registration default occurs 
if we are not able to cure this registration default in a timely manner we are obligated to pay the holders of the series a preferred stock percent per annum of the original liquidation preference of the series a preferred stock  accruing from the date of the registration default until the registration default is cured 
future changes in technology or market conditions could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets  including goodwill  resulting in additional non cash charges that could significantly impact our operating results 
our balance sheet includes significant intangible assets  including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
our ability to accurately predict future cash flows related to these intangible assets may be adversely affected by unforeseen and uncontrollable events 
in the highly competitive medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions that adversely affect the competitiveness of our products 
we test our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year  but we also test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at any time when there is a change in circumstances that indicates that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
any future determination that these assets have a carrying value that is greater than their fair value could result in substantial non cash impairment charges  which could significantly impact our reported operating results 
delaware law and provisions in our charter could make the acquisition of our company by another company more difficult  which could adversely affect our stock price 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of our company 
this could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws allow us to issue preferred stock without any vote or further action by the stockholders  to eliminate the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  to specify advance notice and other procedures for director nominations by stockholders and submission of other proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings  and to eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors 
certain provisions of delaware law applicable to us could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us  including section  which prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years unless certain conditions are met 
the procedures required for director nominations and stockholder proposals and delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  including without limitation  discouraging a proxy contest or making more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
these provisions of delaware law  our certificate of incorporation  and our bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the company  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 

table of contents one equity partners  a private equity firm  may have influence on our major corporate decisions 
as previously reported  on september   an affiliate of one equity partners  or oep a private equity firm  acquired our series a preferred stock 
see part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in our form k for a description of this transaction 
as a result of this transaction  oep became the largest beneficial owner of our stock 
at this time  assuming conversion of the series a preferred stock to our common stock  including make whole amounts as defined in the certificate of designation for the series a preferred stock but excluding outstanding options and warrants held by other parties  oep would represent an ownership interest of approximately percent of our voting stock 
in connection with this transaction  we expanded the board of directors to eight members and granted oep the right to nominate two directors 
effective september   messrs 
gregory belinfanti and christian ahrens  both partners of oep  were appointed to our board of directors 
consequently  oep may have the ability to influence our board of directors and matters requiring stockholder approval  subject to the restrictions placed on oep by the securities purchase agreement  including without limitation oep s agreement to vote for any director nominated by the board and to comply with the terms of the standstill 
since september   oep is free to convert the series a preferred stock into our common stock and  subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws  dispose of such stock  which could result in a decrease of the market price of our common stock  particularly if such dispositions are made in the open market and are substantial 
we are dependent upon key management  technical personnel and advisors  and loss of our key personnel and advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the loss of the services of one or more key employees or consultants could have a material adverse effect on us 
our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management and technical personnel 
we face intense competition for qualified personnel  any of whom often receive competing employment offers 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to attract and retain such personnel 
loss of key personnel could materially impact our ability to meet our financial and operational objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations 
factors may make the market price of our stock highly volatile 
in our experience  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
adverse fluctuations due to these factors may adversely affect our level of revenues and profitability  results of operations  financial condition  and future growth prospects in the short and long term the introduction of new product lines and 
table of contents increased penetration in existing applications  achievement of research and development milestones  the amount and timing of expenditures and the receipt and recognition of license fees  and timing of the receipt of orders and product shipments  absence of a backlog of orders  and the rate of product returns 
as a result of fluctuations in our operating results or other factors  the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future 
investors may be unable to resell our common stock at or above their purchase price 
this volatility may subject our stock price to material fluctuations due to the factors discussed in this risk factors section  and other factors including market reaction to acquisitions and trends in sales  marketing  and research and development  rumors or dissemination of false information  changes in coverage or earnings estimates by analysts  our ability to meet analysts or market expectations  and sales of common stock by existing stockholders 
as previously reported  as of september   oep owns all of our outstanding series a preferred stock 
since september   oep may convert the series a preferred stock into our common stock and  subject to the registration requirements of the federal securities laws  dispose of such stock  which could result in a decrease of the market price of our common stock  particularly if such dispositions are made in the open market and are substantial 
circumstances associated with our integration of acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results 
an element of our growth strategy in the future may be the pursuit of acquisitions of other businesses that expand or complement our existing products and distribution channels 
integrating businesses  however  involves a number of special risks  including the possibility that management attention may be diverted from regular business concerns by the need to integrate operations  unforeseen costs  difficulties and liabilities in integrating our and the acquired company s employees  operations and systems  accounting  regulatory  or compliance issues that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of the acquired company  challenges in retaining our customers or the customers of the acquired company following the acquisition  the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services  and impairment charges if our acquisitions are not successful due to these risks 
in addition  we may finance future acquisitions by issuing equity securities  which may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders 
if we are unable to successfully complete and integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner  our business  financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected

overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures and markets surgical products  many of which are based on our minimally invasive patented coblation technology 
our products are used across several medical specialties  improving many existing soft tissue surgical procedures and enabling new minimally invasive surgical procedures 
our business consists of one operating and reportable segment for the development  manufacturing and marketing of disposable devices and implants for select surgical procedures 
the product development  manufacturing and other supporting functions  such as regulatory affairs and distribution  are common across our company 
we organize and manage our sales and marketing functions according to both the surgical procedure that typically employ our products and geography 
most of the company s products are used in sports medicine or ent procedures 
key financial items  trends and uncertainties affecting our business our management reviews and analyzes several metrics and ratios in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our operating performance 
the most important of these financial metrics and ratios include product sales growth our principal source of revenue is from sales of our products  which primarily include disposable surgical devices and implants 
product sales are made through our employed sales representatives  independent sales agents and distributors 
reported product sales in included the recognition of million of product sales that had been previously deferred pending the outcome of certain contract matters 
excluding the effects of the deferred revenue recognized in  product sales growth in   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we anticipate that disposable surgical device sales and implant sales will remain key components of our product sales for the foreseeable future 
we contract manufacture disposable surgical devices and implants based on our technologies for other medical devices companies which is included in product sales 
product sales from contract manufacturing for the years ended december   and product sales were million  million and million  respectively 
we also generate revenue from royalties and fees from licensing of our products and technology to other companies and earn other revenues from shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
gross product margin gross product margin as a percentage of product sales in   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively 
cost of product sales consists of all product manufacturing costs including material costs  labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty and other direct product costs  adjustments to the carrying value of inventory for excess or obsolete items  certain stock based compensation costs associated with manufacturing and operations personnel and costs of product shipped to our customers 
cost of product sales also includes the amortization of controller units and instruments that have been placed at customer locations to enable the use of our disposable surgical products 
we maintain ownership of all placed controllers and instruments and the costs are amortized into cost of product sales over their estimated useful life 
our manufactured products are produced at our costa rica facility 
raw materials used to produce our products are generally not subject to substantial commodity price volatility 
the comparability of gross product margin between periods will be impacted by several items  including the mix between proprietary and contract manufactured product sales  the stability of our average sales price on proprietary products  changes in the estimated percentage of engineering activities related to manufacturing process design or improvement  and  changes in our product emphasis which could result in excess and obsolescence charges being included in the cost of product sales in a particular period 

table of contents operating margin operating margin is our income from operations as a percentage of total revenues 
our key operating expenses include expenses incurred in connection with research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative activities  as well as the amortization of intangible assets 
operating margin for  and was negative percent  percent and percent  respectively 
under the short term incentive plan for approved by our board of directors  adjusted operating margin is a key metric for purposes of evaluating management s performance 
adjusted operating margin is operating margin adjusted for investigation and restatement related costs 
investigation and restatement related costs were percent  percent and percent of total revenue for  and respectively  and adjusted operating margin was percent  percent and percent for these same periods 
adjusted operating margin is a non gaap measure of profitability and it should not be considered as a substitute for operating margin  or other measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
in the fourth quarter of we accrued as part of investigation and restatement related costs million as a result of a proposed settlement of the private securities class actions  as noted in item legal proceedings 
in april  we entered into a new lease agreement for facilities located in austin  texas with the intent to relocate the activities conducted at our sunnyvale  california facility to austin  texas 
we incurred million in exit costs in we estimated in april of that the program will reduce annual operating expenses by approximately million beginning in in  we reported in aggregate million of costs related to the relocation of our sunnyvale  california activities to austin  texas that did not meet the definition of exit costs 
this included costs of product sales of million  research and development costs of million  sales and marketing costs of million  and  general and administrative costs of million 
these expenses include accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements related to facilities that will cease to be used upon completion of the relocation  personnel recruiting and training expense  and  duplicative rent and employee cost  offset by forfeited stock compensation 
net earnings net earnings will be affected by the same trends that impact our revenues  gross product margin and operating margin 
in addition  net earnings will also be affected by other income and expenses  such as foreign currency gains and losses  and by income taxes 
we expect that we will report foreign currency gains or losses each period due primarily to changes in the value of the euro  british pound and australian dollar versus the us dollar 
our effective income tax rate is less than the us statutory rate as a substantial portion of our operations are outside the us in jurisdictions with lower tax rates  including costa rica  where we have a tax holiday that extends through december in years of loss  our effective tax rate has exceeded the us statutory rate due to the apportionment of income or loss between jurisdictions in which we operate 
we expect to be able to fully utilize our deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources historically  our liquidity needs have been to finance the costs of operations  to acquire complementary businesses or assets and to make repurchases of our common stock 
our operating cash flow has historically been affected by the overall profitability of the sales of our products  our ability to invoice and collect from customers in a timely manner  and our ability to efficiently implement our acquisition strategy and manage costs

table of contents the company has not included liabilities for uncertain tax positions in the above table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments because the company is unable to estimate the anticipated timing of payment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires our management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts of revenue  expenses  income  assets and liabilities  reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which our management uses judgment  assumptions and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements 
we describe our most significant accounting policies in note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the following accounting policies as those that require significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and that have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies are considered critical because they may result in fluctuations in our reported results from period to period due to the significant judgments  estimates and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and because the use of different judgments  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as appropriate based on changing conditions 
revenue recognition our principal sources of revenue are from sales of our products through our direct sales professionals  independent sales agents and independent distributors 
we recognize these revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement providing for the sale of a product  delivery of the product has occurred  the sale price of the product is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues include shipping and handling costs billed to customers 
shipping and handling costs incurred are presented as a part of cost of product sales 
for product sales made by our direct sales professionals or independent agents  our criteria for revenue recognition is complete when our product is delivered to end customers  such as surgical centers and hospitals 
these sales occur either through a purchase order submitted by the customer or through trunk sales 
for purchase orders  we ship product to and invoice the end customer directly 
for trunk sales  product is hand delivered at the end customer s premises from trunk stock maintained by the direct sales representative or independent agent and a bill only order is received notifying us of the product s delivery at which time we invoice the end customer 
sales to distributors occur either as stocking and replenishment orders or as drop shipments to end customers 
in the majority of cases involving sales to distributors  our requirements for revenue recognition are met when we deliver product to a particular distributor 
in the case of certain distributors  prior to march  we had agreed to pricing reductions based on the distributors ultimate reselling price and in those cases we recognized revenue on a sell through basis only after the distributor had sold our products to an end user 
in order to determine the amount of sell through revenue that should be recognized during a given reporting period  we relied on reports from the distributors that provided us with information about sales to end customers during the reporting period as well as the amount and types of our products in the distributor s inventory at the end of a reporting period 
our management was required to exercise a significant level of judgment to determine the accuracy and reliability of the reported information 
we used a first in first out accounting method to account for products sold by these distributors where we applied the sell through method 
our customers generally have the right to return or exchange products purchased from us for up to days from the date of product shipment 
at each period end  we determine the extent to which our revenues need to be reduced to account for returns and exchanges and we record a reserve against revenue recognized during that period for product returns and exchanges that our management estimates are likely to occur after the end of that period 
we base these estimates on our historical experience with our customers and on direct customer feedback prior to we had an agreement with one customer that provided for an extended right of exchange 
our management concluded that the duration of the exchange agreement with this customer was inconsistent with our revenue recognition criteria and as a result revenue related to product sales to this customer was deferred until the related right of exchange period expired during the first quarter of this customer no longer has this extended right of return 
our revenue recognition is also impacted by management s estimate of our customers ability to pay us pursuant to the terms of our customer agreements 
if after we have recognized revenue  collectability of an account receivable becomes doubtful  we will establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to the previously recognized revenue that remains uncollected 
where our management forms a judgment that a particular customer has not established a sufficient credit history but decides to deliver products to the customer  we will defer recognizing revenues on product sales to that customer 
table of contents until collectability is reasonably assured  which typically coincides with the collection of cash 
once the customer establishes a reliable payment history we generally return to normal revenue recognition based on our criteria 
we regularly review the creditworthiness of our customers considering such factors as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit standing  the age of accounts receivable balances  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay both individually and in the aggregate 
although the terms of our agreements with many of our customers provide that risk of loss passes to the customer upon shipment  we have historically accepted the risk of loss until product delivery 
accordingly  we only recognize revenues on a product sale if  in management s judgment  it has been delivered during the relevant reporting period 
the application of this policy requires our management to make estimates as to the timing of deliveries 
we base these estimates on our historical experience with product shipments to particular markets that we serve 
we periodically compare these estimates to actual results based on delivery confirmations to determine whether a change of estimate is required 
we generally recognize license fees and other revenue over the term of the associated agreement 
royalties represent the largest component of non product sales revenue and are recognized as earned  based on our estimates using current and historical trends adjusted for market factors  and are classified as royalties  fees and other revenues in the accompanying statements of operations 
inventory allowance we value our inventory based on cost 
we adjust the value of our inventory to the extent our management determines that our cost cannot be recovered due to obsolescence or other factors 
in order to make these determinations  our management uses estimates of future demand and sales prices for each product to determine appropriate inventory reserves and to make corresponding reductions in inventory values to reflect the lower of cost or market value 
long lived assets our goodwill balance is not amortized to expense  instead it is tested for impairment at least annually on october in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the fasb s new guidance on performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
if events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses  we perform an impairment analysis of goodwill at that date 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant asset 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  we determine our reporting units  determine qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair  if the answer is no further work is not required if the answer is yes  allocate goodwill to our various reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  determine the carrying value  or book value  of our reporting units  as some of the assets and liabilities related to each reporting unit are held by a corporate function  estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model  reconcile the fair value of our reporting units in total to our market capitalization adjusted for a subjectively estimated control premium and other identifiable factors  compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  and if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value then there is no impairment  if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  we must estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and recognize an impairment charge if the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis  including the identification of our reporting units  qualitative indicators of changes to a reporting unit s fair value  and determination of the reporting unit s fair value 
changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in further goodwill impairment charges 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates utilized are appropriate based on the information available to management 
on october   we performed our required annual goodwill impairment test 
we determined that we have one reporting unit and thus all of our operations  assets  and liabilities were allocated to the one reporting unit 
our closing stock price on october   was and we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding representing an imputed market capitalization of million 
our book value on october  was million  thus the fair value of our reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit and no further testing was required 
intangible assets with finite lives and property  plant and equipment are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
we monitor conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization or depreciation period 
we test these assets for potential 
table of contents impairment whenever our management concludes events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the original estimate of an asset s useful life and the impact of an event or circumstance on either an asset s useful life or carrying value involve significant judgment regarding estimates of the future cash flows associated with each asset 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us and other loss contingencies are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue a charge against income when our management determines that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  we accrue for the authoritative judgments or assertions made against us by government agencies at the time of their rendering regardless of our intent to appeal 
in determining the appropriate accounting for loss contingencies  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether an accrual should be established or adjusted 
estimating the probability that a loss will occur and estimating the amount of a loss or a range of loss involves significant judgment 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when we expect the amount of tax benefit to be realized is less than the carrying value of the deferred tax asset 
we make an evaluation at the end of each reporting period as to whether or not some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested 
while we may have concluded in the past that undistributed earnings will be permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances may change in the future 
changes in facts and circumstances may include a change in the estimated capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  or a change in our corporate liquidity requirements 
such changes could result in our management determining that some or all of such undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
in that event  we would be required to recognize income tax liabilities on the assumption that our foreign undistributed earnings will be distributed to the us accounting for income taxes involves uncertainty and judgment on how to interpret and apply tax laws and regulations within our annual tax filings 
such uncertainties from time to time may result in a tax position that may be challenged and overturned by a tax authority in the future which could result in additional tax liability  interest charges and possibly penalties 
an income tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
this can be a subjective and judgmental determination 
the liability for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is recorded as other non current liabilities 
interest on unpaid taxes and penalties when incurred are classified as a component of income tax expense 
series a convertible preferred stock our series a preferred stock is classified as mezzanine equity and is shown on our balance sheet net of issuance costs 
the difference between the carrying value of the series a preferred stock and its redemption value is accreted over years using the effective interest method 
as the series a preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holder  we immediately amortized the entire amount of the beneficial conversion feature  as determined on the date of issuance  as a dividend 
additional dividends are accrued at the stated rate each period so that the mezzanine equity carrying value will equal its redemption value on the fifth anniversary of the issuance when any remaining unconverted series a preferred stock could be redeemable at the option of the holder 
dividends declared on the series a preferred stock shares  the accretion of issuance costs and amortization of the beneficial conversion feature reduce the amount of net earnings that are available to common stockholders and are presented together as a separate amount on the consolidated statements of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share based payment awards made to employees  including employee stock options and restricted stock awards 
the determination of fair value involves a number of significant estimates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of employee stock options which requires a number of assumptions to determine the model inputs 
these include the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior which are based on historical data as well as expectations of future developments over the term of the option 
as stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and 
table of contents revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
management s estimate of forfeitures is based on historical experience but actual forfeitures could differ materially as a result of voluntary employee actions and involuntary actions which would result in a significant change in our stock based compensation expense amounts in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting pronouncements may have a significant effect on our results of operations  our financial condition  our net worth or our business operations 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance on testing goodwill for impairment which we adopted in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the performance of our annual goodwill impairment test 
the adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new requirements for the presentation of comprehensive income which becomes effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  management does not believe the adoption of the new guidance will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  primarily risks from changing interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may impact  adversely or otherwise  our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our interest income is dependent on changes in the general level of us interest rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of money market funds and various deposit accounts 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our cash and cash equivalents in thousands  except percentages cash and cash equivalents average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents less than foreign currency risk a significant portion of our international sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that the exchange rates for these currencies fluctuate against the us dollar  we will experience variations in our results of operations and financial condition 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  are denominated primarily in us dollars  however  we also maintain balances in various other currencies in support of local subsidiary operations 
the most important of these are euros  british pounds  swedish kroner  swiss francs  australian dollars  and costa rican colones 
a percent change in the december  exchange rates for these currencies would have an impact on pre tax income of approximately million 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange risk and do not anticipate doing so in the future
