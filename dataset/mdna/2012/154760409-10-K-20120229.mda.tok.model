item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business concentrations no individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to the assets or deposits of our bank  or in relation to the overall business of the company 
however  approximately of our loan portfolio held for investment at december  consisted of real estate related loans  including construction loans  residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans 
see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition loan portfolio 
our business activities are focused primarily in hawaii 
consequently  our results of operations and financial condition are impacted by the general economic trends in hawaii  particularly in the commercial and residential real estate markets 
during periods of economic strength  the real estate market and the real estate industry typically perform well  during periods of economic weakness  they typically are adversely affected

our former subsidiary central pacific homeloans  inc was merged into the bank in february supervision and regulation set forth below is a description of the material elements of the laws and regulations and other regulatory matters applicable to us and our bank 
such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us and our bank could have a material effect on our business 
regulatory agencies central pacific financial corp 
is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a bank holding company  central pacific financial corp 
is regulated under the bhc act and is subject to inspection  examination and supervision by the frb 
it is also subject to hawaii s code of financial institutions and is subject to inspection  examination and supervision by the dfi 
the company is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  as administered by the sec 
our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the trading symbol cpf  and we are subject to the rules of the nyse for companies listed there 
central pacific bank  as a hawaii chartered bank  is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination and regulation by the dfi and fdic 
central pacific financial corp  as a bank holding company  is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the frb 
in its periodic examinations  each of these regulatory bodies assesses our financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity and other aspects of our operations 
these bodies also determine whether our management is violating or has violated any law or regulation 
the dfi and frb  and separately the fdic as insurer of the bank s deposits  have various remedies available to them 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital or establish specific minimum capital ratios  to restrict the bank s growth  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  to institute a receivership  and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a hawaii chartered bank would result in a revocation of its charter 
regulatory actions in may  the regulatory consent order the consent order that the bank entered into with the fdic and the dfi on december  was lifted 
in place of the consent order  the board of directors of the bank entered into a memorandum of understanding the bank mou with the fdic and dfi effective may  the bank mou continues a number of the same requirements previously required by the consent order  including the maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improvement of our asset quality  limitations on credit extensions  maintenance of qualified management and the prohibition on cash dividends to cpf  among other matters 
in addition  the bank mou requires the bank to further reduce classified assets below the level previously required by the consent order 
the bank mou lowers the minimum leverage capital ratio that the bank is required to maintain from in the consent order to and does not mandate a minimum total risk based capital ratio 
in addition to the lifting of the consent order  in november  the separate memorandum of understanding relating to compliance with the bank secrecy act the bsa that the bank entered into with the fdic and dfi on february  was terminated 
in addition to the bank mou  the company continues to be subject to the written agreement with the frbsf and dfi dated july   which superseded in its entirety the memorandum of understanding that the company entered into on april  with the frbsf and dfi 
among other matters  the written agreement provides that unless we receive the consent of the frbsf and dfi  we cannot i pay dividends  ii receive dividends or payments representing a reduction in capital from the bank  iii directly or through our non bank subsidiaries make any payments on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities  iv directly or through any non bank subsidiaries incur  increase or guarantee any debt  or v purchase or redeem any shares of our stock 
the written agreement requires that our board of directors fully utilize the company s financial and managerial resources to ensure that the bank complies with the bank mou and any other supervisory action taken by the bank s regulators 
we were also required to submit to the frbsf an acceptable capital plan to maintain the capital requirements of the bank mou and cash flow projection 
even though the consent order has been replaced by the bank mou  the bank remains subject to a number of requirements as described above 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the material terms of the bank mou and the written agreement and are meeting the timeline for compliance set out in such agreements subject to our continuing efforts to improve core earnings and reduce the level of our nonperforming assets 
however  we cannot assure you whether or when the company and the bank will be in full compliance with the agreements with the regulators or whether or when the bank mou or the written agreement will be terminated 
even if terminated  we may still be subject to other agreements with regulators that restrict our activities and may also continue to impose capital ratio requirements 
the requirements and restrictions of the bank mou and the written agreement are judicially enforceable and the company or the bank s failure to comply with such requirements and restrictions may subject the company and the bank to additional regulatory restrictions including the imposition of a new consent order  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the termination of insurance of deposits  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank  the issuance of directives to increase capital or enter into a strategic transaction  whether by merger or otherwise  with a third party  if we again fall below the capital ratio requirements  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders 
bank holding company activities in general  the bhc act limits the business of bank holding companies which have not elected financial holding company status to banking  managing or controlling banks and other activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
we have not elected financial holding company status and are currently not eligible for such status 
as a result of the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act  which amended the bhc act  bank holding companies that are financial holding companies may engage in any activity  or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or ii complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the frb 
activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing  insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments 
if a bank holding company seeks to engage in the broader range of activities that are permitted under the bhc act for financial holding companies  i all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed and ii it must file a declaration with the frb that it elects to be a financial holding company 
a depository institution subsidiary is considered to be well capitalized if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed under capital adequacy and prompt corrective action below 
a depository institution subsidiary is considered well managed if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination 
in order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the bhc act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the bhc act  each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the community reinvestment act of the cra 
see community reinvestment act below 
the bhc act generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies that are not qualified as financial holding companies to commercial banks and companies engaged in activities that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
financial holding companies are also permitted to acquire companies engaged in activities that are financial in nature and in activities that are incidental and complementary to financial activities without prior frb approval 
the bhc act  the federal bank merger act  hawaii law and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks 
the bhc act requires the prior approval of the frb for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company 
in reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions  the bank regulatory authorities will consider  among other things  the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions  the capital position of the combined organization  the applicant s performance record under the cra see community reinvestment act below and fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities 
affiliate transactions transactions between our subsidiary bank  on the one hand  and cpf and its other subsidiaries  on the other hand  are regulated by the frb 
these regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions including loans due and extensions of credit from our subsidiary bank that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arm s length basis 
these regulations generally do not apply to transactions between a us bank subsidiary and its subsidiaries 
in general  these regulations require that any extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited  as to any one of cpf or its non bank subsidiaries  to of our subsidiary bank s capital stock and surplus  and  as to the holding company and all such non bank subsidiaries in the aggregate  to of our subsidiary bank s capital stock and surplus 
these restrictions  other than the of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate  are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries 
the dodd frank act significantly expands the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization 
for example  effective july  the dodd frank act required that the of capital limit on covered transactions begin to apply to financial subsidiaries 
it also required  effective july  that derivative transactions under which a bank or a subsidiary has credit exposure to an affiliate be treated as covered transactions  with the term credit exposure to be defined by the frb under its existing rulemaking authority 
source of strength doctrine frb policy historically has required bank holding companies to act as a source of strength to their bank subsidiaries and to commit capital and financial resources to support those subsidiaries 
the dodd frank act codifies this policy as a statutory requirement 
such support may be required by the frb at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it 
any capital loan by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks is subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks 
the bhc act provides that in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 
capital requirements banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
the fdic and dfi have substantially similar risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations 
the guidelines are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
under the guidelines  banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for tier capital and total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a banking organization s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories 
a depository institution s or holding company s capital  in turn  is classified in one of three tiers depending on type core capital tier 
tier capital includes common equity  retained earnings  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual stock at the holding company level  minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  most intangible assets and certain other assets 
supplementary capital tier 
tier capital includes  among other things  perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not meeting the tier definition  qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt and allowances for possible loan and lease losses  subject to limitations 
market risk capital tier 
tier capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
we  like other bank holding companies  are required to maintain tier capital and total risk based capital the sum of tier  tier and tier capital equal to at least and  respectively  of total risk weighted assets including various off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit 
our subsidiary bank  like other depository institutions  is required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines 
however  as described under regulatory actions above  we are currently subject to higher ratios as a result of the bank mou and written agreement 
bank holding companies and banks subject to the market risk capital guidelines are required to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into their risk based capital standards 
under the market risk capital guidelines  capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution s ongoing trading activities 
bank holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements 
the leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes 
the requirements necessitate a minimum leverage ratio of for bank holding companies and national banks that either have received the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority s risk based capital measure for market risk 
all other bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority 
for a depository institution to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  its leverage ratio must be at least 
prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act fdia  as amended by the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  requires among other things  federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the fdicia establishes five capital categories for fdic insured banks well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital category will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors as established by regulation 
the relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio  the tier capital ratio and the leverage ratio 
under fdicia  a depository institution is deemed to be i well capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  a leverage ratio of or greater in certain circumstances and is not well capitalized  iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than in certain circumstances  iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than  and v critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal to or less than of average quarterly tangible assets 
an institution may be downgraded to or deemed to be in a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters 
a bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes 
the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the agencies may not accept such a plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan 
the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or ii the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the following table sets forth the company s and the bank s capital ratios  as well as the minimum requirements to be deemed adequately capitalized applicable generally to all financial institutions as of the dates indicated 
at december   each of the company and the bank was in compliance with the minimum ratios required by the bank mou and the levels required for a well capitalized regulatory designation 
minimum required to be minimum required actual adequately capitalized to be well capitalized amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands company as of december  tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage capital as of december  tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage capital central pacific bank as of december  tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage capital as of december  tier risk based capital total risk based capital leverage capital basel accords the current risk based capital guidelines which apply to the company and the bank are based upon the capital accord referred to as basel i of the international basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries 
the basel committee develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new framework and accord  referred to as basel ii  evolved from to out of the efforts to revise capital adequacy standards for internationally active banks 
basel ii emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  and supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements and became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the united states in total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more 
basel ii was optional for others  and if adopted  must first be complied with in a parallel run for two years along with the existing basel i standards 
in december  the basel committee released two consultative documents proposing significant changes to bank capital  leverage and liquidity requirements in response to the economic downturn to enhance the basel ii framework which had not yet been fully implemented internationally and even less so in the united states 
the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors commonly referred to as the g  including the united states  endorsed the reform package  referred to as basel iii  and proposed phase in timelines in november basel iii provides for increases in the minimum tier common equity ratio and the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio 
basel iii additionally includes a capital conservation buffer on top of the minimum requirement designed to absorb losses in periods of financial and economic distress  and an additional required countercyclical buffer percentage to be implemented according to a particular nation s circumstances 
these capital requirements are further supplemented under basel iii by a non risk based leverage ratio 
basel iii also reaffirms the basel committee s intention to introduce higher capital requirements on securitization and trading activities 
the basel iii liquidity proposals have three main elements i a liquidity coverage ratio designed to meet the bank s liquidity needs over a day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario  ii a net stable funding ratio designed to promote more medium and long term funding over a one year time horizon  and iii a set of monitoring tools that the basel committee indicates should be considered as the minimum types of information that banks should report to supervisors 
implementation of basel iii in the united states will require regulations and guidelines by united states banking regulators  which may differ in significant ways from the recommendations published by the basel committee 
it is unclear how united states banking regulators will define well capitalized in their implementation of basel iii and to what extent and when smaller banking organizations in the united states will be subject to these regulations and guidelines 
basel iii standards  if adopted  would lead to significantly higher capital requirements  higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios 
united states banking regulators must also implement basel iii in conjunction with the provisions of the dodd frank act related to increased capital and liquidity requirements 
further  the dodd frank act requires minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements on a consolidated basis for all depository institution holding companies and insured depository institutions that cannot be less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment  july  insolvency of an insured depository institution if the fdic were appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution such as central pacific bank  upon its insolvency or in certain other events  the fdic has the power i to transfer any of the depository institution s assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institution s creditors  ii to enforce the terms of the depository institution s contracts pursuant to their terms  or iii to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party  the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution 
in addition  under federal law  the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution  including claims of debt holders of the institution  in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver 
as a result  whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of central pacific bank  the debt holders would be treated differently from  and could receive  if anything  substantially less than  the depositors of the depository institution 
legislative initiatives from time to time  various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in congress and state legislatures  as well as by regulatory agencies 
such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system 
such legislation could change banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us or any of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the dodd frank act significantly revised and expanded the rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement authority of the federal bank regulatory agencies 
the numerous rules and regulations that have been promulgated and are yet to be promulgated and finalized under the dodd frank act are likely to significantly impact our operations and compliance costs 
the dodd frank act followed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa and the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra in response to the economic downturn and financial industry instability 
additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before congress  the california legislature  and other government bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions and may subject us to increased supervision and disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various bank regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations and policies to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulatory changes in policy may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the bank would be affected thereby 
in addition  the outcome of examinations  any litigation  or any investigations initiated by state or federal authorities may result in necessary changes in our operations and increased compliance costs 
the dodd frank act impacts many aspects of the financial industry and  in many cases  will impact larger and smaller financial institutions and community banks differently over time 
many of the following key provisions of the dodd frank act affecting the financial industry are now either effective or are in the proposed rule or implementation stage the creation of a financial services oversight counsel to identify emerging systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation  expansion of fdic authority to conduct the orderly liquidation of certain systemically significant non bank financial companies in addition to depository institutions  the establishment of strengthened capital and liquidity requirements for banks and bank holding companies  including minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements no less than the strictest requirements in effect for depository institutions as of the date of enactment  the requirement by statute that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries  enhanced regulation of financial markets  including the derivative and securitization markets  and the elimination of certain proprietary trading activities by banks the volcker rule  the termination of investments by the us treasury the treasury under tarp  the elimination and phase out of trust preferred securities from tier capital with certain exceptions under which our trust preferred securities qualify  a permanent increase of the previously implemented temporary increase of fdic deposit insurance to  and an extension of federal deposit coverage until january   for the full net amount held by depositors in non interesting bearing transaction accounts  authorization for financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts  changes in the calculation of fdic deposit insurance assessments  such that the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but instead will be its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity  the elimination of remaining barriers to de novo interstate branching by banks  expanded restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under section a and b of the federal reserve act and lending limits for derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions  the elimination of the office of thrift supervision and the transfer of oversight of thrift institutions and their holding companies to the office of the comptroller of the currency or the fdic and federal reserve  provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at most united states publicly traded companies  including i stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation  ii executive compensation clawback requirements for companies listed on national securities exchanges in the event of materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iii enhanced independence requirements for compensation committee members  and iv giving the sec authority to adopt proxy access rules which would permit stockholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as director and have those nominees included in a company s proxy statement  and the creation of a bureau of consumer financial protection the bureau  which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to bank and non bank financial products and which may examine and enforce its regulations on banks with more than billion in assets 
in general  more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage requirements are expected to impact our business as the dodd frank act is fully implemented 
the federal agencies have issued proposed rules which will apply directly to larger institutions with either more than billion in assets or more than billion in assets  such as proposed federal reserve regulations for financial institutions deemed systemically significant  federal reserve and fdic proposed rules requiring stress tests and the federal reserve proposed rules to implement the volcker rule 
further  the requirements and policies imposed on larger institutions may subsequently in some cases become expected best practices for smaller institutions 
therefore  as a result of the changes required by the dodd frank act  the profitability of our business activities may be impacted and we may be required to make changes to certain of our business practices 
these changes may also require us to devote significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements 
we participated in tarp  which was designed to bolster eligible healthy institutions by injecting capital into these institutions  so that we could continue to lend and support our then current and prospective clients 
in order to participate in tarp  financial institutions were required to adopt certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
arra also included a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health and education needs 
arra imposes certain new  more stringent executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all tarp recipients until the treasury is repaid 
we have complied with the compensation provisions of tarp and arra and have certified as to such compliance in the exhibits attached to this report pursuant to section b of the eesa 
we will remain subject to tarp so long as the treasury continues to hold our common stock 
dividends we are incorporated in hawaii and are governed by hawaii law 
because our primary business is to serve as a bank holding company for the bank  our ability to pay dividends is affected by the bank s ability to pay dividends to us 
under hawaii law  the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to us is subject to the hawaii state law that prohibits a state chartered bank from declaring or paying dividends greater than its retained earnings 
as of december   the bank had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
as a result of the bank mou  written agreement and the terms of our trust preferred securities  dividend payments require approval by our regulators and are restricted until our obligations under our trust preferred securities are brought current 
see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity  related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities dividends for a further discussion of our dividends 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
the fdic insures our customer deposits through the deposit insurance fund the dif up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased to  and all non interest bearing transaction accounts are insured through december  the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
due to the greatly increased rate of bank failures experienced in the current period of financial stress  as well as the extraordinary programs in which the fdic has been involved to support the banking industry generally  the dif was substantially depleted and the fdic has incurred substantially increased operating costs 
on november   the fdic adopted a requirement for most institutions to prepay in their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and however  our bank was exempt from doing so 
the dodd frank act also changes the base for fdic insurance assessments to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than upon its deposit base alone  and requires the fdic to increase the dif s reserves against future losses 
this will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than billion 
as required by the dodd frank act  on october   the fdic further addressed plans to bolster the dif by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to ratio of reserves to insured deposits by september  current assessment rates will remain in effect until such time as the industry s reserve ratio reaches  which the fdic estimates will occur at the end of the fdic also proposed to raise its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until we are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the fdic otherwise determines  we may be required to pay even higher fdic premiums than the recently increased levels 
these announced increases and any future increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material and adverse affect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of  or market for  our common stock 
all fdic insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the dif 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in the fdic may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the dif or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank s charter by the dfi 
depositor preference the fdia provides that  in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution  the claims of depositors of the institution  including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors  and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver  will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution 
if an insured depository institution fails  insured and uninsured depositors  along with the fdic  will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured  non deposit creditors  including the parent bank holding company  with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution 
community reinvestment act the cra requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice 
under the cra  each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by  among other things  providing credit to low and moderate income individuals and communities 
depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the cra and are assigned ratings 
furthermore  banking regulators take into account cra ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction 
operations and consumer compliance laws the bank must comply with numerous federal anti money laundering and consumer protection statutes and implementing regulations  including the usa patriot act of  the bank secrecy act  the foreign account tax compliance act effective  the cra  the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  the equal credit opportunity act  the truth in lending act  the fair housing act  the home mortgage disclosure act  the real estate settlement procedures act  the national flood insurance act and various federal and state privacy protection laws 
the bank and the company are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices  untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition 
these laws and regulations also mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to lawsuits and penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
the dodd frank act provided for the creation of the bureau as an independent entity within the federal reserve 
the bureau is a new regulatory agency for united states banks 
the bureau has broad rulemaking  supervisory  and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services  including deposit products  residential mortgages  home equity loans and credit cards 
the bureau s functions include investigating consumer complaints  conducting market research  rulemaking  supervising and examining banks consumer transactions  and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services 
pursuant to the dodd frank act  banks such as our bank with less than billion in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws and the regulations of the bureau by their primary federal banking agency 
employees at december   we employed persons  on a full time basis and on a part time basis 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement 
protection of net operating losses we have generated considerable tax benefits  including net operating loss carry forwards and federal and state tax credits 
our use of the tax benefits in the future would be significantly limited if we experience an ownership change for us federal income tax purposes 
in general  an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative increase in the company s ownership by percent shareholders as defined under us income tax laws that exceeds percentage points over a rolling three year period 
on november   our board declared a dividend of preferred share purchase rights rights in respect of our common stock which were issued pursuant to a tax benefits preservation plan  dated as of november  the tax benefits preservation plan  between the company and wells fargo bank  national association  as rights agent 
each right represents the right to purchase  upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the plan   th of a share of our junior participating preferred stock  series c  no par value  for  subject to adjustment 
the tax benefits preservation plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that the company will experience an ownership change by discouraging any person from becoming a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock a threshold holder 
there is no guarantee  however  that the tax benefits preservation plan will prevent the company from experiencing an ownership change 
adoption of the tax benefits preservation plan was required by our agreements with the carlyle group carlyle and anchorage capital group  llc anchorage 
to further protect our tax benefits  on january   our board approved a proposed amendment to our restated articles of incorporation to restrict transfers of our stock if the effect of an attempted transfer would cause the transferee to become a threshold holder or to cause the beneficial ownership of a threshold holder to increase the protective charter amendment 
at our annual meeting of shareholders on april   we proposed the amendment which shareholders voted on and approved 
the protective charter amendment also does not guarantee that we will not experience an ownership change

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risk factors related to our business we continue to be subject to a number of requirements and prohibitions under regulatory orders imposed on us and we cannot assure you whether or when such orders will be lifted 
the bank mou continues a number of the same requirements previously required by the consent order  including the maintenance of an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses  improvement of our asset quality  limitations on credit extensions  maintenance of qualified management and the prohibition on cash dividends to the company  among other matters 
in addition  the bank mou requires the bank to further reduce classified assets below the level previously required by the consent order 
the bank mou lowers the minimum leverage capital ratio that the bank is required to maintain from in the consent order to and does not mandate a minimum total risk based capital ratio 
in addition  the written agreement provides that unless we receive the consent of the frbsf and dfi  we cannot i pay dividends  ii receive dividends or payments representing a reduction in capital from the bank  iii directly or through our non bank subsidiaries make any payments on subordinated debentures or trust preferred securities  iv directly or through any non bank subsidiaries incur  increase or guarantee any debt  or v purchase or redeem any shares of our stock 
the written agreement requires that the board of directors fully utilize the company s financial and managerial resources to ensure that the bank complies with the bank mou and other regulatory orders 
even though the consent order has been replaced by the bank mou  the bank remains subject to a number of requirements as described above 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the material terms of the bank mou and the written agreement and are meeting the timelines for compliance set out in such agreements subject to our continuing efforts to improve our core earnings and reduce the level of our nonperforming assets 
however  we cannot assure you whether or when the company and the bank will be in full compliance with the agreements with the regulators or whether or when the written agreement and the bank mou will be terminated 
even if terminated  we may still be subject to other agreements with regulators that restrict our activities and may also continue to impose capital ratio requirements 
the requirements and restrictions of the written agreement and the bank mou are judicially enforceable and the company or the bank s failure to comply with such requirements and restrictions may subject the company and the bank to additional regulatory restrictions including the imposition of a new consent order  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the termination of insurance of deposits  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank  the issuance of directives to increase capital or enter into a strategic transaction  whether by merger or otherwise  with a third party  if we again fall below the capital ratio requirements  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders 
in addition to the bank mou and written agreement  governmental regulation and regulatory actions against us may further impair our operations or restrict our growth 
in addition to the requirements of the bank mou and written agreement  we are subject to significant governmental supervision and regulation 
these regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
statutes and regulations affecting our business may be changed at any time and the interpretation of these statutes and regulations by examining authorities may also change 
in addition  regulations may be adopted which increase our deposit insurance premiums and enact special assessments which could increase expenses associated with running our business and adversely affect our earnings 
there can be no assurance that such changes to the statutes and regulations or to their interpretation will not adversely affect our business 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
in addition to governmental supervision and regulation  we are subject to changes in other federal and state laws  including changes in tax laws  which could materially affect the banking industry 
we are subject to the rules and regulations of the frbsf  fdic and dfi and may be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the consumer financial protection bureau which was recently created pursuant to the dodd frank act 
if we fail to comply with federal and state bank regulations  the regulators may limit our activities or growth  impose fines on us or ultimately cease our operations 
banking laws and regulations change from time to time 
bank regulations can hinder our ability to compete with financial services companies that are not regulated in the same manner or are less regulated 
federal and state bank regulatory agencies regulate many aspects of our operations 
these areas include the capital that must be maintained  the kinds of activities that can be engaged in  the kinds and amounts of investments that can be made  the locations of offices  insurance of deposits and the premiums that we must pay for this insurance  and how much cash we must set aside as reserves for deposits 
in particular  president obama signed the dodd frank act into law on july  the dodd frank act provides for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states 
while the full effects of the legislation on us cannot yet be determined  it could result in higher compliance and other costs as a result of new regulations and new regulatory initiatives  reduced revenues and higher capital and liquidity requirements  among other things  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities have the authority to bring enforcement actions against banks and bank holding companies for unsafe or unsound practices in the conduct of their businesses or for violations of any law  rule or regulation  any condition imposed in writing by the appropriate bank regulatory agency or any written agreement with the authority 
possible enforcement actions against us could include a federal conservatorship or receivership for the bank  the issuance of additional orders that could be judicially enforced  the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to enter into a strategic transaction  whether by merger or otherwise  with a third party  the termination of insurance of deposits  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders 
despite signs of stabilization  uncertainty about the global and us economies could have an adverse effect on us 
although general economic trends and market conditions continue to show signs of stabilization  concerns about the global and us economies still remain  including weak consumer confidence  relatively high unemployment rates and increased volatility in both energy prices and the capital markets 
further concerns about the euro zone government debt crisis and the credit ratings of global and european financial institutions could negatively impact the global financial system and adversely affect any economic recovery in the united states 
in addition  growing government indebtedness  a large budget deficit  and concerns over the federal debt ceiling have exacerbated the uncertainty surrounding a sustained economic recovery 
on august   legislation was enacted to increase the federal debt ceiling and to reduce future spending levels by as much as trillion over the next years 
on august   standard poor s s p downgraded the us long term debt rating from its aaa rating to aa 
on august   s p downgraded from aaa to aa the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other us government agencies linked to long term us debt 
while the potential effects of these downgrades are difficult to determine  they could raise borrowing costs and adversely impact the mortgage and housing markets  any of which could have one or more of the following adverse impacts on us i loan delinquencies may increase  ii problem assets and foreclosures may increase leading to higher loan charge offs  iii demand for our products and services may decline  iv low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and v collateral for loans made by us  especially involving real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
difficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected our industry and renewed economic slowdown in hawaii or a worsening of current market conditions in general would result in additional adverse effects on us 
the us economy entered into one of the longest economic recessions to have occurred since the great depression of the s in december although general economic trends and market conditions have since stabilized to some degree  a renewed economic slowdown in hawaii or a worsening of current market conditions in general would likely result in additional adverse effects on us  including i loan delinquencies may increase  ii problem assets and foreclosures may increase leading to more loan charge offs  iii demand for our products and services may decline  iv low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and v collateral for loans made by us  especially involving real estate  may continue to decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans 
furthermore  unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  our business and operations are closely tied to the hawaii market 
the hawaii economy relies on tourism  real estate  government and other service based industries 
declines in tourism  increases in energy costs  the availability of affordable air transportation  adverse weather and natural disasters and local budget issues impact consumer and corporate spending 
as a result  such events may contribute to the deterioration in hawaii s general economic condition  which could adversely impact us and our borrowers 
the high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans in our portfolio  combined with the deterioration in these sectors caused by the economic downturn  had and may continue to have a significantly more adverse impact on our operating results than many other banks across the nation 
although we have taken a number of steps to reduce our credit risk exposure over the past several quarters  we still had million in nonperforming assets at december  if our borrowers continue to experience financial difficulty  or if property values securing our real estate loans decline further  we will continue to incur elevated credit costs due to the composition of our loan portfolio even if market conditions stabilize or improve 
our hawaii and  to a lesser extent  california commercial real estate and construction loan operations have a considerable effect on our results of operations 
the performance of our hawaii and california commercial real estate and construction loans depends on a number of factors  including the continued stabilization and eventual improvement of the real estate markets in which we operate 
as we have seen in the hawaii and california construction and commercial real estate markets since the latter part of  the strength of the real estate market and the results of our operations could continue to be negatively affected by the economic downturn 
while we are no longer originating new loans out of our mainland operations  we still have a sizable california loan portfolio and the performance of that portfolio continues to be subject to market conditions in california 
as we have seen in recent years  declines in the market for commercial property are causing commercial borrowers to suffer losses on their projects and they may be unable to repay their loans 
defaults of these loans or further deterioration in the credit worthiness of any of these borrowers would further negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
declines in housing prices and the supply of existing houses for sale are causing residential developers who are our borrowers to also suffer losses on their projects and encounter difficulty in repaying their loans 
although during the year ended december   we saw improvement in our credit risk profile and significant reductions in our nonperforming assets  which resulted in a credit to our provision for loan and lease losses of million  from the third quarter of through we significantly increased our provision for loan and lease losses as a result of these challenging conditions 
during the year ended december   our provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million  compared to million in and million in as of december   our percentage of nonperforming assets to total loans and leases  loans held for sale and other real estate was  compared to as of december  and as of december  we cannot assure you that we will have an adequate provision for loan and lease losses to cover future losses 
if we suffer greater losses than we are projecting  our recovery plan and the ability to improve our position will be materially adversely affected 
our allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
additional loan losses may occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral or guarantees securing these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment 
although during the year ended december   we recorded a credit to our provision for loan and lease losses amounting to million  for the years ended december   and  our provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
our current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
we may experience significant loan losses that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  which are regularly reevaluated and are based in part on current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential loan losses and the present level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  results of examinations of our loan portfolios by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the size of the allowance for loan and lease losses  we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio  our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions  as well as the requirements of the bank mou and other regulatory input 
if our assumptions prove to be incorrect  our current allowance for loan and lease losses may not be sufficient to cover the losses 
because of the uncertainty in the economy  volatility in the credit and real estate markets  including specifically  the deterioration in the hawaii and california real estate markets and our high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans  we made significant adjustments to our allowance for loan and lease losses over the past several years and may need to make additional adjustments in the future 
in addition  third parties  including our federal and state regulators  periodically evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may communicate with us concerning the methodology or judgments that we have raised in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses 
as a result of this input  we may be required to assign different grades to specific credits  increase our provision for loan and lease losses  and or recognize further loan charge offs 
a large percentage of our real estate loans are construction loans which involve the additional risk that a project may not be completed  increasing the risk of loss 
approximately of our real estate loan portfolio as of december  was comprised of construction loans 
fifty six percent of these construction loans were in hawaii while were located on the mainland 
many of our construction loans are reliant upon sponsors and or guarantors for additional support 
repayment of construction loans is dependent upon the successful completion of the construction project  on time and within budget  and the successful sale of a completed project or the conversion of the construction loan into a term loan 
if a borrower is unable to complete a construction project or if the marketability or value of the completed development is impaired  proceeds from the sale of the subject property may be insufficient to repay the loan 
during the years ended december   and  our construction loan portfolio was significantly impacted by an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults  as well as declining collateral values resulting from the downturn in the commercial real estate markets in hawaii and california and the significant negative impact this had on our borrowers  guarantors  and many of the projects securing our construction loans 
although economic conditions stabilized and showed signs of improvement in  our construction loan portfolio may continue to experience material credit losses due to our concentration of loans with exposure to this sector combined with the continuing uncertainty of some of our construction borrowers and guarantors 
a large percentage of our loans are collateralized by real estate and continued deterioration in the real estate market may result in additional losses and adversely affect our financial results 
our results of operations have been  and in future periods  will continue to be significantly impacted by the economy in hawaii  and to a lesser extent  other markets we are exposed to including california 
approximately of our loan portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans primarily collateralized by real estate  with the majority of these loans concentrated in hawaii 
deterioration of the economic environment in hawaii  california or other markets we are exposed to  including a continued decline or worsening declines in the real estate market and single family home resales or a material external shock  may significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
in the event of a default with respect to any of these loans  amounts received upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover outstanding principal and interest on the loan 
over the past four years  material declines in the value of the real estate assets securing many of our commercial real estate loans has led to significant credit losses in this portfolio 
as a result of our particularly high concentration of commercial real estate and construction loans  the risk within our portfolio is higher than many financial institutions and  as a result  our portfolio had been and remains particularly susceptible to significant credit losses during economic downturns and adverse changes in the real estate market 
because of our high concentration of loans secured by real estate the majority of which were originated several years ago  it is possible that we will continue to experience elevated levels of credit losses and higher provisions for loan and lease losses even if the overall real estate market continues to stabilize or improves due to the continuing uncertainty surrounding many of the specific real estate assets securing our loans and the weakened financial condition of many of our commercial real estate borrowers and guarantors 
our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted 
we have generated significant net operating losses nols as a result of our recent losses 
we generally are able to carry nols forward to reduce taxable income in future years 
however  our ability to utilize the nols is subject to the rules of section of the internal revenue code 
section generally restricts the use of nols after an ownership change 
an ownership change occurs if  among other things  the shareholders or specified groups of shareholders who own or have owned  directly or indirectly  or more of a corporation s common stock or are otherwise treated as shareholders under section and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation s stock by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these shareholders over a three year rolling period 
in the event of an ownership change  section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with nol carry forwards 
this annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of the corporation s stock on the date of the ownership change  multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate published monthly by the internal revenue service 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective nol carry forwards 
in order to reduce the likelihood that transactions in our common stock will result in an ownership change  on november   we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan  which provides an economic disincentive for any person or group to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our common stock 
to further protect our nol carryforwards  on may   we filed the protective charter amendment to restrict transfers of our common stock if the effect of the transfer would be to cause the transferee to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our common stock a threshold holder or cause the beneficial ownership of our common stock by any threshold holder to increase 
however  we cannot ensure that our ability to use our nols to offset income will not become limited in the future 
as a result  we could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if our nols were available to reduce our federal income taxes without restriction 
the protective charter amendment expires on the earliest of i may   ii such time as the board of directors determines the protective charter amendment is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax benefits and iii the date the board of directors determines that the protective charter amendment is no longer in our and our shareholders best interest 
our ability to maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity and required capital levels may be negatively impacted by uncertainty in the economic environment which may  among other things  impact our ability to satisfy our obligations 
liquidity is essential to our business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of investments or loans  and other sources would have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include concerns regarding the continued deterioration in our financial condition  increased regulatory actions against us and a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans or deposits are concentrated 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the credit markets 
the management of liquidity risk is critical to the management of our business and our ability to service our customer base 
in managing our balance sheet  our primary source of funding is customer deposits 
our ability to continue to attract these deposits and other funding sources is subject to variability based upon a number of factors including volume and volatility in the securities markets  our financial condition  our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities 
the availability and level of deposits and other funding sources is highly dependent upon the perception of the liquidity and creditworthiness of the financial institution  which perception can change quickly in response to market conditions or circumstances unique to a particular company 
concerns about our past and future financial condition or concerns about our credit exposure to other persons could adversely impact our sources of liquidity  financial position  including regulatory capital ratios  results of operations and our business prospects 
if the level of deposits were to materially decrease  we would need to raise additional funds by increasing the interest that we pay on certificates of deposits or other depository accounts  seek other debt or equity financing or draw upon our available lines of credit 
we rely on commercial and retail deposits  and to a lesser extent  advances from the fhlb and the federal reserve discount window  to fund our operations 
although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  we might not be able to replace such funds in the future if  among other things  our results of operations or financial condition or the results of operations or financial condition of the fhlb or market conditions were to change 
our line of credit with the fhlb serves as our primary outside source of liquidity 
the federal reserve discount window also serves as an additional outside source of liquidity 
borrowings under this arrangement are through the federal reserve s secondary facility and are subject to providing additional information regarding the financial condition of the bank and reasons for the borrowing 
the duration of borrowings from the federal reserve discount window are generally for a very short period  usually overnight 
in the event that these outside sources of liquidity become unavailable to us  we will need to seek additional sources of liquidity  including selling assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell assets at a level to allow us to repay borrowings or meet our liquidity needs 
we constantly monitor our activities with respect to liquidity and evaluate closely our utilization of our cash assets  however  there can be no assurance that our liquidity or the cost of funds to us may not be materially and adversely impacted as a result of economic  market  or operational considerations that we may not be able to control 
because of our participation in tarp and under the terms of our exchange agreement with the treasury  we are subject to restrictions on compensation paid to our executives  which may make it difficult to attract and retain key members of management 
pursuant to the terms of the tarp capital purchase program tarp cpp  we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which treasury owns any debt or equity securities acquired pursuant to tarp 
these standards generally apply to our five most highly compensated senior executive officers  including our president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer  and or certain of these restrictions also apply up to the next most highly compensated senior executives 
the standards include  among other things ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executives does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  a required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer and the next twenty most highly compensated employees based on materially inaccurate financial statements or any other materially inaccurate financial performance metric criteria  a prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and the next five most highly compensated employees  an agreement not to deduct for tax purposes annual compensation in excess of  for each senior executive officer  and limitations on bonuses and incentive compensation 
we depend on the services of existing management to carry out our business strategy 
in addition  our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain other key employees 
see we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people below 
the loss of the services of any management personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation may increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods and make it more difficult to attract suitable candidates to serve as executive officers 
we are also obligated to comply with any subsequent amendments to these restrictions for so long as we remain subject to such restrictions 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates 
like most financial institutions  our earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
we expect that we will periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  meaning that either our interest bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest earning assets  or vice versa 
if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap will work against us and our earnings may be negatively affected 
in light of our current volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  our net interest margin could be expected to increase during periods of rising interest rates and  conversely  to decline during periods of falling interest rates 
we are unable to predict or control fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by many factors  including the following inflation  recession  changes in unemployment  the money supply  international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets  and governmental actions 
our asset liability management strategy may not be able to control our risk from changes in market interest rates and it may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time  we may reposition our assets and liabilities to reduce our net interest income volatility 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to effectively manage the composition of our investment securities portfolio  which we expect will continue to comprise a significant portion of our earning assets  our net interest income and net interest margin could be adversely affected 
our primary sources of interest income include interest on loans and leases  as well as interest earned on investment securities 
interest earned on investment securities represented of our interest income in the year ended december  as compared to of our interest income in the year ended december  we face significant competition for loans and leases that meet our credit profile 
in addition  as part of our recovery plan  we have experienced a significant reduction in average loans and leases as we have continued our efforts to reduce our credit risk exposure  while deploying more excess cash and cash equivalents into investment securities 
accordingly  effectively managing our investment securities portfolio to generate interest income while managing the composition and risks associated with that portfolio  including the mix of government agency and non agency securities  has become increasingly important 
if we are unable to effectively manage our investment securities portfolio or if the interest income generated by our investment securities portfolio declines  our net interest income and net interest margin could be adversely affected 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our deposit customers may pursue alternatives to deposits at our bank or seek higher yielding deposits causing us to incur increased funding costs 
we are facing increasing deposit pricing pressures 
checking and savings account balances and other forms of deposits can decrease when our deposit customers perceive alternative investments  such as the stock market or other non depository investments as providing superior expected returns or seek to spread their deposits over several banks to maximize fdic insurance coverage 
furthermore  technology and other changes have made it more convenient for the bank s customers to transfer funds into alternative investments including products offered by other financial institutions or non bank service providers 
additional increases in short term interest rates could increase transfers of deposits to higher yielding deposits 
efforts and initiatives we undertake to retain and increase deposits  including deposit pricing  can increase our costs 
when the bank s customers move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments or into higher yielding deposits  or spread their accounts over several banks  we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds  thus increasing our funding costs 
the fiscal  monetary and regulatory policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments  both of which affect the net interest margin 
it also can materially decrease the value of financial assets we hold  such as debt securities 
its policies also can adversely affect borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
changes in federal reserve board policies and our regulatory environment generally are beyond our control  and we are unable to predict what changes may occur or the manner in which any future changes may affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we have to offer higher rates of interest then we currently offer on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
because we are a holding company with no significant operations other than our bank  we depend upon dividends from our bank for a substantial portion of our revenues 
in addition to obtaining approval from the fdic and dfi  hawaii law only permits the bank to pay dividends out of retained earnings 
given that the bank had an accumulated deficit of million at december   the bank is prohibited from paying any dividends until this deficit is eliminated 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that the bank will be permitted to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
in addition  even if the bank was able to pay us dividends  we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed and implemented to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to various legal claims and litigation 
from time to time  customers  employees and others that we do business with make claims and take legal action against us for various business occurrences  including the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
regardless of whether these claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services  as well as impact customer demand for our products and services 
any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
even if these claims and legal actions do not result in a financial liability or reputational damage  defending these claims and actions have resulted in  and will continue to result in  increased legal and professional services costs  which adds to our noninterest expense and negatively impacts our operating results 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional and community banks within the various markets we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks conduct significant business in the market areas in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings banks  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of our financial condition may also affect our competitiveness 
customers may decide not to do business with the bank due to its financial condition 
in addition  our ability to compete is impacted by the limitations on our activities imposed under the bank mou and written agreement 
we have and continue to face additional regulatory restrictions that our competitors may not be subject to  including reducing our commercial real estate loan portfolio and improving the overall risk profile of the company  which could adversely impact our ability to compete and attract and retain customers 
the federal home loan bank of seattle has entered into a consent order with the federal housing finance agency 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of seattle is classified as other than temporarily impaired or as permanently impaired  our earnings and stockholder s equity could decrease 
we own stock in the fhlb 
we hold this stock in order to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the fhlb s advance program 
the aggregate cost and fair value of our fhlb stock was million as of december  on october   the fhlb entered into a consent order with the federal housing finance agency the fhfa  which requires the fhlb to take certain specified actions related to its business and operations 
following the filing of the fhlb s second quarter quarterly report on form q with the sec  and once the fhlb reaches and maintains certain thresholds  it may begin repurchasing member capital stock at par 
further  the fhlb may again be in position to redeem certain capital stock from members and begin paying dividends once the fhlb achieves and maintains certain other financial and operational metrics  remediates certain concerns regarding its oversight and management  asset improvement program  capital adequacy and retained earnings  risk management  compensation practices  examination findings  and information technology  and returns to a safe and sound condition as determined by the fhfa 
any stock repurchases  redemptions and dividend payments will be subject to fhfa approval 
there continues to be a risk that the fhlb may not be permitted to redeem capital stock from members and begin paying dividends in the future  and that our investment in fhlb stock could be impaired at some time in the future 
if this occurs  our earnings and stockholders equity would be negatively impacted 
our business could be adversely affected by unfavorable actions from rating agencies 
ratings assigned by ratings agencies to us  our affiliates or our securities may impact the decision of certain customers  in particular  institutions  to do business with us 
a rating downgrade or a negative rating could adversely affect our deposits and our business relationships 
on february   fitch ratings upgraded the long term issuer default rating of the company and the bank from cc to b and removed the company and the bank from rating watch evolving 
on may   fitch ratings upgraded the long term issuer default rating of the company and the bank to b from b and assigned a positive rating outlook 
however  our ratings may not improve further and may be downgraded in the future if there are adverse developments concerning our business 
although we completed the private placement  we have incurred significant losses and cannot assure you that we will continue to be profitable in the future 
with the completion of the private placement in  the bank s capital ratios currently exceed the levels required by the bank mou and previously required by the consent order  and are at well capitalized levels 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was and total risk based capital ratio was 
however  even though we had net income of million for  we previously incurred significant losses  including net losses of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   primarily due to credit costs  including a significant provision for loan and lease losses 
although we have taken a number of steps to reduce our credit exposure  at december  we still had million in nonperforming assets and it is possible that we will continue to incur elevated credit costs over the near term  which would adversely impact our overall financial performance and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be profitable in the future 
the proceeds from the private placement may not be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity needs in the future or to satisfy changing regulatory requirements  and we may need to raise additional capital 
the proceeds from the private placement were raised to strengthen our capital base as previously required by the consent order 
as mentioned above  our capital ratios currently exceed the levels required by the bank mou and previously required by the consent order and are at well capitalized levels for regulatory purposes 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was and total risk based capital ratio was 
however  despite the increase in our capital base  if economic conditions continue to be difficult or worsen or fail to improve in a timely manner  or if our operations or financial condition continues to deteriorate or fails to improve  particularly in the residential and commercial real estate markets where our business is located  we may need to raise additional capital 
factors affecting whether we would need to raise additional capital include  among others  additional provisions for loan and lease losses and loan charge offs  changing requirements of regulators and other risks discussed in this risk factors section 
if we had to raise additional capital  there can be no assurance that we would be able to do so in the amounts required and in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  any additional capital raised may be significantly dilutive to our existing shareholders and may result in the issuance of securities that have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our common stock 
we may suffer substantial losses due to our agreements to indemnify investors in the private placement against a broad range of potential claims 
in our agreements with the investors in the private placement  we agreed to indemnify the investors for a broad range of claims  including losses resulting from the inaccuracy or breach of representations or warranties made by us in such agreements and the breach by us to perform our covenants contained in such agreements 
while these indemnities are subject to various limitations  if claims were successfully brought against us  it could potentially result in significant losses for the company 
as a result of the recapitalization  carlyle and anchorage are substantial holders of our common stock 
following the closing of the recapitalization  anchorage and carlyle each became beneficial owners of our outstanding common stock  with their respective ownership percentages each equating to approximately as of december  each has a representative on our board of directors 
accordingly  anchorage and carlyle have substantial influence over the election of directors to our board and over corporate policy  including decisions to enter into mergers or other extraordinary transactions 
in addition  carlyle and anchorage have certain preemptive rights to maintain their respective fully diluted percentage ownership of our common stock in the event of certain issuances of securities by us 
in pursuing their economic interests  anchorage and carlyle may make decisions with respect to fundamental corporate transactions that may not be aligned with the interests of other shareholders 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key people 
there are a limited number of qualified persons in hawaii with the knowledge and experience required to successfully implement our business strategy 
the more senior the executive  the more difficult it is to locate suitable candidates in the local market 
accordingly  in many circumstances  it is necessary for us to recruit potential candidates from the mainland 
at this time  new senior executives are required to be approved by our regulators 
suitable candidates for positions may decline to consider employment with the company given its financial condition and the current regulatory environment  particularly since in some circumstances  this would require that the employee relocate from the mainland to hawaii  where other employment opportunities in the banking industry may be limited 
in addition  it may be difficult for us to offer compensation packages that would be sufficient to convince candidates that are acceptable to our regulators and meet our requirements to agree to become our employee and or relocate 
see because of our participation in tarp and under the terms of our exchange agreement with the treasury  we are subject to restrictions on compensation paid to our executives  which may make it difficult to attract and retain key members of management above 
our financial condition and the existing uncertainties may result in existing employees seeking positions at other companies where these issues are not present 
the unexpected loss of services of other key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of a loss of their skills  knowledge of our market and years of industry experience 
if we are not able to promptly recruit qualified personnel  which we require to conduct our operations  our business and our ability to successfully implement our business strategy could be adversely affected 
the recent turnover in key positions in our finance and credit departments could increase the risk that our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 
our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the exchange act is accurately accumulated by management  and recorded  processed  summarized  and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
we believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met and depend on the sufficiency of the personnel involved in those functions 
there has been recent turnover in key positions in our finance and credit departments as part of the implementation of our recovery plan 
we have also experienced significant turnover on our executive management team within the past two years  including the appointments of a new executive chairman of the board of directors in june who is now the president and chief executive officer  new chief financial officer in august and again in october  new chief administrative officer in november  new chief credit officer in february  and a new chief information officer in june the recent changes to our executive management team  combined with the turnover within our finance and credit departments  could increase the risk that our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud 
risk factors related to our securities the market price of our common stock has declined significantly and is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are failure to comply with all of the requirements of the bank mou  the written agreement  and the possibility of resulting action by the regulators  deterioration of asset quality  the incurrence of losses  actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition  changes in revenue or earnings losses estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings losses estimates  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  additions or departures of key personnel  actions by institutional shareholders  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  future sales of our common stock  including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions  general market conditions and  in particular  developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry  proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments  anticipated or pending investigations  proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us  or domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock market and  in particular  the market for financial institution stocks  have experienced significant volatility over the past few years 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur 
in addition  sales of shares by investors in the private placement and treasury may cause our share price to decrease 
accordingly  the common stock that you purchase may trade at a price lower than that at which they were purchased 
volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent individual shareholders from being able to sell their shares when they want or at prices they find attractive 
a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for shareholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
the transferability of our common stock is limited as a result of the tax benefits preservation plan and the protective charter amendment 
as described under risk factors related to our business our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted  we have generated significant nols as a result of our recent losses 
in order to reduce the likelihood that transactions in our common stock would result in an ownership change  on november   we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan  which provides an economic disincentive for any person or group to become an owner  for relevant tax purposes  of or more of our common stock 
to further protect our nols  we filed the protective charter amendment on may  to restrict transfers of our stock if the effect of an attempted transfer would cause the transferee to become a threshold holder or cause the beneficial ownership of a threshold holder to increase 
the protective charter amendment expires on the earliest of i may   ii such time as the board of directors determines the protective charter amendment is no longer necessary for the preservation of our tax benefits and iii the date the board of directors determines that the protective charter amendment is no longer in our and our shareholders best interest 
the tax benefits preservation plan and the protective charter amendment have the effect of limiting transferability of our common stock because they may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire our common stock under the circumstances described above and  in the case of the protective charter amendment  prohibit certain acquisitions of our common stock as described above 
these transfer restrictions may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of the company and make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to consummate an acquisition of the company 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common shares and may limit a shareholder s ability to dispose of our common shares by reducing the class of potential acquirers for our common shares 
anti takeover provisions in our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and applicable federal and state law may limit the ability of another party to acquire us  which could cause our stock price to decline 
various provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and certain other actions we have taken could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders 
these include  among other things  the tax benefits preservation plan  the protective charter amendment and the authorization to issue blank check preferred stock by action of the board of directors acting alone  thus without obtaining shareholder approval 
in addition  applicable provisions of federal and state law require regulatory approval in connection with certain acquisitions of our common stock and supermajority voting provisions in connection with certain transactions 
these provisions of our restated articles of incorporation and by laws and federal and state law may prevent a merger or acquisition that would be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
resales of our common stock in the public market may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we issued a large number of common stock to the investors in the private placement and to the treasury in the tarp exchange 
carlyle and anchorage the lead investors have certain registration rights with respect to the common stock held by them 
in addition  we provided the treasury with certain registration rights with respect to the common stock issued to the treasury in exchange for our previously outstanding tarp preferred stock as well as the shares issuable upon exercise of the tarp warrant 
the registration rights for the lead investors and treasury will allow them to sell their common stock without compliance with the volume and manner of sale limitations under rule promulgated under the securities act 
the market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by the lead investors and treasury from time to time of a substantial amount of the common stock held by them 
our common stock is equity and therefore is subordinate to our subsidiaries indebtedness and preferred stock 
our common stock constitutes equity interests and does not constitute indebtedness 
as such  common stock will rank junior to all current and future indebtedness and other non equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us  including in the event of our liquidation 
we may  and the bank and our other subsidiaries may also  incur additional indebtedness from time to time and may increase our aggregate level of outstanding indebtedness 
as of december   we had million in face amount of trust preferred securities outstanding and accrued and unpaid dividends thereon of million 
additionally  holders of common stock are subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock that may be outstanding from time to time 
the board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
if we issue preferred shares in the future that have a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  or if we issue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  then the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
there is a limited trading market for our common stock and as a result  you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nyse  the volume of trading in our common shares is lower than many other companies listed on the nyse 
a public trading market with depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
our common stock is not insured and you could lose the value of your entire investment 
an investment in our common stock is not a deposit and is not insured against loss by the government
