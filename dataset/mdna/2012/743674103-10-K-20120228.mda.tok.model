item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  of this report on form k for additional information regarding these arrangements 
as of february   the company guaranteed the obligations of plico under a synthetic lease entered into by plico  as lessee  with a non affiliated third party  as lessor 
under the terms of the synthetic lease  financing of million was available to plico for construction of a new office building and parking deck 
the synthetic lease was amended and restated as of january   wherein as of december   the company continues to guarantee the obligations of plico thereunder 
the company has agreements with certain of its subsidiaries under which it supplies investment  legal and data processing services on a fee basis and provides other managerial and administrative services on a shared cost basis 
such other managerial and administrative services include but are not limited to accounting  financial reporting  compliance services  reinsurance administration  tax reporting  reserve computation  and projections 
as of december   the holding company plc had outstanding loaned securities from certain noninsurance subsidiaries with a fair value amount of million  including accrued interest 
these transactions were eliminated in consolidation 

table of contents the company has also entered into intercompany reinsurance agreements that provide for a more balanced mix of business at various insurance entities 
these transactions were eliminated in consolidation 
statutory reporting practices and other regulatory matters financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap differ in some respects from the statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities 
the most significant differences are as follows acquisition costs of obtaining new business are deferred and amortized over the approximate life of the policies rather than charged to operations as incurred  benefit liabilities are computed using a net level method and are based on realistic estimates of expected mortality  interest  and withdrawals as adjusted to provide for possible unfavorable deviation from such assumptions  deferred income taxes are not subject to statutory limitations as to amounts recognized and are recognized through earnings as opposed to being charged to shareowners equity  the asset valuation reserve and interest maintenance reserve are restored to shareowners equity  furniture and equipment  agents debit balances  and prepaid expenses are reported as assets rather than being charged directly to surplus referred to as nonadmitted assets  certain items of interest income  such as mortgage and bond discounts  are amortized differently  and bonds are recorded at their market values instead of amortized cost 
statutory net income for plico was million  million  and million for the year ended december   and  respectively 
statutory capital and surplus for plico was billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
the maximum amount that would qualify as ordinary dividends to the company from its insurance subsidiaries in is estimated to be million 
state insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners naic have adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks 
the requirements provide a means of measuring the minimum amount of statutory surplus appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations based on its size and risk profile 
a company s risk based statutory surplus is calculated by applying factors and performing calculations relating to various asset  premium  claim  expense and reserve items 
regulators can then measure the adequacy of a company s statutory surplus by comparing it to the rbc 
under rbc requirements  regulatory compliance is determined by the ratio of a company s total adjusted capital  as defined by the insurance regulators  to its company action level of rbc known as the rbc ratio  also as defined by insurance regulators 
as of december   the company s total adjusted capital and company action level rbc was billion and million  respectively  providing an rbc ratio of approximately 
as of december   the company s insurance subsidiaries had on deposit with regulatory authorities  fixed maturity and short term investments with a market value of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments the company determined the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in fasb guidance referenced in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the company has adopted the provisions from the fasb guidance that is referenced in the fair value measurements and disclosures topic for non financial assets and liabilities such as property and equipment  goodwill  and other intangible assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis 
the effect on the company s periodic fair value measurements for non financial assets and liabilities was not material 

table of contents the company has categorized its financial instruments  based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique  into a three level hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
if the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument 
financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized as follows level unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or significant inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include the following a quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets b quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets c inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable d inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means 
level prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
they reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability 

table of contents the following table presents the company s hierarchy for its assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of december  level level level total dollars in thousands assets fixed maturity securities available for sale residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities us government related securities state  municipalities  and political subdivisions other government related securities corporate bonds total fixed maturity securities available for sale fixed maturity securities trading residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities us government related securities state  municipalities  and political subdivisions other government related securities corporate bonds total fixed maturity securities trading total fixed maturity securities equity securities other long term investments short term investments total investments cash other assets assets related to separate acccounts variable annuity variable universal life total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis liabilities annuity account balances other liabilities total liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis includes certain freestanding and embedded derivatives

table of contents determination of fair values the valuation methodologies used to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities reflect market participant assumptions and are based on the application of the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable market inputs over unobservable inputs 
the company determines the fair values of certain financial assets and financial liabilities based on quoted market prices  where available 
the company also determines certain fair values based on future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate 
fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality  the company s credit standing  liquidity  and where appropriate  risk margins on unobservable parameters 
the following is a discussion of the methodologies used to determine fair values for the financial instruments as listed in the above table 
the fair value of fixed maturity  short term  and equity securities is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information third party pricing services  non binding independent broker quotations  or pricing matrices 
security pricing is applied using a waterfall approach whereby publicly available prices are first sought from third party pricing services  the remaining unpriced securities are submitted to independent brokers for non binding prices  or lastly  securities are priced using a pricing matrix 
typical inputs used by these three pricing methods include  but are not limited to benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  and reference data including market research publications 
third party pricing services price over of the company s fixed maturity securities 
based on the typical trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities  third party pricing services derive the majority of security prices from observable market inputs such as recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information outlined above 
if there are no recent reported trades  the third party pricing services and brokers may use matrix or model processes to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate 
certain securities are priced via independent non binding broker quotations  which are considered to have no significant unobservable inputs 
when using non binding independent broker quotations  the company obtains one quote per security  typically from the broker from which we purchased the security 
a pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the company is unable to obtain or effectively rely on either a price from a third party pricing service or an independent broker quotation 
the pricing matrix used by the company begins with current spread levels to determine the market price for the security 
the credit spreads  assigned by brokers  incorporate the issuer s credit rating  liquidity discounts  weighted average of contracted cash flows  risk premium  if warranted  due to the issuer s industry  and the security s time to maturity 
the company uses credit ratings provided by nationally recognized rating agencies 
for securities that are priced via non binding independent broker quotations  the company assesses whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through an analysis using internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads and  when available  market indices 
the company uses a market based cash flow analysis to validate the reasonableness of prices received from independent brokers 
these analytics  which are updated daily  incorporate various metrics yield curves  credit spreads  prepayment rates  etc 
to determine the valuation of such holdings 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the analytics  the price received from the independent broker is adjusted accordingly 
the company did not adjust any quotes or prices received from brokers during the year ended december  the company has analyzed the third party pricing services valuation methodologies and related inputs and has also evaluated the various types of securities in its investment portfolio to determine an appropriate fair value hierarchy level based upon trading activity and the observability of market inputs that is in accordance with the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the asc 
based on this evaluation and investment class analysis  each price was classified into level   or most prices 
table of contents provided by third party pricing services are classified into level because the significant inputs used in pricing the securities are market observable and the observable inputs are corroborated by the company 
since the matrix pricing of certain debt securities includes significant non observable inputs  they are classified as level asset backed securities this category mainly consists of residential mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  and other asset backed securities collectively referred to as asset backed securities or abs 
as of december   the company held billion of abs classified as level these securities are priced from information provided by a third party pricing service and independent broker quotes 
the third party pricing services and brokers mainly value securities using both a market and income approach to valuation 
as part of this valuation process they consider the following characteristics of the item being measured to be relevant inputs weighted average coupon rate  weighted average years to maturity  types of underlying assets  weighted average coupon rate of the underlying assets  weighted average years to maturity of the underlying assets  seniority level of the tranches owned  and credit ratings of the securities 
after reviewing these characteristics of the abs  the third party pricing service and brokers use certain inputs to determine the value of the security 
for abs classified as level  the valuation would consist of predominantly market observable inputs such as  but not limited to monthly principal and interest payments on the underlying assets  average life of the security  prepayment speeds  credit spreads  treasury and swap yield curves  and discount margin 
as of december   the company held million of level abs  which included million of other asset backed securities classified as trading 
these securities are predominantly ars whose underlying collateral is at least guaranteed by the ffelp 
as a result of the ars market collapse during  the company prices its ars using an income approach valuation model 
as part of the valuation process the company reviews the following characteristics of the ars in determining the relevant inputs weighted average coupon rate  weighted average years to maturity  types of underlying assets  weighted average coupon rate of the underlying assets  weighted average years to maturity of the underlying assets  seniority level of the tranches owned  and credit ratings of the securities 
the fair value calculation of available for sale abss classified as level had  but were not limited to  the following inputs investment grade credit rating weighted average yield par value million weighted average life years corporate bonds  us government related securities  states  municipals  and political subdivisions  and other government related securities as of december   the company classified approximately billion of corporate bonds  us government related securities  states  municipals  and political subdivisions  and other government related securities as level the fair value of the level bonds and securities is predominantly priced by broker quotes and a third party pricing service 
the company has reviewed the valuation techniques of the brokers and third party pricing service and has determined that such techniques used level market observable inputs 
the following characteristics of the bonds and securities are considered to be the primary relevant inputs to the valuation weighted average coupon rate  weighted average years to maturity  seniority  and credit ratings 

table of contents the brokers and third party pricing service utilize valuation models that consist of a hybrid income and market approach to valuation 
the pricing model utilizes the following inputs principal and interest payments  treasury yield curve  credit spreads from new issue and secondary trading markets  dealer quotes with adjustments for issues with early redemption features  liquidity premiums present on private placements  and discount margins from dealers in the new issue market 
as of december   the company classified approximately million of bonds and securities as level valuations 
the fair value of the level bonds and securities are derived from an internal pricing model that utilizes a hybrid market income approach to valuation 
the company reviews the following characteristics of the bonds and securities to determine the relevant inputs to use in the pricing model coupon rate  years to maturity  seniority  embedded options  trading volume  and credit ratings 
level bonds and securities primarily represent investments in illiquid bonds for which no price is readily available 
to determine a price  the company uses a discounted cash flow model with both observable and unobservable inputs 
these inputs are entered into an industry standard pricing model to determine the final price of the security 
these inputs include principal and interest payments  coupon rate  sector and issuer level spreads  underlying collateral  credit ratings  maturity  embedded options  recent new issuance  comparative bond analysis  and an illiquidity premium 
the fair value calculation of bonds and securities classified as level had  but were not limited to  the following weighted average inputs investment grade credit rating weighted average yield weighted average coupon par value million weighted average stated maturity years equities as of december   the company held approximately million of equity securities classified as level and level of this total  million represents federal home loan bank fhlb stock 
the company believes that the cost of the fhlb stock approximates fair value 
the remainder of these equity securities is primarily made up of holdings we have obtained through bankruptcy proceedings or debt restructurings 
other long term investments and other liabilities other long term investments and other liabilities consist entirely of free standing and embedded derivative financial instruments 
refer to note  derivative financial instruments for additional information related to derivatives 
derivative financial instruments are valued using exchange prices  independent broker quotations  or pricing valuation models  which utilize market data inputs 
excluding embedded derivatives  as of december   of derivatives based upon notional values were priced using exchange prices or independent broker quotations 
the remaining derivatives were priced by pricing valuation models  which predominantly utilize observable market data inputs 
inputs used to value derivatives include  but are not limited to  interest swap rates  credit spreads  interest rate and equity market volatility indices  equity index levels  and treasury rates 
the company performs monthly analysis on derivative valuations that includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses 
derivative instruments classified as level include futures  credit default swaps  and puts  which are traded on active exchange markets 

table of contents derivative instruments classified as level primarily include interest rate and inflation swaps 
these derivative valuations are determined using independent broker quotations  which are corroborated with observable market inputs 
derivative instruments classified as level were embedded derivatives and include at least one significant non observable input 
a derivative instrument containing level and level inputs will be classified as a level financial instrument in its entirety if it has at least one significant level input 
the company utilizes derivative instruments to manage the risk associated with certain assets and liabilities 
however  the derivative instruments may not be classified within the same fair value hierarchy level as the associated assets and liabilities 
therefore  the changes in fair value on derivatives reported in level may not reflect the offsetting impact of the changes in fair value of the associated assets and liabilities 
the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb embedded derivative is carried at fair value in other long term investments and other liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings as realized investment gains losses derivative financial instruments 
refer to note  derivative financial instruments for more information related to gmwb embedded derivative gains and losses 
the fair value of the gmwb embedded derivative is derived through the income method of valuation using a valuation model that projects future cash flows using multiple risk neutral stochastic equity scenarios and policyholder behavior assumptions 
the risk neutral scenarios are generated using the current swap curve and projected equity volatilities and correlations 
the projected equity volatilities are based on a blend of historical volatility and near term equity market implied volatilities 
the equity correlations are based on historical price observations 
for policyholder behavior assumptions  expected lapse and utilization assumptions are used and updated for actual experience  as necessary 
the company assumes age based mortality that is consistent with of the national association of insurance commissioners variable annuity gmdb mortality table 
the present value of the cash flows is determined using the discount rate curve  which is based upon libor plus a credit spread to represent the company s non performance risk 
as a result of using significant unobservable inputs  the gmwb embedded derivative is categorized as level these assumptions are reviewed on a quarterly basis 
the company has assumed and ceded certain blocks of policies under modified coinsurance agreements in which the investment results of the underlying portfolios inure directly to the reinsurers 
as a result  these agreements contain embedded derivatives that are reported at fair value 
changes in their fair value are reported in earnings 
the investments supporting these agreements are designated as trading securities  therefore changes in their fair value are also reported in earnings 
the fair value of the embedded is the difference between the policy liabilities  net of policy loans compared to the fair value of the trading securities 
as a result  changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives are largely offset by the changes in fair value of the related investments and each are reported in earnings 
annuity account balances the equity indexed annuity eia model calculates the present value of future benefit cash flows less the projected future profits to quantify the net liability that is held as a reserve 
this calculation is done using multiple risk neutral stochastic equity scenarios 
the cash flows are discounted using libor plus a credit spread 
best estimate assumptions are used for partial withdrawals  lapses  expenses and asset earned rate with a risk margin applied to each 
these assumptions are reviewed at least annually as a part of the formal unlocking process 
if an event were to occur within a quarter that would make the assumptions unreasonable  the assumptions would be reviewed within the quarter 

table of contents included in the chart below are current key assumptions which include risk margins for the company 
asset earned rate admin expense per policy to per policy partial withdrawal rate for ages less than partial withdrawal rate for ages and greater mortality of gmdb table lapse to depending on the surrender charge period return on assets to depending on the guarantee period the discount rate for the equity indexed annuities is based on an upward sloping rate curve which is updated each quarter 
the discount rates for december   ranged from a one month rate of  a year rate of  and a year rate of 
a credit spread component is also included in the calculation to accommodate non performance risk 
separate accounts separate account assets are invested in open ended mutual funds and are included in level

table of contents total realized and unrealized gains losses on level assets and liabilities are primarily reported in either realized investment gains losses within the consolidated statements of income loss or other comprehensive income loss within shareowners equity based on the appropriate accounting treatment for the item 
purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements  net  represent the activity that occurred during the period that results in a change of the asset or liability but does not represent changes in fair value for the instruments held at the beginning of the period 
such activity primarily relates to purchases and sales of fixed maturity securities and issuances and settlements of equity indexed annuities 
the company reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period 
changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities 
such reclassifications are reported as transfers in and out of level at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur 
the asset transfers in the table s above primarily related to positions moved from level to level as the company determined that certain inputs were observable 
the amount of total gains losses for assets and liabilities still held as of the reporting date primarily represents changes in fair value of trading securities and certain derivatives that exist as of the reporting date and the change in fair value of equity indexed annuities 
estimated fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the company s financial instruments as of the periods shown below are as follows as of december  carrying amounts fair values carrying amounts fair values dollars in thousands assets mortgage loans on real estate policy loans liabilities stable value product account balances annuity account balances mortgage loan backed certificates debt bank borrowings senior and medium term notes subordinated debt securities non recourse funding obligations except as noted below  fair values were estimated using quoted market prices 
fair value measurements mortgage loans on real estate the company estimates the fair value of mortgage loans using an internally developed model 
this model includes inputs derived by the company based on assumed discount rates relative to the company s current mortgage loan lending rate and an expected cash flow analysis based on a review of the mortgage loan terms 
the model also contains the company s determined representative risk adjustment assumptions related to nonperformance and liquidity risks 

table of contents policy loans the company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates book value 
policy loans are funds provided to policy holders in return for a claim on the policy 
the funds provided are limited to the cash surrender value of the underlying policy 
the nature of policy loans is to have a negligible default risk as the loans are fully collateralized by the value of the policy 
policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid either by the policyholder or with proceeds from the policy 
due to the collateralized nature of policy loans and unpredictable timing of repayments  the company believes the fair value of policy loans approximates carrying value 
stable value product and annuity account balances the company estimates the fair value of stable value product account balances and annuity account balances using models based on discounted expected cash flows 
the discount rates used in the models were based on a current market rate for similar financial instruments 
bank borrowings the company believes the carrying value of its bank borrowings approximates fair value 
non recourse funding obligations as of december   the company estimated the fair value of its non recourse funding obligations using internal discounted cash flow models 
the discount rates used in the model were based on a current market yield for similar financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies the company utilizes a risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate risk  inflation risk  currency exchange risk  volatility risk  and equity market risk 
these strategies are developed through the company s analysis of data from financial simulation models and other internal and industry sources  and are then incorporated into the company s risk management program 
derivative instruments expose the company to credit and market risk and could result in material changes from period to period 
the company attempts to minimize its credit risk by entering into transactions with highly rated counterparties 
the company manages the market risk by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degrees of risk that may be undertaken 
the company monitors its use of derivatives in connection with its overall asset liability management programs and risk management strategies 
in addition  all derivative programs are monitored by our risk management department 
derivatives related to interest rate risk management derivative instruments that are used as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps  interest rate futures  and interest rate caps 
the company s inflation risk management strategy involves the use of swaps that requires the company to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate that is based on changes in the consumer price index cpi 
derivatives related to risk mitigation of variable annuity contracts the company may use the following types of derivative contracts to mitigate its exposure to certain guaranteed benefits related to variable annuity contracts foreign currency futures 
table of contents variance swaps interest rate futures equity options equity futures credit derivatives interest rate swaps the company has sold credit protection under single name credit default swaps and credit default swap indices for which it receives a premium to insure credit risk 
such credit derivatives are a part of the company s program to mitigate risks related to certain minimum guaranteed benefits of variable annuity contracts and are designed to offset some portion of the company s nonperformance risk 
the company will only make a payment in the event there is a credit event 
a credit event payment will typically be equal to the notional value of the swap contract less an auction determined recovery rate  to the percentage extent described 
a credit event is generally defined to include material default  bankruptcy  or debt restructuring 
the company s maximum amount at risk  assuming the value of all referenced credit obligations is zero  equals the notional value of the credit default swaps 
as of december   the company did not have any open credit default swaps 
accounting for derivative instruments the company records its derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet in other long term investments and other liabilities in accordance with gaap  which requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet at fair value 
the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments is reported either in the statement of income or in other comprehensive income loss  depending upon whether it qualified for and also has been properly identified as being part of a hedging relationship  and also on the type of hedging relationship that exists 
for a derivative financial instrument to be accounted for as a gaap accounting hedge  it must be identified and documented either as a fair value  cash flow  or foreign currency gaap accounting hedge contemporaneously at the trade date 
for cash flow hedges  the effective portion of their realized gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction impacts earnings 
any remaining gain or loss  the ineffective portion  is recognized in current earnings 
for fair value hedge derivatives  their gain or loss as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings 
effectiveness of the company s hedge relationships is assessed on a quarterly basis 
the company reports changes in fair values of derivatives that are not part of a qualifying hedge relationship through earnings in the period of change 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are recognized in current earnings are reported in realized investment gains losses derivative financial instruments 
derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedging instruments cash flow hedges in connection with the issuance of inflation adjusted funding agreements  the company has entered into swaps to essentially convert the floating cpi linked interest rate on these agreements to a fixed rate 
the company pays a fixed rate on the swap and receives a floating rate primarily determined by the period s change in the cpi 
the amounts that are received on the swaps are almost equal to the amounts that are paid on the agreements 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap to convert libor based floating rate interest payments on a certain funding agreement to fixed rate interest payments 
this structure is basically the same as that described regarding the cpi based agreements and swaps 

table of contents derivative instruments not designated and not qualifying as hedging instruments the company uses various other derivative instruments for risk management purposes that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings during the period of change

an operating segment is distinguished by products  channels of distribution  and or other strategic distinctions 
the company periodically evaluates its operating segments  as prescribed in the asc segment reporting topic  and makes adjustments to its segment reporting as needed 
a brief description of each segment follows 
the life marketing segment markets ul  variable universal life  bank owned life insurance boli  and level premium term insurance traditional products on a national basis primarily through networks of independent insurance agents and brokers  stockbrokers  and independent marketing organizations 
the acquisitions segment focuses on acquiring  converting  and servicing policies acquired from other companies 
the segment s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals 
in the ordinary course of business  the acquisitions segment regularly considers acquisitions of blocks of policies or insurance companies 
the level of the segment s acquisition activity is predicated upon many factors  including available capital  operating capacity  potential return on capital  and market dynamics 
policies acquired through the acquisitions segment are typically closed blocks of business no new policies are being marketed 
therefore  earnings and account values are expected to decline as the result of lapses  deaths  and other terminations of coverage unless new acquisitions are made 
the annuities segment markets fixed and variable annuity products 
these products are primarily sold through broker dealers  financial institutions  and independent agents and brokers 
the stable value products segment sells fixed and floating rate funding agreements directly to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds  institutional investors  bank trust departments  and money market funds 
the segment also issues funding agreements to the federal home loan bank fhlb  and markets guaranteed investment contracts gics to k and other qualified retirement savings plans 
additionally  the company has contracts outstanding pursuant to a funding agreement backed notes program registered with the united states securities and exchange commission the sec which offered notes to both institutional and retail investors 
the asset protection segment markets extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers investments in automobiles  watercraft  and recreational vehicles 
in addition  the segment markets a guaranteed asset protection gap product 
gap coverage covers the difference between the loan pay off amount and an asset s actual cash value in the case of a total loss 
the corporate and other segment primarily consists of net investment income including the impact of carrying excess liquidity  expenses not attributable to the segments above including interest on certain corporate debt  and a trading portfolio that was previously part of a variable interest entity 
this segment includes earnings from several non strategic or runoff lines of business  various investment related transactions  the operations of several small subsidiaries  and the repurchase of non recourse funding obligations 

table of contents the company uses the same accounting policies and procedures to measure segment operating income loss and assets as it uses to measure consolidated net income available to plc s common shareowners and assets 
segment operating income loss is income before income tax excluding net realized investment gains and losses net of the related amortization of dac and voba and participating income from real estate ventures  and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
periodic settlements of derivatives associated with corporate debt and certain investments and annuity products are included in realized gains and losses but are considered part of operating income because the derivatives are used to mitigate risk in items affecting consolidated and segment operating income loss 
segment operating income loss represents the basis on which the performance of the company s business is internally assessed by management 
premiums and policy fees  other income  benefits and settlement expenses  and amortization of dac voba are attributed directly to each operating segment 
net investment income is allocated based on directly related assets required for transacting the business of that segment 
realized investment gains losses and other operating expenses are allocated to the segments in a manner that most appropriately reflects the operations of that segment 
investments and other assets are allocated based on statutory policy liabilities net of associated statutory policy assets  while dac voba and goodwill are shown in the segments to which they are attributable 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded a million decrease in reserves related to the final settlement in the runoff lender s indemnity line of business within the asset protection division 
during the first quarter of  the company recorded million of pre tax earnings in the corporate and other business segment relating to the settlement of a dispute with respect to certain investments
