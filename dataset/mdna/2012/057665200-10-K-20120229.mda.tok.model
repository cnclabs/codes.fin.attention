item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture  distribute and market specialty performance ingredients and products for the food  nutritional  pharmaceutical  animal health and medical device sterilization industries 
our reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer industrial products and services to different markets 
we presently have three reportable segments specialty products  food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
specialty products our specialty products segment operates in industry as arc specialty products 
ethylene oxide  at the level  is sold as a sterilant gas  primarily for use in the health care industry 
it is used to sterilize a wide range of medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or soft surfaces  composites  metals  tubing and different types of plastics without negatively impacting the performance of the device being sterilized 
our ethylene oxide product is distributed in uniquely designed  recyclable  double walled  stainless steel drums to assure compliance with safety  quality and environmental standards as outlined by the epa and the us department of transportation 
our inventory of these specially built drums  along with our two filling facilities  represents a significant capital investment 
contract sterilizers  medical device manufacturers  and medical gas distributors are our principal customers for this product 
in addition  we also sell single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical device sterilization 
as a fumigant  ethylene oxide blends are highly effective in killing bacteria  fungi  and insects in spices and other seasoning materials 
in  the company acquired aberco  inc  a marketer and distributor of propylene oxide 
we sell propylene oxide as a fumigant to aid in the control of insects and microbiological spoilage  and to reduce bacterial and mold contamination in shell and processed nut meats except peanuts  processed spices  cacao beans  cocoa powder  raisins  figs and prunes 
we also sell propylene oxide to customers seeking smaller as opposed to bulk quantities and whose requirements include utilization in various chemical synthesis applications  to make paints more durable and for manufacturing specialty starches and textile coatings 
management believes that future success in this segment is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality  safety and customer service 
food  pharma nutrition the food  pharma nutrition fpn segment provides microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food  pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification  processing  mixing  and packaging applications and shelf life 
major product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends  confections  and nutritional supplements 
we also market human grade choline nutrient products through this segment for wellness applications 
choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants  processing dietary fat  reproductive development and neural functions  such as memory and muscle function 
the fpn portfolio also includes a novel smooth dissolve excipient technology  primarily used in chewable tablets or stick pack dosage forms for nutritional and pharmaceutical products 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food and nutrition markets by the company s customers and prospects 
the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and innovative needs 
animal nutrition health our animal nutrition health anh segment provides the animal nutrition market with nutritional products derived from our microencapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to basic choline chloride 
commercial sales of reashure choline  an encapsulated choline product  nitroshuretm  an encapsulated urea supplement  and niashuretm  our microencapsulated niacin product for dairy cows  boosts health and milk production in transition and lactating dairy cows  delivering nutrient supplements that survive the rumen and are biologically available  providing required nutritional levels 
we also market chelated mineral supplements for use in animal feed throughout the world  as our proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals 
in october  we introduced the first proven rumen protected lysine for use in dairy rations  aminoshure l  which gives nutritionists and dairy producers a precise and consistent source of rumen protected lysine 
anh also manufactures and supplies basic choline chloride  an essential nutrient for animal health  predominantly to the poultry and swine industries 
choline  which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms  plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat 
choline deficiency can result in reduced growth and perosis in poultry  fatty liver  kidney necrosis and general poor health condition in swine 
certain derivatives of choline chloride are also manufactured and sold into industrial applications predominately as a component for hydraulic fracturing of shale natural gas wells 
the anh segment also includes the manufacture and sale of methylamines 
methylamines are a primary building block for the manufacture of choline products and are also used in a wide range of industrial applications 
sales of specialty products for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of university research on the animal health benefits of the company s products 
management believes that success in the commodity oriented basic choline chloride marketplace is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service 
in addition  the company must continue to increase production efficiencies in order to maintain its low cost position to effectively compete in a highly competitive global marketplace 
the company sells products for all three segments through its own sales force  independent distributors  and sales agents

historical cash payments made under such plan have typically been less than per year 
critical accounting policies management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenue for each of our business segments is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss  and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are principally not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
in instances of shipments made on consignment  revenue is deferred until a customer indicates to the company that it has used the company s products 
the company does not charge its customers rental fees on cylinders or drums used to ship its products 
in addition  the company follows the provisions of asc topic  revenue recognition incorporating the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  payments and customer acceptance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories 
the write down of potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is recorded based on management s assumptions about future demand and market conditions long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is assessed annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of its goodwill to its carrying value 
we also perform impairment analyses whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or certain intangibles may be impaired 
in accordance with the asc topic  we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we utilize our three operating segments as our goodwill reporting units as we have discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management and businesses within each segment have similar economic characteristics 
for the year ended december   the company s three reporting units were specialty products  food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health 
for the year ended december   as permitted by asc topic  we have assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts  including goodwill  as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december   which indicated that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are less than their respective carrying amounts  including goodwill 
therefore  no further testing was necessary 
prior to  we had historically assessed the fair value of our reporting units by solely utilizing the income approach  based on a discounted cash flow valuation model as the basis for our conclusions 
our estimates of future cash flows included significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates  estimated terminal value and future economic and market conditions 
for the year ended december   with the exception of an asset writedown related to the sale of a product line  there were no triggering events which required asset impairment reviews and the undiscounted cash flows associated with our property  plant and equipment and other long lived intangible assets were well in excess of the carrying value of these asset classes 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  china and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
post employment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits  the company is required to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing asc asc clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by a tax authority 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosures 
the application of asc requires judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of the options is based on the company s historical experience of employees exercise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period
