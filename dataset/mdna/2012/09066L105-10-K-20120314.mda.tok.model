item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide information necessary to understand our audited consolidated financial statements for the two year period ended december   and highlight certain other information which  in the opinion of management  will enhance a reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
in particular  the discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant trends and material changes in our financial position and the operating results of our business during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   and during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements for the two year period ended december  and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing  particularly in item a 
risk factors 
stem cells and products for regenerative medicine research we are marketing our stem cell products for research through our website biotimeinc 
com 
by an agreement with recyte therapeutics  millipore corporation became a worldwide distributor of certain actcellerate hepc lines and related espan growth media 
these lines are being marketed and distributed on a worldwide basis 
the actcellerate hepc lines and espan growth media products distributed by millipore may also be purchased directly from us on our website biotimeinc 
com 
in addition to the products that we are co marketing with millipore  we now offer other actcellerate hepc lines for sale on our website  and we anticipate adding additional cell lines and related espan growth media and differentiation kits over time 
we are also offering actcellerate hepcs and espan growth media in asia through biotime asia s distribution agreement with genext 
we have acquired from rgi an array of hes cell lines carrying inherited genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy 
study of these cell lines will enable researchers to better understand the mechanisms involved in causing their corresponding disease states  which may in turn expedite the search for potential treatments 
we have also targeted for development espy cell lines  which will be derivatives of hes cells that will emit beacons of light 
these light emitting cells will allow researchers to track the location and distribution of the cells in both in vitro and in vivo studies 
as new products are developed  they will become available for purchase on biotimeinc

plasma volume expander products royalties and licensing fees related to our plasma volume expander products  primarily hextend  comprise a significant part of our operating revenues 
hextend has become the standard plasma volume expander at a number of prominent teaching hospitals and leading medical centers and is part of the tactical combat casualty care protocol of the us armed forces 
under our license agreements  hospira and cj will report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 
royalties on sales of hextend that occurred during the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in our financial statements for the year ended december  we received  in royalties from hextend sales by hospira during royalties for decreased from  in royalties from hospira on hextend sales in in addition  we received royalties from cj in the amount of  for the period ended december   representing a increase from  in royalties received for the period ended december  based on sales of hextend that occurred during the fourth quarter of  we received royalties of  from hospira and  from cj during the first quarter of total royalties of  for the quarter decreased from royalties of  received during the same period last year 
these royalties will be reflected in our financial statements for the first quarter of the decrease in royalties received from hospira based on sales during is generally due to the rapid decline in the price of hetastarch products  including hextend in the market 
the blood volume expander marketing is shrinking overall and hospitals have shifted their purchases to albumin products 
hospira has reported that they have seen a rapid decline in the price of hetastarch based plasma expanders in the market which could continue to have a possible negative impact on royalties from the sales of hextend 
hospira has implemented further price reductions for hextend during in an attempt to maintain market share 

table of contents during the year ended december   we received  from summit for the right to co develop hextend and pentalyte in japan  china  and taiwan 
a portion of the cash payment is a partial reimbursement of biotime s development costs of hextend and a portion is a partial reimbursement of biotime s development costs of pentalyte 
this payment is reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue 
research and development programs in regenerative medicine and stem cell research we entered the fields of stem cell research and regenerative medicine during october from that time through  our activities in those fields included acquiring rights to market stem cell lines  pursuing patents  planning future products and research programs  applying for research grants  identifying the characteristics of various acquired progenitor and stem cell lines  negotiating a product distribution agreement  organizing new subsidiaries to address particular fields of product development  and planning and launching our first product development programs

lifemap was organized during april 
table of contents the inherent uncertainties of developing new products for stem cell research and for medical use make it impossible to predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to complete the development and commence commercialization of new products 
there is no assurance that we or any of our subsidiaries will be successful in developing new technologies or stem cell products  or that any technology or products that may be developed will be proven safe and effective for treating diseases in humans  or will be successfully commercialized 
most of our potential therapeutic products are at a very early stage of preclinical development 
before any clinical trials can be conducted by us or any of our subsidiaries  the company seeking to conduct the trials would have to compile sufficient laboratory test data substantiating the characteristics and purity of the stem cells  conduct animal studies  and then obtain all necessary regulatory and clinical trial site approvals  after which a team of physicians and statisticians would need to be assembled to perform the trials 
clinical trials will be costly to undertake and will take years to complete 
see our discussion of the risks inherent in our business and the impact of government regulation on our business in the risk factors section and business section of this report

table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition we comply with sec staff accounting bulletin guidance on revenue recognition 
royalty and license fee revenues consist of product royalty payments and fees under license agreements and are recognized when earned and reasonably estimable 
we recognize revenue in the quarter in which the royalty reports are received rather than the quarter in which the sales took place 
when we are entitled to receive up front nonrefundable licensing or similar fees pursuant to agreements under which we have no continuing performance obligations  the fees are recognized as revenues when collection is reasonably assured 
when we receive up front nonrefundable licensing or similar fees pursuant to agreements under which we do have continuing performance obligations  the fees are deferred and amortized ratably over the performance period 
if the performance period cannot be reasonably estimated  we amortize nonrefundable fees over the life of the contract until such time that the performance period can be more reasonably estimated 
milestone payments  if any  related to scientific or technical achievements are recognized in income when the milestone is accomplished if a substantive effort was required to achieve the milestone  b the amount of the milestone payment appears reasonably commensurate with the effort expended  and c collection of the payment is reasonably assured 
grant income is recognized as revenue when earned 
patent costs costs associated with obtaining patents on products or technology developed are expensed as general and administrative expenses when incurred 
this accounting is in compliance with guidance promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
research and development we comply with fasb requirements governing accounting for research and development costs 
research and development costs are expensed when incurred  and consist principally of salaries  payroll taxes  consulting fees  research and laboratory fees  and license fees paid to acquire patents or licenses to use patents and other technology from third parties 
stock based compensation we have adopted accounting standards governing share based payments  which require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to directors and employees  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes merton option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury rates in effect during the corresponding period of grant 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with recent fasb guidance  changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value 
in management s opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options because the option pricing model value may not be indicative of the fair value that would be established in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
treasury stock we account for biotime common shares issued to subsidiaries for future potential working capital needs as treasury stock on the consolidated balance sheet 
we have the intent and ability to register any unregistered shares to support the marketability of the shares 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
deferred license and consulting fees deferred license and consulting fees consist of the value of warrants issued to third parties for services and to the minority shareholder in biotime asia for its participation in the organization of that company  and deferred license fees paid to acquire rights to use the proprietary technologies of third parties 
the value of the warrants is being amortized over the lives of the warrants  and deferred license fees over the estimated useful lives of the licensed technologies or licensed research products 
the estimation of the useful life any technology or product involves a significant degree of inherent uncertainty  since the outcome of research and development or the commercial life of a new product cannot be known with certainty at the time that the right to use the technology or product is acquired 
we will review its amortization schedules for impairments that might occur earlier than the original expected useful lives

table of contents results of operations under our license agreements with hospira and cj  our licensees report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place

the decrease in royalties received from hospira based on sales during is generally due to the rapid decline in the price of hetastarch based products in the market 
the blood volume expander marketing is shrinking overall and hospitals have shifted their purchases to albumin products 
hospira has reported that they have seen a rapid decline in the price of hetastarch based plasma expanders in the market which could continue to have a negative impact on revenues from the sale of hextend 
hospira has implemented further price reductions for hextend during in an attempt to maintain market share 
we recognized as revenue  and  of license fees from cj and summit during and  respectively 
the license fees were received from cj during april and july  and from summit during december and april and october of  but full recognition of the license fees has been deferred  and is being recognized over the life of the contract  which has been estimated to last until approximately based on the current expected life of the governing patent covering our products in korea and japan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we received four quarterly payments totaling  from our research grant from cirm during the year ended december  because grant income is recognized as revenue when earned  and these amounts received covered the period of march  through february   only  of the cirm grant earned during the fiscal year was recognized in our consolidated financial statements and the balance will be recognized as revenue during the first quarter of total grant income from cirm recognized during the year amounted to  which includes  of a payment received in that was recognized as revenues in in  grant income included  of a  grant awarded by the nih 
the grant period runs from september  through september  grant income also included awards from other sources in the amount of  recognized through cell cure neurosciences and  through oncocyte and orthocyte during 
table of contents research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  increase is partially attributed to the increase in research and development expenses incurred by esi and cell cure neurosciences to  in compared to  in the increase from prior year is primarily attributed to full year s worth of activity in compared to eight months and three months for esi and cell cure neurosciences  respectively in these amounts include  in and  in of amortization expense of patent technology acquired from the acquisition of those subsidiaries in may and october  respectively 
furthermore  in  research and development expenses also included  in amortization expense related to the patent technology acquired from cti in jan and through the acquisition of glycosan in march aside from these expenses  the increase in research and development expense during is primarily attributable to an increase of  in employee compensation and related costs allocated to research and development expense  an increase of  in outside research and laboratory costs  an increase of  in stock based compensation allocated to research and development expense of which  arises from cell cure neurosciences  an increase of  in expenditures made to cover laboratory expenses and supplies  an increase of  in rent expenses allocated to research and development expense  an increase of  for patent related legal expenses  an increase of  in depreciation expenses allocated to research and development expense  and  in expenses related to the hystem rx project  a new project in these increases were offset to some extent by decreases of  in scientific consulting fees 
research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  patent and technology license fees  employee salaries and benefits  stock compensation expense  rent  insurance and science related consultants fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  increase is partially attributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses incurred by cell cure neurosciences to  in compared to  in  which we acquired in october of the general and administrative expenses for esi decreased to  in compared to  in  although acquired in may this decrease is largely attributed to certain non recurring audit and accounting fees incurred in in connection with the acquisition of approximately  and further attributed to the recognition of bad debt expense of approximately  there were no such expenses in excluding these non recurring expenses  general and administrative expenses for esi increased by approximately  the overall increase is further attributable to increase of  in employee compensation  bonuses and related costs allocated to general and administrative expense  an increase of  in consulting fees  an increase of  in stock based compensation to employees and consultants  an increase of  in cash and stock based compensation paid to our independent directors  an increase of  in travel  lodging and entertainment expense  an increase in recruiting and hiring expense of  an increase of  in stock subscription  registration and agent fees  marketing and advertisement expenses of  an increase of  in bad debt expense and an increase of  in rent expenses allocated to general and administrative expense 
these increases were offset to some extent by decreases of  in investor and public relations fees 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits allocated to general and administrative accounts  stock compensation expense  consulting fees other than those paid for science related consulting  expenditures for patent costs  trademark expenses  insurance costs allocated to general and administrative expenses  stock exchange related costs  depreciation expense  shipping expenses  marketing costs  and other miscellaneous expenses 
year ended december  and year ended december  our royalty revenues for the year ended december  consist of royalties on sales of hextend made by hospira and cj during the period beginning october  and ending september  royalty revenues recognized for that period were  compared with  recognized for the year ended december  this decrease in royalties is attributable to a decrease in hextend sales in the us  which was slightly offset by an increase in sales in the republic of korea 
the decrease in sales in the us market was primarily due to a decrease in sales to the us armed forces 
purchases by the armed forces generally take the form of intermittent  large volume orders  and cannot be predicted with certainty 
hospira has reported that the armed forces shifted primary point of use of hextend from the field to the hospital level  which may account for some decrease in overall sales 
this change was made due to the fact that too much of the product was being distributed to ground troops for inclusion in field packs and was going unused beyond the expiration date  so a different pattern of distribution was deemed advisable 
we recognized as revenue  and  of license fees from cj and summit during and  respectively 
the license fees were received from cj during april and july  and from summit during december and april and october of  but full recognition of the license fees has been deferred  and is being recognized over the life of the contract  which has been estimated to last until approximately based on the current expected life of the governing patent covering our products in korea and japan

table of contents we received four quarterly payments totaling  from our research grant from cirm during the year ended december  because grant income is recognized as revenue when earned  and these amounts received covered the period of march  through february   only  earned during the fiscal year was recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
total grant income recognized during the year amounted to  which includes  of a payment received in but that was recognized as revenues in we received  of the  grant awarded to us under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp 
the remainder of the award was received in february the qtdp was part of the patient protection and affordable care act signed into law on march  the grants awarded biotime were for the maximum amount allowed for three of our programs orthopedic product development  our actcellerate platform  and our recyte ips program 
we also recognized  of grant income from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry  trade  and labor of israel during through our ownership interest in cell cure neurosciences 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  for  research and development expenses also included  of research and development expense incurred by esi and cell cure neurosciences  of which  is derived from the amortization of patent technology related to our acquisition of those subsidiaries during the year 
also  during the year ended december   biotime modified its procedure for amortizing deferred license fees 
as a result  research and development expenses for include  of amortization of deferred license fees of which  represents amortization of deferred license fees not previously recorded in and aside from those expenses  the increase in research and development expense during is primarily attributable to an increase of  in employee compensation and related costs allocated to research and development expense  an increase of  in scientific consulting fees  an increase of  in stock based compensation allocated to research and development expense  an increase of  of travel and related costs allocated to research and development expenses  an increase of  in outside research and laboratory costs  an increase of  in expenditures made to cover laboratory expenses and supplies and an increase of  in patent related legal fees 
the increase in the amount we spent on research and development during reflects in part the greater amount of grant payments we received during compared to research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  patent and technology license fees  employee salaries and benefits  stock compensation expense  rent  insurance and science related consultants fees 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  for  general and administrative expenses also included  of general and administrative expense incurred by esi and cell cure neurosciences  which we acquired during the year 
the increase is further attributable to increase of  in employee compensation  bonuses and related costs allocated to general and administrative expense   in stock appreciation rights compensation liability  an increase of  in cash and stock based compensation paid to our independent directors  an increase of  in legal fees  an increase of  in consulting and outside services related  an increase of  in accounting fees  an increase of  in investor and public relations expenses and an increase of  in travel  lodging and entertainment expense 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits allocated to general and administrative accounts  stock compensation expense  consulting fees other than those paid for science related consulting  expenditures for patent costs  trademark expenses  insurance costs allocated to general and administrative expenses  stock exchange related costs  depreciation expense  shipping expenses  marketing costs  and other miscellaneous expenses 

table of contents interest and other income expense during  we earned  of interest income  net of of interest expense 
interest income is generally attributed to interest earned on higher cash balances held during compared to our interest expense decreased by approximately million during compared to  primarily due to full repayment of our borrowings under the various lines of credit in during  we recognized  in costs for the modification of stock purchase warrants that expired on november  we offered a discounted exercise price of per share to the holders of the warrants with an original strike price of per share 
the warrant discount offer commenced on june   and expired at pm  new york time  on august  taxes at december  we had a cumulative net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for federal income tax purposes and  for state income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate because we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  as we do not consider realization to be more likely than not 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had  of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we may need to obtain additional debt or equity capital in order to finance our operations 
since inception  we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  licensing fees  royalties on product sales by our licensees  and borrowings 
the amount of revenue that may be earned through the licensing and sale of our products and technology  the timing of the receipt of license fee and royalty payments  and the future availability and terms of equity financing  are uncertain 
although we have recently been awarded research grants from cirm  qtdp  and nih for particular projects  and our subsidiary cell cure neurosciences has received research grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry  trade and labor in israel  we must finance our other research and operations with funding from other sources 
we presently have issued and outstanding  common share purchase warrants  of which  are exercisable at a price of per share and  at per share 
these warrants expire on various dates ranging from september to may none of the warrants are publicly traded 
the unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force us to modify  curtail  delay  or suspend some or all aspects of our planned operations 
sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders 
cash generated by operations during  we received  of cash in our operations 
our sources of that cash were  of royalty revenues from hospira   of royalty revenues from cj   of research grant payment from the nih  a  payment from a qtdp research grant   from the sale of research products   in foreign grants  and a  research grant payment from cirm 
cash used in operations during  our total research and development expenditures were  and our general and administrative expenditures were  net loss for the year ended december  amounted to  net cash used in operating activities during this period amounted to  the difference between the net loss and net cash used in operating activities during was primarily attributable to amortization of  in intangible assets   in stock based compensation paid to employees and consultants   in options issued as independent director compensation   amortization of deferred consulting fees   amortization of deferred license fees   in amortization of deferred rent   in depreciation expense  established a  allowance for uncollectible accounts   in grant receivable  and  in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
this overall difference was offset to some extent by amortization of  in deferred license revenues   in accounts receivable   in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and net loss of  allocable to the noncontrolling interest in our subsidiaries 
cash flows from investing activities during the year ended december    was used for investing activities 
the primary components of this cash were approximately  used in the purchase of equipment and  used in the acquisition of cti 
this cash expenditure was offset to some extent by  of cash acquired in connection with the asset purchase transaction with cti and the merger with glycosan 

table of contents cash generated by financing activities during the year ended december    in net cash was provided from our financing activities 
during this period  we received  in connection with the exercise of  options   in connection with the exercise of  warrants   from issuance of recyte therapeutics common shares  and  in cash from the sale of oncocyte common stock 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases this table does not include payments to key employees that could arise if they were involuntary terminated or if their employment terminated following a change in control 
includes the lease of our principal office and laboratory facilities in alameda  california  and leases of the offices and laboratory facilities of our subsidiaries esi  lifemap  and cell cure neurosciences 
recent financing activities during august  oncocyte sold  shares of common stock to a private investor who is also a biotime shareholder for  in cash  and oncocyte sold to us  shares of oncocyte common stock for  in cash and  biotime common shares having a market value of  these biotime common shares are accounted for as treasury stock as of december  future capital needs we currently depend upon revenue from the sale of our stem cell research products  hystem hydrogel for research use  royalties from the sale of hextend by hospira and cj  and our research grants from cirm  sbir and the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of industry  trade  and labor of israel 
any significant loss in any of these revenue sources could impact our future capital needs 
our product sales and royalty revenues may be supplemented by any license fees that we may receive if we enter into new commercial license agreements for our products or technology 
the amount and pace of research and development that we do or sponsor  and our ability to commence and complete the clinical trials that are required in order for us to obtain fda and foreign regulatory approval of products  are highly dependent upon the amount of capital we have 
future research and clinical study costs are not presently determinable due to many factors  including the inherent uncertainty of these costs and the uncertainty as to timing  source  and amount of capital that will become available for our projects 
the market value and the volatility of our stock price  as well as general market conditions  could impact our ability to raise capital on favorable terms  or at all 
any equity financing we obtain may further dilute or otherwise impair the ownership interests of our current shareholders 
if we fail to generate positive cash flows or fail to obtain additional capital when required  we could modify  delay or abandon some or all of our programs 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to some foreign exchange currency risks because we have subsidiaries that are located in foreign countries 
we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations have an impact on our financial results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is mitigated by the fact that our foreign subsidiaries pay their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currency 
as of december   currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our intercompany transactions with our foreign subsidiaries 
most of the foreign exchange loss reflected on our statement of operations reflects the impact of foreign exchange rates on amortization of assets held by our foreign subsidiaries  rather than transactional costs

deposits with banks may temporarily exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
we monitor the cash balances in our accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the federally insured amount at a bank  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail 
our foreign subsidiaries deposit their cash in local banks  but if the amount of a deposit at any time exceeds the amount at a bank under the national banking insurance laws  the uninsured portion of the deposit could be lost  in whole or in part  if the bank were to fail
