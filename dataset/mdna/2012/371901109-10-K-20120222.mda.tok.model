liquidity and capital resources the company s financial condition throughout the periods presented has remained very strong  in spite of general economic conditions and conditions in our primary industry which  even though improved  have not necessarily fully recovered 
the company s current ratio decreased from as of december   to as of december   primarily as a result of the increase in accounts payable  partially offset by an increase in inventory 
cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december   increased  to  compared to  for the same period last year  primarily due to increased net income  partially offset by changes in working capital 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   increased to  compared to  for the same period last year  primarily due to increased production equipment purchases and land purchases  as well as building improvement related costs incurred given improved automotive industry conditions 
during  land  building improvement related costs were approximately  in light of customer demand for our auto dimming mirrors and more complex product mix  the company currently anticipates that capital expenditures will be approximately million  primarily due to increased production equipment purchases of million and new facility related costs of approximately million to increase production plant capacity 
capital expenditures will be financed from current cash and cash equivalents on hand 
the company previously announced the following expansion plans to increase its plant capacity in the electronic assembly  final assembly  rcd and exterior mirror manufacturing areas 
the projects include  square foot chemistry lab expansion at the company s zeeland  michigan campus  which is expected to be completed in early with a total estimated cost of approximately million

 square foot expansion project connecting two of its manufacturing facilities in zeeland  michigan  which is expected to be completed in the second half of with a total estimated cost of approximately million 
the company incurred approximately million in facility related costs pertaining to the above projects in the remaining million in facility costs pertaining to the above projects are expected to be incurred in the company is also evaluating additional manufacturing capacity needs to support the demand for its products 
due to the current volatile economic environment  as well as uncertainties related to the timing of the ramp up of certain products  the construction timing of a new facility is uncertain 
however  the company is estimating that it will incur costs of approximately million pertaining to facility master planning and land infrastructure improvements at a acre site that the company currently owns 
the company is also evaluating additional facility needs in germany to support its growing european business 
however  the timing of the additional facility needs are uncertain due to the current volatile economic environment 
short term investments as of december   decreased approximately  compared to december   primarily due to fixed income investment maturities 
accounts receivable as of december   increased approximately  compared to december   primarily due the higher sales levels 
inventories as of december   increased approximately  compared to december   primarily due to higher sales and production levels in conjunction with longer lead times for certain electronic component raw materials inventory and the need to have safety stock given certain supply chain constraints 
accounts payable as of december   increased approximately  compared to december   primarily due to increased production levels and capital expenditures 
management considers the company s working capital of approximately  and long term investments of approximately  at december   together with internally generated cash flow and an unsecured  line of credit demand note from a bank  to be sufficient to cover anticipated cash needs for the next year and for the foreseeable future  considering its contract obligations and other commitments

as a result of the fast ramp up in global automotive light vehicle production in the second half of and the continuation through calendar year  the company experienced increased costs associated with supply chain constraints on certain automotive grade electronic components 
although availability of certain automotive grade components remained tight throughout this period  the company did experience continued sequential improvement in this area through however  the march   earthquake and tsunami in japan added significant stresses on the supply chain  as many electronic components are supplied by japanese manufacturers who were impacted by the natural disaster 
the company was successful in securing additional quantities of constrained parts to meet anticipated customer demand  which is reflected in current inventory levels 
in addition  the company did experience sequential reductions in supply chain related costs through the balance of calendar year as conditions improved following the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
flooding in thailand as a result of heavy rain and monsoons since late july resulted in additional supply chain disruptions as production at certain component supplier plants was moved to their plants in other countries  putting those suppliers outside of thailand in over capacity situations 
gaining access to those components resulted in additional costs to the company and negatively impacted the company s gross profit margin by approximately of one percentage point during the fourth quarter of the company currently believes that  barring another natural disaster impacting the supply chain  the costs associated with these supply chain constraints disruptions will sequentially improve through the first half of calendar year to date  the supply chain related issues the company has experienced have not disrupted deliveries to customers  but the company continues to apply measures to ensure adequate supply of certain automotive grade components that have been affected by recent economic and environmental conditions  including carrying additional inventory 
the current environment is constantly changing and it is not known what the ultimate effect of the changing environment will be on the supply chain  global light vehicle production  the auto industry or the company 
the company continued to add temporary contract workers  direct hire hourly workers and technical salaried positions to meet increased demand for its products as the automotive production environment and global economic conditions improved throughout and into the company also utilized overtime and third shift production to meet increased production schedules 
the company utilizes the light vehicle production forecasting services of ihs worldwide  and ihs current forecasts for light vehicle production for the first quarter of are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 
current forecasts for light vehicle production for calendar are approximately million units for north america  million for europe and million for japan and korea 
the company currently estimates that top line revenue will increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in based on the current ihs forecast for light vehicle production levels and our anticipated product mix 
these estimates are based on light vehicle production forecasts in the regions to which the company ships product  as well as the estimated option rates for its mirrors on prospective vehicle models and anticipated product mix 
continuing uncertainties  including light vehicle production levels  supply chain disruptions  supplier part shortages  automotive plant shutdowns  sales rates in asia  europe and north america  customer inventory management  and the impact of potential automotive customer including their tier suppliers and supplier bankruptcies  work stoppages  strikes  etc  which could disrupt shipments to these customers  make forecasting difficult 
due to significant uncertainties with global vehicle production volumes  it is an extremely difficult environment to forecast  and as a result  the company is not providing revenue estimates beyond the first quarter of at this time 
the company also estimates that engineering  research and development expenses are currently expected to increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to additional hiring of employee and outside contract engineering development services 
in addition  the company estimates that selling  general and administrative expenses are currently expected to increase approximately in the first quarter of compared with the same period in  primarily due to increased overseas office expenses 
based on the current ihs forecast for light vehicle production levels for the entire year  the company currently estimates that smartbeam unit shipments will increase approximately in calendar year compared with calendar year the company currently believes that there are too many uncertainties to provide annual guidance for rcd mirror unit shipments at this time reflecting the extended wait and see due to the pending final rules pertaining to the kids transportation safety act of refer to the auto dimming rearview mirrors section in part i  item for additional details and the lack of visibility with respect to customer sourcing decisions 
many automakers have taken a wait and see approach to decide how to comply with the act until all rule making is final 
as a result  based on the current ihs forecast for light vehicle production levels  we currently estimate that rcd mirror unit shipments will increase approximately for the first quarter of compared with the same prior year quarter 
the company is not providing any other estimates at this time 
the company does not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements or commitments that have not been recorded in it consolidated financial statements 
see the contractual obligations and other commitments below 
market risk disclosure the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including foreign exchange rate risk  interest rate risk and equity price risk 
the company has some assets  liabilities and operations outside the united states  including a euro denominated account  which currently are not significant 
because the company sells its automotive mirrors throughout the world and automobile manufacturing is highly dependent on general economic conditions  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
most of the company s non us sales are invoiced and paid in non us dollars  during  approximately of the company s net sales were invoiced and paid in foreign currencies compared to for and for 
the company currently expects that approximately of the company s net sales in will be invoiced and paid in foreign currencies 
the reduction in foreign currency denominated sales since was the result of a major customer in europe switching certain programs back from euro denominated sales to us dollars 
the company does not currently engage in hedging activities 
the company manages interest rate risk and default risk in its fixed income investment portfolio by investing in shorter term maturities and investment grade issues 
the company s fixed income investments maturities at fair value  and average interest rates are as follows september  september  september  september  september  september  total balance as of december  us government amount average interest rate government agency amount average interest rate certificates of deposit amount average interest rate corporate bonds amount average interest rate other amount average interest rate after tax most of the company s equity investments are managed by a number of outside equity fund managers who invest primarily in large capitalization companies on the us stock markets

critical accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies described below represent those that are broadly applicable to its operations and involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related amounts 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized based on the terms of the customer purchase order that indicates title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the customer upon shipment 
sales are shown net of returns  which have not historically been significant 
the company does not generate sales from sale arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accounts receivable 
the company reviews a monthly aging report of all accounts receivable balances starting with invoices outstanding over sixty days 
in addition  the company monitors information about its customers through a variety of sources including the media  and information obtained through on going interaction between company personnel and the customer 
based on the evaluation of the above information  the company estimates its allowances related to customer receivables on historical credit and collections experience  customers current financial condition and the specific identification of other potential problems  including the economic climate 
actual collections can differ  requiring adjustments to the allowances  but such adjustments have not  historically  been material 
inventories 
estimated inventory allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories are based on current assessments of future demands  market conditions  evaluation of longer lead times for certain electronic components and related management initiatives 
if market conditions or customer requirements change and are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory allowances are adjusted accordingly 
investments 
the company s internal investment committee regularly reviews its fixed income and equity investment portfolio for any unrealized losses that would be deemed other than temporary and require the recognition of an impairment loss in income 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  the company evaluates  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
management also considers the type of security  related industry  sector performance  as well as published investment ratings and analyst reports to evaluate its portfolio 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions continue to deteriorate  the company may incur future impairments 
self insurance 
the company is self insured for health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes 
the company applies the provisions of asc as it relates to uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements 
a threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination is applied to uncertain tax positions 
the company deems the estimates related to this provision to be reasonable  however  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not vary from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc the company utilizes the black scholes model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating a the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  b the volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term  c the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures and d expected dividends 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized on the consolidated condensed statements of operations
