pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement  the china net bvi shareholders transferred to us all of the china net bvi shares in exchange for the issuance of  shares the exchange shares in the aggregate of our common stock the share exchange 
as a result of the share exchange  china net bvi became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are now a holding company which  through certain contractual arrangements with operating companies in the people s republic of china the prc  is engaged in providing advertising  marketing  communication and brand management and sales channel building services to small and medium companies in china 
our wholly owned subsidiary  china net bvi  was incorporated in the british virgin islands on august  on april   china net bvi became the parent holding company of a group of companies comprised of cnet online technology limited  a hong kong company china net hk  which established  and is the parent company of  rise king century technology development beijing co  ltd  a wholly foreign owned enterprise wfoe established in the prc rise king wfoe 
we refer to the transactions that resulted in china net bvi becoming an indirect parent company of rise king wfoe as the offshore restructuring 
prc regulations prohibit direct foreign ownership of business entities providing internet content  or icp services in the prc  and restrict foreign ownership of business entities engaging in the advertising business 
in october  a series of contractual arrangements the contractual agreements or the vie agreements were entered between rise king wfoe and business opportunity online beijing network technology co  ltd 
business opportunity online  beijing cnet online advertising co  ltd 
beijing cnet online collectively the prc operating entities and its common individual owners the prc shareholders or the control group 
the contractual agreements allowed china net bvi through rise king wfoe to  among other things  secure significant rights to influence the prc operating entities business operations  policies and management  approve all matters requiring shareholder approval  and receive of the income earned by the prc operating entities 
in return  rise king wfoe provides consulting services to the prc operating entities 
in addition  to ensure that the prc operating entities and the prc shareholders perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements  the prc shareholders have pledged all of their equity interests in the prc operating entities to rise king wfoe 
they have also entered into an option agreement with rise king wfoe which provides that at such time as when the current restrictions under prc law on foreign ownership of chinese companies engaging in the internet content  information services or advertising business in china are lifted  rise king wfoe may exercise its option to purchase the equity interests in the prc operating entities directly 
at the time the above contractual agreements were entered into  the sole registered shareholder of rise king bvi was mr 
yang li  who owned  common stock of rise king bvi  which constituted all of the issued and outstanding shares of rise king bvi 
mr 
yang li entered into slow walk agreements with each of the control group individuals 
pursuant to the slow walk agreements  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  the control group individuals had the option to purchase the  shares of rise king bvi  by mr 
handong cheng   by mr 
xuanfu liu and  by ms 
li sun  acting as a nominee for mr 
zhige zhang held by mr

under the terms of the slow walk agreement  the control group will had the right to purchase the shares as follows one third of the shares when china net bvi and its prc subsidiaries and affiliates the group will generate at least rmb  of the gross revenue for twelve months commencing on january  and ending on december  the performance period i  one third of the shares when the group will generate at least rmb  of the gross revenue for six months commencing on january  and ending on june  the performance period ii  one third of the shares when the group generates at least rmb  of the gross revenue for six months commencing on july  and ending on december  the performance period iii

the control group also agreed and confirmed that he or she would act in concert with one another when exercising the rights authorized to them in this agreement 
the entrustment period commenced on the execution date of the agreement and was effective for a period of ten years  until its termination  as discussed below 
as described above  each of mssrs 
handong cheng  and xuanfu liu and ms

pursuant to the above contractual agreements  all of the equity owners rights and obligations of the vies were assigned to rise king wfoe  which resulted in the equity owners lacking the ability to make decisions that have a significant effect on the vies  and rise king wfoe s ability to extract the profits from the operation of the vies  and assume the residual benefits of the vies 
because rise king wfoe and its indirect parent are the sole interest holders of the vies  we included the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of the vies in our consolidated financial statements  which is consistent with the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation subtopic as a result of the share exchange on june   the former china net bvi shareholders owned a majority of our common stock 
the transaction was regarded as a reverse acquisition whereby china net bvi was considered to be the accounting acquirer as its shareholders retained control of our company after the share exchange  although we are the legal parent company 
the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of our company 
as such  china net bvi and its historical financial statements is the continuing entity for financial reporting purposes 
following the share exchange  we changed our name from emazing interactive  inc to chinanet online holdings  inc 
the financial statements have been prepared as if china net bvi had always been the reporting company and then on the share exchange date  had changed its name and reorganized its capital stock

basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and management estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america usgaap and include the accounts of our company  and all of our subsidiaries and vies 
we prepare financial statements in conformity with usgaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the financial reporting period 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information  our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
foreign currency translation our functional currency is united states dollars us  and the functional currency of china net hk is hong kong dollars hk 
the functional currency of our prc operating subsidiary and vies is renminbi rmb  and prc is the primary economic environment in which we operate 
for financial reporting purposes  the financial statements of our prc operating subsidiary and vies  which are prepared using the rmb  are translated into our reporting currency  the united states dollar us dollar 
assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at each balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during each reporting period  and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
adjustments resulting from the translation are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
the resulting exchange differences are included in the determination of net income of the consolidated financial statements for the respective periods 
the exchange rates used to translate amounts in rmb into us for the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements are as follows as of december  balance sheet items  except for equity accounts for the year ended december  items in the statements of income and comprehensive income  and statements cash flows no representation is made that the rmb amounts could have been  or could be converted into us at the above rates 
investment in equity investment affiliates investee companies that are not consolidated  but over which we exercise significant influence  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with asc topic equity method and joint ventures 
whether or not we exercise significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of several factors including  among others  representation on the investee companies board of directors and ownership level  which is generally a to interest in the voting securities of the investee companies 
under the equity method of accounting  an investee company s accounts are not reflected within our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income and comprehensive income  however  our share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is reflected in the caption share of earnings losses in equity investment affiliates in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
our carrying value including advance to the investees in equity method investee companies is reflected in the caption investment in and advance to equity investment affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets 
when our carrying value in an equity method investee company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated financial statements unless we guaranteed obligations of the investee company or have committed additional funding 
when the investee company subsequently reports income  we will not record its share of such income until it equals the amount of its share of losses not previously recognized 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as a result of acquisitions of interests in our subsidiaries 
goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least on an annual basis  and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the test consists of two steps 
first  identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
second  if there is impairment identified in the first step  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with topic  business combinations 
application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
the judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
deconsolidation we accounted for deconsolidation of subsidiaries in accordance with asc topic consolidation 
in accordance with asc topic  the parent shall account for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary by recognizing a gain or loss in net income attributable to the parent  measured as the difference between a 
the aggregate of all of the following the fair value of any consideration received  the fair value of any retained noncontrolling investment in the former subsidiary at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated  the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest in the former subsidiary including any accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the noncontrolling interest at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
b 
the carrying amount of the former subsidiary s assets and liabilities 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary we accounted for changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary in accordance with asc topic consolidation  subtopic  which requires the transaction be accounted for as equity transactions investments by owners and distributions to owners acting in their capacity as owners 
therefore  no gain or loss shall be recognized in consolidated net income or comprehensive income 
the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest shall be adjusted to reflect the change in its ownership interest in the subsidiary 
any difference between the fair value of the consideration received or paid and the amount by which the noncontrolling interest is adjusted shall be recognized in equity attributable to the parent and reallocated the subsidiary s accumulated comprehensive income  if any  among the parent and the noncontrolling interest through an adjustment to the parent s equity 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with asc topic in accordance with asc topic  revenues are recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the service has been rendered  iii the fees are fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
sales include revenues from reselling of advertising time purchased from tv stations  internet advertising and providing related value added technical services  reselling of internet advertising spaces and other advertisement related resources 
no revenue from advertising for advertising barter transactions was recognized because the transactions did not meet the criteria for recognition in asc topic  subtopic advertising contracts establish the fixed price and advertising services to be provided 
pursuant to advertising contracts  we provide advertisement placements in different formats  including but not limited to banners  links  logos  buttons  rich media and content integration 
revenue is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is provided and  as such  we consider the services to have been delivered 
we treat all elements of advertising contracts as a single unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
value added technical services are provided based on two types of contracts i fixed price and ii fixed price with minimum performance threshold 
for contracts with fixed price term  revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the engaged service period 
for fixed price contracts with minimum performance threshold  revenue is recognized when the specified performance criteria is met 
based upon our credit assessments of our customers prior to entering into contracts  we determine if collectability is reasonably assured 
in situations where collectability is not deemed to be reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash from customers  only after services have been provided and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
taxation income tax we adopt asc topic income taxes and use liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 
we adopt asc topic through and  which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and income tax disclosures 
for the year ended december  and  we did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions and did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions

internet advertising revenues for the year ended december  were approximately us million as compared to us million for the same period in  representing an increase of 
the increase in internet advertising revenue was primarily due to a slight increase in the overall average spending of our internet advertising customers in as compared to although our clients reduced their total advertising spending  most of them retained their basic advertising service and reduced their subscription on value added technical services in response to the economic downturn in the prc that began in the second half of in the meantime  we gradually gained some new clients as a result of the efforts we made in some new cities through our newly formed operating entities 
however  their contribution to our revenue was limited in we also have gradually gained new clients on liansuo 
com and presently there are approximately  clients listed on the site on a free trial period 
while clients were using liansuo 
com for free  it further expanded our exposure to larger clients  providing a new array of income source 
revenues generated from technical services offered by rise king wfoe were us million for the year ended december   as compared to us million for the same period in due to the chinese government s monetary policy of increasing interest rates and tightening the money supply  and other economic difficulties that unexpectedly began in the second quarter of  many of our clients  including our branded clients  who are mostly smes  reduced their advertising spending significantly in response to the overall economic situation in china 
the decrease in our internet advertising related technical services revenue for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in the average revenue per client by approximately 
in addition  some of our clients terminated the subscription of these services in the second half of we had a decrease in tv advertising revenue to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period in we generated this us million of tv advertising revenue by selling approximately  minutes of advertising time that we purchased from different provincial tv stations as compared with approximately  minutes of advertising time that we sold in the same period of the decrease in revenue we generated from the tv advertisement segment for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in were a direct result of the decrease of approximately  total minutes of tv advertising time sold in the year of as compared to  minutes sold in increases in demand for tv advertising were relatively limited due to much higher cost as compared to other advertising channels  such as internet advertising and print advertising  which resulted in lower demand from our customers for this service 
beginning in the middle of the fiscal year  due to the increase in the cost per minute charged by the tv stations  which cost was passed on to our end customers  our clients demand for the tv advertising service decreased significantly 
we had to decrease our selling price in order to sell all of the tv minutes purchased from the tv stations  which led to a low gross profit margin of approximately for this segment for the year ended december  in response to this decreased demand  for the year ended december   we reduced the business scope of the tv division  which was integrated into our overall advertising and marketing platform and provided to the existing internet client base as one of the additional communication channels 
we only kept a limited quantity of tv time slots with a relatively lower cost per minute  which led to more affordable prices for our customers and to a better match for our customers needs and cost budgets 
accordingly  along with the gradual increase in our selling price during as compared to  the gross profit margin of this segment improved significantly for the year ended december  to approximately as compared with for the prior year 
we will continue to monitor the demand from our customers for this segment  and purchase additional tv advertisement time  if necessary 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately us million of revenue from the bank kiosk business segment as compared to approximately us million for the same period in the bank kiosk advertising business is still in the very early stages of development and many details still need to be further analyzed and finalized before we allocate more capital to this business unit 
it was not a significant contributor to revenue for either the year ended december  or management currently believes that this business is unlikely to expand and some of the technology used in this business unit will be fully integrated into the overall advertising and marketing platform 
as a result of the acquisition of quanzhou zhi yuan  quanzhou tian xi shun he and the launch of zhao shang ke hubei  we operated our business in one more reportable business segment  brand management and sales channel building segment 
for the year ended december   we provided this service to approximately customers and achieved approximately us million of revenue from this segment 
upon deconsolidation of zhao shang ke hubei in december  only quanzhou zhi yuan and quanzhou tian xi shun he s revenue will be included in this segment in the future periods 
cost of revenues beginning on january   we combined the internet advertisement resources reselling segment and the internet information management segment with the internet advertisement segment  due to the fact that the relative percentage of these two combined segments financial performances were immaterial and will continue to be immaterial to our consolidated financial results going forward 
certain prior period amounts have been re grouped to conform to the current period presentation 
as a result of the acquisition of quanzhou zhi yuan  quanzhou tianxi shun he and the launch of zhao shang ke hubei  we operate in an additional reportable business segment  brand management and sales channel building 
our cost of revenue consisted of costs directly related to the offering of our advertising services  technical services  marketing services and brand management and sales channel building services 
the following table sets forth our cost of revenues  divided into five segments  by amount and gross profit ratio for the periods indicated  with inter segment transactions eliminated year ended december  amounts expressed in thousands of us dollars  except percentages revenue cost gp ratio revenue cost gp ratio internet advertisement technical service tv advertisement bank kiosk brand management and sales channel building others n a total cost of revenues our total cost of revenues decreased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period in this was mainly due to the decrease in costs associated with our tv advertisement business segment  which was in line with the decrease in our tv advertisement revenue 
our cost of revenues related to the offering of our advertising and marketing services primarily consists of internet resources purchased from other portal websites and technical services providers related to lead generation  sponsored search  tv advertisement time costs purchased from tv stations  direct labor cost associated with providing services and business taxes and surcharges 
cost associated with obtaining internet resources was the largest component of our cost of revenue for internet advertisement  accounting for approximately of our total internet advertisement cost of sales 
we purchased these internet resources from other well known portal websites in china  such as baidu  google and tecent qq 
our purchasing of these internet resources in large volumes for ultimate use by our customers allowed us to negotiate discounts with our suppliers 
the majority of the resources purchased were used by the internet advertising unit to attract more internet traffic to our advertising portals  assist our internet advertisement clients to obtain more diversified exposure and to generate more visits to their advertisements and mini sites placed on our portal websites 
for the years ended and  our total cost of sales for internet advertising was us million and us million  respectively 
the decrease in our cost of sales for internet advertising revenue was mainly due to a decreased volume of internet resources that we purchased to match the decreasing demands  and such decreases were partially offset by the increase in the purchase price of such resources as compared in beginning in december  our wfoe began providing a number of value added technical services to our internet advertisement customers 
the direct cost of sales for the wfoe s technical services revenue recognized by our wfoe was primarily the prc business tax expenses  which was approximately of the total technical service revenue recognized by rise king wfoe 
the decrease in the business tax expenses incurred by our wfoe in was in line with the decrease in the technical services revenue earned by our wfoe in as compared to that in tv advertisement time cost is the largest component of cost of revenue for tv advertisement revenue 
we purchase tv advertisement time from different provincial tv stations and resell it to our tv advertisement clients 
our tv advertisement time cost was approximately us million and us million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant decrease in our total tv advertisement time cost in year was mainly due to the decrease of the approximately  total minutes we purchased and resold in year as compared to year however  our gross profit margin for this segment increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period of this improvement was primarily due to the efficiency of purchasing tv time on a more cost effective basis while simultaneously matching our customers needs 
in addition  we only kept the tv advertising time from the stations that can be purchased on a more affordable cost basis as compared with the selling price that our customers can afford 
cost recognized for brand management and sales channel building business segment mainly consisted of director labor cost for providing these services to our customers and the related business tax and surcharges 
gross profit as a result of the foregoing  our gross profit was us million for the year ended december  as compared to us million for the same period in along with the improvement of the gross profit margin of our tv advertisement segment and the gross profit generated from our newly established business segment  brand management and sales channel building  our overall gross margin increased to for the year ended december  as compared with for the same period in operating expenses and net income our operating expenses consist of selling expenses  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses

for the year ended december   the change in our selling expenses was mainly due to the following reasons the increase in the share based compensation expenses in relation to the restricted stock and common stock purchase options issued to members of our sales department of approximately us million  the increase in staff salary  bonus  benefit expenses and other general selling expenses  such as entertainment expenses  travelling expenses and communication expenses of approximately us million  due to expansion of our sales department through newly formed and acquired vies in  and our brand development advertising expenses for our advertising web portals decreased by approximately us million 
we do not believe that brand building expenses will continue to be a significant portion of our selling expenses on a going forward basis  because  through the investment we made in brand building over the last three years  we have achieved our expected results 
our key advertising web portal  com has brand recognition as one of the most popular chinese internet portals providing advertising and marketing services and other value added services to smes  particularly for small and medium sized franchisors  in the prc 
beginning in fiscal year  management decided to gradually reduce such costs due to the significant increase in the costs of tv advertising 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to us million for the year ended december  as compared to us million for the same period in our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and benefits for management  accounting and administrative personnel  office rentals  depreciation of office equipment  professional service fees  maintenance  utilities and other office expenses

in the next three to five years  we expect our research and development expenses to be within the range of four percent to six percent of our total revenues 
operating profit as a result of the foregoing  our operating profit decreased to us million for the year ended december  from us million for the same period of changes in fair value of warrants we originally accounted for our warrants issued to investors and placement agent in our august financing as derivative liabilities under asc topic derivatives and hedging  because it contains a down round protection that were applicable if we were to issue new shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants 
the down round protection provision is not considered to be an input to the fair value of a fixed for fixed option on equity shares which lead to the warrants to fail to be qualified as indexed to the company s own stock and then fail to meet the scope exceptions of asc topic therefore  we accounted for the warrants as derivative liabilities under asc topic pursuant to asc topic  derivative should be measured at fair value and re measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings at each reporting period 
on march   we and the holders of the warrants entered into agreements to amend certain provisions of the warrants 
the amendment to the investor and placement agent warrants removes the down round protection rights 
in addition  the amendment to the warrants added a provision to grant the holders of a majority of the warrants an approval right until december   over any new issuance of shares of common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share less than the exercise price of the warrants 
as a result of this amendment  the warrants issued in the august financing were qualified as indexed to our own stock and then met the scope exceptions of asc topic  and were eligible to be reclassified as equity 
in accordance with asc topic  the classification of a contract should be reassessed at each balance sheet date 
if the classification required under this asc changes as a result of events during the period  the contract should be reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification 
if a contract is reclassified from an asset or a liability to equity  gains or losses recorded to account for the contract at fair value during the period that the contract was classified as an asset or a liability should not be reversed 
therefore  we re measured the fair value of the warrants as of march   the date of the event that caused the classification  which was approximately us million and reclassified the amount to equity as additional paid in capital 
the gain of the changes in fair value during the period that the warrants were classified as a derivative liability for the year ended december   which was approximately us million was recorded in earnings for the year ended december changes in fair value of contingent consideration receivables according to the acquisition agreements we entered into with quanzhou zhi yuan and quanzhou tian xi shun he  if audited pretax profit for and increases by less than compared to that of the prior year  the sellers shall compensate us for the difference between the target pretax profit and actual results achieved in cash 
fair value of the contingent consideration receivable as of the respective acquisition date of quanzhou zhi yuan and quanzhou tian xi shun he was approximately us million and us million  respectively 
as quanzhou zhi yuan and quanzhou tian xi shun he have both achieved their respective target pre tax profit for the year ended december   they will not compensate us any cash in accordance with the acquisition agreement 
we reassessed the fair value of these contingent consideration receivables as of december  for the respective make good arrangement of these acquirees for the year ended december   based on their respective historical performance and other relevant assumptions

restricted net assets as most of our operations are conducted through our prc subsidiary and vies  our ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on receiving distributions of funds from our prc subsidiary and vies 
relevant prc statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by our prc subsidiary and vies only out of their retained earnings  if any  as determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations and after it has met the prc requirements for appropriation to statutory reserves

the new prc enterprise income tax eit law  which was effected on january   also imposed a withholding income tax for dividends distributed by a foreign invested enterprise to its immediate holding company outside china  which were exempted under the previous eit law 
a lower withholding tax rate will be applied if there is a tax treaty arrangement between mainland china and the jurisdiction of the foreign holding company 
holding companies in hong kong  for example  will be subject to a rate 
rise king wfoe is invested by its immediate holding company in hong kong and will be entitled to the preferential withholding tax rate upon distribution of the dividends to its immediate holding company 
the ability of our prc subsidiaries to make dividends and other payments to us may also be restricted by changes in applicable foreign exchange and other laws and regulations 
foreign currency exchange regulation in china is primarily governed by the following rules foreign exchange administration rules  as amended in august  or the exchange rules  administration rules of the settlement  sale and payment of foreign exchange  or the administration rules 
currently  under the administration rules  renminbi is freely convertible for current account items  including the distribution of dividends  interest payments  trade and service related foreign exchange transactions  but not for capital account items  such as direct investments  loans  repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of china  unless the prior approval of the state administration of foreign exchange the safe is obtained and prior registration with the safe is made 
foreign invested enterprises like rise king wfoe that need foreign exchange for the distribution of profits to its shareholders may effect payment from their foreign exchange accounts or purchase and pay foreign exchange rates at the designated foreign exchange banks to their foreign shareholders by producing board resolutions for such profit distribution 
based on their needs  foreign invested enterprises are permitted to open foreign exchange settlement accounts for current account receipts and payments of foreign exchange along with specialized accounts for capital account receipts and payments of foreign exchange at certain designated foreign exchange banks 
although the current exchange rules allow the convertibility of chinese renminbi into foreign currency for current account items  conversion of chinese renminbi into foreign exchange for capital items  such as foreign direct investment  loans or securities  requires the approval of safe  which is under the authority of the people s bank of china 
these approvals  however  do not guarantee the availability of foreign currency conversion 
we cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain all required conversion approvals for our operations or the chinese regulatory authorities will not impose greater restrictions on the convertibility of chinese renminbi in the future 
currently  most of our retained earnings are generated in renminbi 
any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use retained earnings generated in renminbi to make dividends or other payments in us dollars or fund possible business activities outside china
