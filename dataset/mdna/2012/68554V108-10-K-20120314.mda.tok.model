the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview we operate primarily in the in vitro diagnostic business 
our business principally involves the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary oral fluid technologies  as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types 
we also manufacture and sell medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic products include tests that are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care and tests that are processed in a laboratory 
these products are sold in the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospitals  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
one of our products has been sold in the otc or consumer retail market in north america  europe  central and south america  and australia 
in vitro diagnostic testing is the process of analyzing oral fluid  blood  urine and other bodily fluids or tissue for the presence of specific substances or markers 
we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests 
when combined with their ease of use  non invasive nature  and cost effectiveness  our oral fluid tests represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
on august   we completed the acquisition of our subsidiary  dnag 
dnag is based in ottawa  canada and manufactures and sells kits that are used to collect samples of genetic material for molecular testing in the academic research  clinical genetic testing  pharmacogenomics  personalized medicine  animal and livestock genetics markets 
dnag s lead product line  which is sold under the oragene tradename  provides an all in one system for the collection  stabilization  transportation and storage of dna from human saliva 
dnag serves customers in multiple countries worldwide  including many leading research universities and hospitals in the world 
we rely heavily on distributors to purchase and resell many of our products 
for example  genomma labs genomma has exclusive rights to our wart removal product in the otc market in mexico  argentina  brazil and various other central and south american countries and reckitt benckiser formerly ssl international plc has similar rights to our wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
we have contracted with several distributors to sell our oraquick advance hiv test to the us physician office market and our intercept and orasure product lines are sold by several laboratory distributors 
we use distributors to sell our histofreezer product into the domestic and international physician office markets and we have engaged distributors to sell our oraquick rapid hiv and hcv tests in international markets 
we expect to enter into additional distribution agreements for existing and future products in the us 
table of contents and internationally 
if our distributors are unable or unwilling to meet the minimum purchase commitments set forth in their agreements or otherwise substantially reduce the volume of their purchases  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials and on related products supplied by third parties 
this is particularly true for our oraquick advance hiv test  our oraquick hcv test  our orasure oral fluid collection device and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources or if related products become unavailable  the time required and expense incurred to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products and could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
our orasure quickflu test is manufactured and supplied by a sole source supplier and dnag also utilizes contract manufacturers to supply all of its products and certain components to these products 
any disruption in the ability of these parties to manufacture and supply finished goods or product components for us or dnag could adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
competitive and economic outlook competition in the us market for hiv testing is intense and is expected to increase 
we believe that our principal competition will come from existing and new point of care rapid blood tests  automated laboratory based blood tests  or other oral fluid based tests that may be developed 
our competitors include medical diagnostic companies and specialized biotechnology firms  as well as pharmaceutical companies with biotechnology divisions 
competing rapid blood tests are often sold at a lower price than we charge for our oraquick hiv test 
this competition can result in lost sales and degradation of the price and therefore the profit margin we can charge for our product 
during  our oraquick hcv test was sold primarily to customers operating clia certified laboratories and competed against other laboratory based hcv blood tests 
however  in november  we received a clia waiver for this product  which enables us to sell our hcv product to many other customers that perform clia waived tests  such as outreach clinics  community based organizations and physician offices 
the clia waiver allows us to deploy the test more broadly in both the public health and hospital markets and  with the assistance of our collaborator  merck co  inc  merck  into the physician office market 
we believe the fda approval in of two new therapeutic treatments for hcv  both of which are more effective than previously available treatments  will help drive awareness and testing for hcv  including with our oraquick hcv rapid test 
while clia waiver opens the opportunity for significant sales growth in  demand for our hcv product will ultimately depend on the availability of government funds allocated to hcv testing efforts 
in addition  sales growth will depend on the success of merck s detailing efforts into the physician offices under our hcv collaboration arrangement 
in europe and other non us countries  our rapid hiv and hcv tests compete against other rapid and laboratory based tests 
significant sales of these products in europe have not materialized principally because of differences in european healthcare systems compared to our us systems 
unlike the us  adoption of rapid point of care diagnostics is not widespread in europe because laboratory testing is entrenched and healthcare systems are structured around centralized testing models 
in addition  many competing tests in international markets are sold at very low prices 
we intend to continue working to build awareness and develop strategies to expand sales of our oraquick hiv and hcv tests in european and other international markets 
in the substance abuse testing market  we expect competition for our products to intensify 
other companies have developed  and will continue to develop  competing oral fluid drug testing products 
in particular  there are at least two competitors that sell high throughput fully automated oral fluid drug testing products in unregulated settings in the united states 
in addition  one of these competitors has received k clearance of its product 
this k cleared product is being offered by one of our large laboratory distributors and we expect this 
table of contents distributor to stop selling our intercept product during these new products will compete against both our current intercept products and the high throughput assays we intend to commercialize jointly with roche diagnostics 
dnag s primary product  the oragene collection system  competes against other types of collection devices used for molecular testing  such as blood collection devices and buccal swabs  that often are sold for prices lower than the prices charged for the oragene products 
although we believe the oragene device offers a number of advantages over these other products  the availability of lower price competitive devices can result in lost sales and degradation in pricing and profit margin 
finally  current economic conditions  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue for the foreseeable future and intensify 
these conditions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers 
these circumstances could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct future acquisitions or make other discretionary investments 
many of our customers rely on public funding provided by federal  state and local governments  and this funding has been and may continue to be reduced or deferred as a result of current economic conditions 
these circumstances may adversely impact our customers and suppliers  which  in turn  could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment  raw materials or components 
in addition  demand for our products may also be adversely affected by current economic conditions 
current consolidated financial results during the year ended december   our total consolidated revenues were million including million from the operations of dnag  which represents a increase from excluding revenues of dnag  product revenues during the year ended december  increased when compared to licensing and product development revenues decreased in primarily as a result of the absence of million in milestone payments received under the terms of our collaboration agreement with merck during the year ended december  for the development and promotion of our oraquick rapid hcv test in europe 
our consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our loss for the current period included million of clinical trial spending related to the our oraquick hiv otc product  million of transaction costs incurred in connection with the dnag acquisition and million of non cash charges associated with the amortization of intangible assets and certain purchase accounting adjustments related to the dnag acquisition 
cash flow used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to the million provided by operating activities for the year ended december  as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  during  we used million of our cash to fund the dnag acquisition and related transaction expenses 
developments oraquick hcv test during  we continued our efforts to obtain fda approval of additional applications for our oraquick hcv test 
in february  we received fda approval for use of this device with fingerstick whole blood samples 
this product is now approved for use in the us with both venous whole blood and fingerstick whole blood 
although we currently intend to pursue approval of an oral fluid claim for our oraquick hcv test  the filing of a pma supplement for oral fluid has been delayed pending the completion of further discussions with the fda 

table of contents in march  we submitted to the fda an application for a clia waiver for our oraquick hcv test for use with venous and fingerstick whole blood 
this waiver was granted by the fda in november with the receipt of the clia waiver  we have begun several sales and marketing initiatives  which include the detailing by merck of the product into the u 
s physician office market under the terms of our hcv collaboration agreement 
additionally  we are finalizing and implementing distribution agreements with several large distributors to sell into physicians offices and federally funded community health centers 
we are also continuing to sell the product to hospitals while expanding our direct sales efforts to public health departments that currently have the infrastructure in place to conduct rapid hiv testing 
oraquick hiv otc test in the third quarter of  we completed the final phase of clinical testing for an oraquick hiv otc test 
in this study  individuals conducted unsupervised self testing using the investigational otc version of our oraquick advance hiv test with an oral fluid collection 
one of the study objectives specified by the fda was to identify at least hiv infected  but undiagnosed individuals 
in total  we enrolled and tested over  subjects using clinical sites across the us and identified more than previously undiagnosed hiv infected individuals 
our fda submission for this product was made in three separate parts or modules 
the first module was filed in august and contained data from all studies performed prior to the final phase 
the second module contained information about our manufacturing and customer care call center and was filed near the end of november 
the final module contained the results of the unobserved clinical trial and was filed in late december during  we continued planning for the commercial launch of our hiv otc test 
we completed an intensive interview process and selected an advertising agency  a sales  distribution and logistics provider  and a public relations firm to help market our test 
we also selected a third party to operate our customer care call center following commercial launch of this product 
in addition  we initiated a new round of market research to refresh our messaging and product positioning and to sharpen our demand forecast 
we expect this research to be completed during the first half of according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc  there are approximately million people in the us that are infected with hiv and approximately  of them are unaware of their status  despite current hiv testing options 
not only is their own health at risk  they are also unknowingly responsible for up to of the approximately  new hiv infections occurring each year in the us the cdc recommends routine hiv screening for all people ages to  with more frequent testing for people at higher risk 
we believe these cdc figures demonstrate that current hiv testing in the us is inadequate and there is a market for additional options to capture undiagnosed individuals infected with hiv  such as our hiv otc test 
oraquick hiv shelf life during the second quarter of  the fda approved a dating extension for our oraquick advance hiv test from to months 
we also received approval from our notified body to extend dating to months in europe 
in addition to being important for the professional markets that we serve  this shelf life extension is critical for our hiv otc product 
assuming we receive fda approval  we believe an hiv otc product offering would need a minimum shelf life of months or more in order to be successful 
oragene dx k clearance in december  dnag received fda k clearance for its oragene dx collection device  making it the first and only saliva dna collection and stabilization device to receive k clearance 
this fda k 
table of contents clearance permits clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine customers to use the oragene dx product with fda approved molecular testing applications 
this fda clearance will provide flexibility to diagnostic customers who wish to offer their patients the non invasive  reliable and easy to use oragene dx saliva sample collection device as an alternative to invasive blood collection 
in addition  this fda k clearance of oragene dx will enable molecular diagnostic test manufacturers to streamline their own regulatory submissions and potentially broaden market accessibility for their genetic testing products 
substance abuse testing in the first quarter of  the fda issued k clearances for use of high throughput oral fluid assays for pcp  opiates  cocaine and methamphetamines with our intercept oral fluid collection device 
these were the first such clearances resulting from our collaboration with roche diagnostics 
in the second quarter of  the fda issued an additional k clearance for an amphetamines assay 
we expect to begin selling a panel of k cleared assays together with our intercept device during the first quarter of clinical work on an assay for marijuana thc is continuing  and is expected to be completed during the first half of results of operations year ended december  compared to december  business segments we operate our business within two reportable segments 
the first is our core orasure business  which consists of the development  manufacture and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices and the manufacture and sale of medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery 
the second segment is the business of our newly acquired subsidiary  dnag  which is based in ottawa  canada and manufactures and sells oral fluid collection devices that are used to collect samples of genetic material for molecular testing 
orasure revenues consist primarily of product sold into the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospital  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
orasure also derives revenues from licensing and production development activities 
dnag revenues consist of product sold into the medicine  animal and livestock genetics markets 
consolidated revenues twelve months ended december   dollars change percentage of total revenues in thousands orasure dnag product revenues licensing and product development total revenues consolidated revenues increased to million including million attributable to operations of dnag in from million in excluding revenue attributable to dnag  our product revenues increased during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  increased sales of our infectious disease testing  substance abuse testing and cryosurgical systems products were 
table of contents partially offset by lower sales of our insurance risk assessment products 
the higher product revenues were partially offset by a million reduction in licensing and product development revenues during as compared to revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
because the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars  the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies was not material to our operating results 
however  the revenues and operating results of our newly acquired subsidiary  dnag  are recorded in canadian dollars and certain of its international sales are denominated in local currencies  including the euro  british pound and australian dollar 
our expectation is that the dnag business will continue to grow and  accordingly  we may experience increased foreign currency exposure in the future 
revenues by segment orasure segment the table below shows the amount of orasure s total revenues in thousands generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
twelve months ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues infectious disease testing market sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to million in oraquick sales totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands during and twelve months ended december  market change domestic hiv international hiv domestic hcv international hcv total oraquick revenues domestic oraquick hiv sales remained relatively flat at million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  international sales of our oraquick hiv test increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was largely the result of an improved funding environment as certain private and government customers were able to fund purchases 
however  due to the unpredictable nature of the international funding environment  we are unable to predict whether this improved level of sales will continue 

table of contents oraquick revenues for included million of sales of our oraquick hcv test  compared to  in as mentioned previously  we received a clia waiver for this product in november  enabling us to sell our hcv product to many other non clia certified customers  such as outreach clinics  community based organizations and physician offices 
while we believe the clia waiver provides an opportunity for significant sales growth  demand for our hcv product could be tempered by the unavailability of government funding allocated to hcv testing efforts 
in addition  sales growth will depend on the success of merck s detailing efforts into physician offices 
sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device decreased from million in to million in some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are now electing to purchase our oraquick advance test 
we believe this is the result of customers recognizing the benefits of rapid hiv testing  especially with oral fluid  as such  we expect that sales of our orasure device will continue to decline in the future 
during the year ended december   we sold  of our orasure quickflu product  which we began selling in the first quarter of sales of this product came in lower than expected primarily because the us experienced a weak flu season in substance abuse testing market sales to the substance abuse testing market increased from million in to million in  as a result of higher domestic sales of our intercept drug testing system 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands generated in each market during and twelve months ended december  market change domestic international total intercept revenues domestic intercept revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was largely the result of increased interest in oral fluid testing as well as growth achieved in the workplace market as hiring conditions have slowly begun to improve when compared to pursuant to a development agreement with roche diagnostics  homogenous fully automated oral fluid drugs of abuse assays have been developed for use with our intercept collection device 
the fda issued k clearances of high throughput assays for pcp  opiates  cocaine  methamphetamines  and amphetamines during the assays use roche s technology and will run on various automated analyzers to allow oral fluid samples to be processed with the same efficiency currently achieved with urine based drug tests 
we have also entered into a commercialization agreement with roche pursuant to which a drug testing system comprised of our intercept device and the newly developed homogenous assays will be marketed and sold on a worldwide basis 
at least two competitors have developed oral fluid tests suitable for use on fully automated homogeneous assay systems 
one of these products has received k clearance and is being offered by our largest laboratory distributor and we expect this distributor to stop selling our intercept product in sales of intercept to this distributor amounted to million in these new products will compete against both our intercept products and the high throughput assays we intend to commercialize jointly with roche diagnostics 
the loss of intercept sales to this significant distributor is expected to offset any expected increase in our workplace testing business due to continued economic improvement 

table of contents cryosurgical systems market sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets remained flat at million for the years ended december  and the table below shows a breakdown of our total cryosurgical revenues in thousands generated in each market during and twelve months ended december  market change professional domestic professional international over the counter total cryosurgical systems revenues sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states increased to million in  compared to million in  as a result of higher market penetration resulting from the continued efforts of our manufacturers sales representatives  improved focus by our distributors and an increase in sales to governmental entities 
in early  we signed agreements with two manufacturers sales representative organizations to support sales of our histofreezer product in the us under these agreements  over additional sales representatives have been working with our physicians office distributors throughout the unites states 
sales of histofreezer in the international market remained flat at million in and during the year ended december   our otc cryosurgical sales decreased primarily due to a decline in sales to our latin american distributor  genomma 
during  genomma had purchases totaling million compared to million in in late  the mexican government placed limitations on the advertising genomma could use for our product 
in addition  during the first quarter of  genomma informed us of some changes required by the brazilian government to our package insert  which have since been made 
both events negatively impacted sales of our product during we believe that both of these issues were resolved in sales to our european otc distributor reckitt benckiser remained flat at million in and our distributor contract with reckitt benckiser was subject to renewal at the end of we are currently in negotiations to extend this contract 
insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market decreased from million in to million in  as a result of variability in the timing of orders  general softness in the life insurance market  and the adoption by some underwriters of a simplified issues policy 
this is a policy where lab based testing is replaced by having applicants respond to a questionnaire about their behaviors 
two of our larger customers adopted this new policy in licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues decreased to million in from million in during we received million in milestone payments as a result of our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives pursuant to our collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of our oraquick rapid hcv test in europe 
we expect to receive an additional million milestone payment pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement in 
table of contents the remaining licensing revenues for these periods represent royalties received on domestic outsales of merck s otc cryosurgical wart removal product  pursuant to a license and settlement agreement executed in january in  the royalty rate decreased pursuant to the terms of our license 
royalties under this license will no longer be received after certain of our cryosurgical patents expire in august dnag segment molecular collection systems molecular collection systems revenues primarily represent sales of dnag s oragene product line in the molecular diagnostics and research markets 
the million in revenues reflect dnag sales from the august  acquisition date through december  during the fourth quarter of  dnag shipped million of product to its largest customer  which historically has made bulk purchases once a year 
consolidated operating loss consolidated operating loss increased million to million in  compared to million in the increased loss was primarily caused by higher research and development expenses due to increased clinical trial costs related to our oraquick hiv otc test and increased general and administrative expense resulting from the transaction costs associated with the dnag acquisition and increased amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in the dnag acquisition 
consolidated gross margin was for both and operating loss by segment orasure segment orasure s gross margin was in compared to in orasure s margin benefited from improved product mix  more efficient manufacturing operations  lower direct labor costs  improved absorption of overhead costs as a result of staffing optimization and a change to automated manufacturing during the margin benefited from the million in hcv milestone payments received during that period 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of a million increase in clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hiv otc test 
the higher clinical trial costs related to our oraquick hiv otc test were partially offset by lower clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hcv test 
we expect orasure s research and development costs will decrease in sales and marketing expenses declined to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower consulting expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase from levels as we prepare for the launch of our hiv otc product 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of million in transaction costs associated with the dnag acquisition 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain flat when compared to levels 
dnag segment dnag s gross margin for the period from august  through december  was and reflects the impact of a  non cash purchase accounting adjustment to mark up the acquired finished goods inventory to fair value 
dnag s gross margin also included approximately  of amortization expense related to the acquisition 
ongoing amortization expense related to the dnag acquisition will continue to impact gross margins in future periods 

table of contents dnag incurred million in operating expenses during this included million of research and development costs 
million of sales and marketing expenses and million of general and administrative expenses 
the dnag expenses also included a total of  of amortization expense related to the acquisition 
ongoing amortization expense related to the dnag acquisition will continue to impact operating expense levels in future periods 
consolidated income taxes in  we continued our evaluation of whether the full valuation allowance established in against orasure s total net deferred tax asset is still appropriate and concluded that the full valuation allowance remained appropriate as the facts and circumstances since the establishment of the allowance had not changed 
as a result  no us income tax benefit was recorded for orasure s pre tax loss in in connection with the dnag acquisition  a deferred income tax liability was recorded to reflect the tax effects of basis differences of intangible assets and inventories for financial reporting and canadian income tax purposes 
a canadian income tax benefit of  was also recorded in associated with the dnag loss before income taxes and certain canadian research and development and investment tax credits 
year ended december  compared to december  during the year ended december   we operated our business within one reportable segment  our core orasure business 
the results of these operations are described below 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in decreased sales in the infectious disease testing  substance abuse testing  and insurance risk assessment markets were partially offset by an increase in sales of our cryosurgical systems products and higher licensing and product development revenues 
revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of our international sales were denominated in us dollars

table of contents the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands during and twelve months ended december  market change domestic international total oraquick revenues during  sales of the oraquick advance hiv test in the us market decreased or million  when compared to this decrease in revenue reflects lower sales volumes resulting from changes in ordering patterns of one of our larger public health customers and reduced public health funding by state and local governments  as well as a lower average selling price 
international sales of our oraquick hiv test decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from customer losses due to price competition  changes in the use of our test within government testing algorithms  and a decrease or elimination of funding for hiv testing initiatives 
sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device decreased from million in the to million in due to reduced public health funding by state and local governments 
in addition  some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are now electing to purchase our oraquick advance test 
substance abuse testing market sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased in primarily as a result of lower sales of our intercept drug testing system and a decrease in laboratory equipment sales 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands generated in each market during and twelve months ended december  market change domestic international total intercept revenues domestic intercept revenues decreased and international revenues remained relatively flat for when compared to the prior year

table of contents sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states increased to million in  compared to million in  largely due to the elimination of the diversion of less expensive international histofreezer product into the domestic market 
in addition  in early  we signed agreements with two manufacturers sales representative organizations to support sales of our histofreezer product in the us under these arrangements  over additional sales representatives are working with our physicians office distributors throughout the united states  resulting in additional domestic histofreezer sales growth during this year 
sales of histofreezer in the international market decreased in  compared to this decline was largely due to a discontinuance of sales to certain foreign distributors that we believe were diverting product to the us market 
the selling prices for our histofreezer product are lower in some foreign countries due to differences in the healthcare systems in those countries 
during and early  some distributors in these countries purchased english labeled histofreezer product and resold it into the domestic distribution network to distributors who employ alternate sourcing programs 
we also experienced a decline in histofreezer sales in the european market as a result of the negative impact of changing european health regulations 
in the european professional marketplace  healthcare reimbursement has been reduced or eliminated for certain treatment types  including treatments for common warts 
during the year ended december   our otc cryosurgical sales decreased primarily due to decreased sales to our latin american otc distributor  genomma 
during  genomma increased its purchases to support the launch of our otc cryosurgical wart removal product in brazil 
we did not have this similar pipeline fill in  resulting in a decrease in sales to genomma of approximately  in july  ssl international ssl  our european otc distributor  was acquired by reckitt benckiser group plc 
sales to reckitt for distribution in the european otc market were million in and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we launched our own wart removal product under the freeze n clear skin clinic tm tradename into the us otc cryosurgical marketplace 
this venture resulted in limited revenues 
as a result of the product s limited success  competing priorities and limited corporate funding  management ended its participation in the us otc cryosurgical marketplace at the end of insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market decreased from million in to million in  as some insurance companies abandoned pre screening for lower face value insurance policies 
licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues increased to million during from million during this increase was primarily due to million in milestone payments received as a result of our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives pursuant to a collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of our oraquick rapid hcv test in international markets 
the remaining licensing revenues for both and represent royalties received on domestic outsales of merck s otc cryosurgical wart removal product  pursuant to our license and settlement agreement executed in january gross margin orasure s gross margin was in  compared to in the increase in gross margin in was primarily the result of the higher licensing and product development revenues 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  as a result of lower validation and clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hcv test 
these decreases were partially offset by higher laboratory supplies expense related to the development of new infectious disease products and higher clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hiv otc test 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower relocation expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged at million in and lower legal expenses in were offset by an increase in consulting costs 
in november  we settled the patent infringement lawsuit filed by inverness medical and church dwight 
pursuant to the settlement we paid inverness million 
we recorded million of the million payment as litigation settlement expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the remaining million was recorded as prepaid royalties and is being expensed in cost of goods sold in relation to estimated oraquick advance hiv revenues to be generated through december  during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to license payments for certain hcv patents  which we previously capitalized 
management s intent in capitalizing these payments was to utilize this license in certain developing countries for the marketing and sale of an existing rapid hcv test supplied by a third party manufacturer 
however  we were unable to penetrate this international marketplace with this third party s rapid hcv test 
furthermore  given the impact of the current global recession and the deteriorating status of certain third world economies  we no longer believed that we would be successful in selling this third party s rapid hcv test in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the remaining unamortized book value of the patent and product rights in the quarter ended june  income taxes in  we established a full valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
management has continued to evaluate whether the full valuation is still appropriate 
at december   we concluded that the full valuation allowance remained appropriate as the facts and circumstances since the establishment of the allowance had not changed 
as a result  no income tax benefit was recorded in in november  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted 
this new law extended the carryback period for a net operating loss nol from two years up to a maximum of five years 
the carryback of the nol can be applied to both regular tax nols and alternative minimum tax amt nols 
the new law also eliminates the limitation on the use of any amt nols 
as a result of the elimination of the limitations  we elected to carryback our amt nol to our   and tax years and apply for a refund of the amt taxes paid for those years 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  federal tax benefit associated with this amt nol carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a nominal amount of state income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital 
table of contents our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million from million at december  to million at december   largely due to the use of million in cash to fund the dnag acquisition and related transaction expenses 
our working capital likewise declined from million at december  to million at december  as a result of this significant use of cash 
during  we used million in cash to finance our operating activities 
our net loss of million was partially offset by non cash stock based compensation expense of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a non cash inventory purchase accounting adjustment of  and a deferred income tax benefit of  additional uses of cash in operating activities included a million increase in accounts receivable balances largely caused by end of the quarter customer shipments and a million increase in inventory largely due to stocking of our oraquick hiv and hcv tests 
offsetting these uses of cash were a  increase in accounts payable due to the build of inventory to fulfill fourth quarter orders  a  increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities due to year end accruals for marketing and accounting expenses and management incentive bonuses and a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets as a result of the amortization of outstanding balances 
we used a total of million in investing activities during in order to acquire dnag we used million of cash  net of dnag cash acquired 
we also purchased million of property and equipment offset by the maturity of million of certificates of deposit 
during the year ended december   we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily to purchase additional equipment  upgrade certain older equipment and make improvements to our facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  primarily as a result of million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by  in loan principal repayments and  used for the repurchase of common stock related to the vesting of restricted shares 
as of december   we had in place a  credit facility the credit facility with comerica bank comerica 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  principal and interest fixed at per annum are payable monthly through may   at which time the remaining unpaid principal balance is payable 
as of december   we had no available borrowings under this credit facility 
we are currently in negotiations with comerica to refinance this credit facility 
all borrowings from comerica are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of orasure s assets  including present and future accounts receivable  chattel paper  contracts and contract rights  equipment and accessories  general intangibles  investments  instruments  inventories  and a mortgage on our three facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
the comerica agreement contains certain covenants that set forth minimum requirements for our quick ratio  liquidity  and tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  the agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends  to make certain investments  to incur additional indebtedness  to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets  and to merge or consolidate operations with an unaffiliated entity  without the consent of comerica 
our current cash and cash equivalents is expected to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of future strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the cost of any future litigation  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of market launch of new products including our oraquick hiv otc test  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the impact of the ongoing economic downturn and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  clinical trial accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents business combinations 
we account for acquisitions or business combinations in accordance with accounting standards codification  business combinations 
pursuant to the acquisition method of accounting included in that guidance  we allocate the purchase price of a business combination to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is then recorded as goodwill 
in accounting for business combinations  we make valuation assumptions that require significant estimates  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these critical estimates are based on historical experience  information obtained from management of the acquired company or third party advisors  and expectations of future cash flows to be derived from customer contracts  customer lists  and acquired developed technologies or products  evaluated at various discount rates 
management estimates fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
as such  actual results may differ from these estimates 
estimates associated with the accounting for a business combination may also change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are recorded net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers except for warranty returns 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
we record shipping and handling charges billed to our customers as product revenue and the related expense as cost of products sold 
taxes assessed by governmental authorities  such as sales or value added taxes  are excluded from product revenues 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  as of december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
the current economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue indefinitely and intensify  and could adversely affect the operations  cash flows and financial condition of our customers 
these circumstances may adversely impact the liquidity or financial position of our customers and could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate quantities on hand and the carrying value of our inventories to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the estimated forecast of product sales 
when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off  as in the case of lapsing expiration dates 
during and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of  in  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of million 
these write offs were as a result of 
table of contents quality  scrap and product expiration issues 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the fair value of equity based awards as compensation expense in our statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model s computations incorporate highly subjective assumptions  such as the expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of the options  after considering the effect of expected forfeitures  is then amortized  generally on a straight line basis  over the related vesting period of the option 
the fair value of our restricted shares is based on the market value of the shares at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the related vesting period of the award 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
together  these assets had a net book value of million  or of our total assets  as of december  property and equipment and intangible assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of our assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all remaining long lived and intangible assets as of december  will exceed their book value 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended december  or any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price we paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of dnag 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if we believe that indicators of impairment exist 
performance of the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the test to determine the amount of the impairment loss 
the second step involves measuring the impairment by comparing the implied fair values of the affected reporting unit s goodwill and intangible assets with the respective carrying values 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of million 
the net deferred tax assets  before a full valuation allowance  associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset  in order to determine if a valuation allowance should be recorded against it pursuant to fasb accounting guidance 
we 
table of contents determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax asset in the immediate future 
accordingly  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
during the past three years  we continued to reevaluate our valuation allowance position and believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax asset will not be realized in the immediate future 
as such  we maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of december  and associated with the operations subject to income tax in the us our ability to use our nol carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal nol carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
during  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes had occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our future taxable income 
the company continues to review ownership changes on an annual basis and we have not had a subsequent ownership change that would impact the nols 
in connection with the dnag acquisition  a deferred tax liability was recorded to reflect the tax effects of basis differences of intangible assets and inventories for financial reporting and canadian income tax purposes 
for the year ended december  we recorded a canadian income tax benefit of  associated with dnag s loss before income taxes and certain canadian research and development and investment tax credits 
the income tax benefit associated with dnag was considered realizable based upon the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with the acquisition of dnag 
clinical trial accruals 
some of our research and development is conducted by third parties  including contract research and development service providers 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the end of each quarter  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated service provided  we record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we record a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 

table of contents in january  we elected to fix the interest rate on our long term debt at 
as a result  we have no exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in canada  europe and africa  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from foreign currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency were of our total revenues for the year ended december  including revenues from dnag 
we expect the dnag business will continue to grow and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may increase
