table of contents overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of engineered dna binding proteins for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for unmet medical needs 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on the engineering of novel zinc finger dna binding proteins zfps for the regulation and modification of genes 
our strategy is to develop highly specific zfp nucleases zfns and zfp transcription factors zfp tfs through early stage clinical testing and strategically partner with biopharmaceutical companies to execute late stage clinical trials and commercial development 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from corporate collaborations and research grants 
for the year ended december   we incurred a consolidated net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the same period in as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest receivable totaling million compared to million as of december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfns and zfp tfs  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner funding will continue beyond their initial terms 
in the development of our zfp technology platform  we are focusing our resources on higher value zfp therapeutic product development and less on our non therapeutic applications 
we are conducting a phase and two phase clinical trials to evaluate a zfp therapeutic for the treatment of hiv aids 
development of novel therapeutic products is costly and is subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process by the fda 
our future products will be gene based therapeutics 
adverse events in both our own clinical program and other programs may have a negative impact on regulatory approval  the willingness of potential commercial partners to enter into agreements and the perception of the public 
in january  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with shire ag shire  pursuant to which we will collaborate with shire to research  develop and commercialize human therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based on our zfp technology the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue is generally recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed 
table of contents and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for products or services delivered and the collectability of those fees 
since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future licensee s product sales 
revenue from research activities made under strategic partnering agreements and collaborations is recognized as the services are provided when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue generated from research and licensing agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  minimum sublicense fees  milestone payments and royalties on future licensee s product sales 
multiple element arrangements prior to the adoption of asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
for revenue arrangements entered into before january   that include multiple deliverables  the elements of such agreement were divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables met certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items could be determined and whether there was evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration was allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
prior to the adoption of asu  we recognized nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license were delivered and over the period of performance obligations if we had continuing performance obligations 
we estimated the performance period at the inception of the arrangement and reevaluated it each reporting period 
changes to these estimates were recorded on a prospective basis 
multiple element arrangements after the adoption of asu asu amended the accounting standards for certain multiple element revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate elements  require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration to each element based on a selling price hierarchy  also called the relative selling price method  where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using the selling price hierarchy 
since adoption of asu  we have not entered into new agreements and recognized revenues under this standard as of december  for future revenue agreements with multiple element arrangements  such as license and development agreements  we will allocate revenue to each non contingent element based on the relative selling price of each element 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price or tpe of selling price 
if neither exists we use esp for that deliverable 
revenue allocated is then recognized when the basic four revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
research and development expenses we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
research and development expenses consist of direct and research related allocated overhead costs such as facilities costs  salaries and related personnel costs  
table of contents and material and supply costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include costs related to clinical trials  validation of our testing processes and procedures and as well as related overhead expenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development that have no alternative future use are expensed as incurred 
expenses resulting from clinical trials are recorded when incurred based in part on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  employee stock purchases related to the employee share purchase plan espp and restricted stock units rsus  on estimated fair values 
the fair value of share based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using a straight line method over the requisite service period 
to estimate the value of a stock option award and purchases related to espp  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires inputs such as expected life  expected volatility and risk free interest rate 
these inputs are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
while estimates of expected life and volatility are derived primarily from our historical data  the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant commensurate with the expected life assumption 
to estimate the value of rsus  we use the closing market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued 
further  we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in determining the fair value of stock based awards  the stock based compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values revenues collaboration agreements research grants total revenues total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements and research grants 
we anticipate revenues over the next several years will primarily be derived from our collaboration agreements with shire  sigma aldrich corporation sigma and dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned subsidiary of dow chemical corporation 
revenues from our corporate collaboration agreements were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in from was primarily due to the completion in july of the amortization period of revenues related to the commercial license fee received from sigma under the 
table of contents expanded agreement of october the decrease in from was primarily due to decreased revenues of million in connection with our license agreement with das which was mainly due to a decrease in amortized revenues associated with the commercial option fee paid by das in june research grant revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase in relates to million of increased revenues from our agreement with the chdi foundation  inc chdi to develop a novel therapeutic for huntington s disease  increased revenues of million from the california institute for regenerative medicine cirm and increased revenues of million for other research grants  partially offset by decreased revenues of million related to funding from the juvenile diabetes research foundation international jdrf to support development of sb for the development of diabetic neuropathy dn due to completion of our phase b clinical trial sb additionally  we received million in funds awarded and recognized as revenue for four qualifying therapeutic discovery projects under the patient protection and affordable care act in the increase of million in from was primarily due to an increase of million from jdrf  million from cirm as well as million for four qualifying therapeutic discovery projects funded under the patient protection and affordable care act in operating expenses year ended december  change change change change in thousands  except percentage values operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expenses we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the future and expect research and development expenses to increase in the next several years if we are successful in advancing our hiv aids program in the clinic and if we are able to progress our earlier stage zfp therapeutic product candidates into clinical trials 
we also expect that expenses related to research performed under our collaboration and license agreement with shire will increase our research and development expenses during the term of the agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement with shire  future expenses related to research activities related to the collaboration will be reimbursed by shire  including employee and external research costs 
the reimbursement funds received from shire will be recognized as revenue as the costs are incurred and collection is assured 
research and development expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the decrease of million in from was primarily due to decreased clinical and manufacturing expenses related to our sb program  specifically our phase b study in diabetic neuropathy  offset partially by increased spending on our hiv aids program 
the increase of million in from was primarily due to increased clinical expenses related to diabetic neuropathy dn  specifically our phase b study 
in october  we announced that the sb trial did not meet its primary or secondary clinical endpoints in subjects with moderate severity dn as compared to placebo and we decided not to pursue additional clinical development of the sb program 
the main focus of our resources is on the development of zfp therapeutics  and we have a novel therapeutic for hiv aids in phase clinical trials 
we also have preclincal projects in hemophilia and parkinson s disease as well as monogenic rare diseases 
additionally  under the collaboration and license agreement with shire we 
table of contents are being funded by shire to carry out all research activities through the submission of an investigative new drug application or european clinical trial application for the development of seven gene targets for potential human therapeutic products 
the initial four gene targets are blood clotting factors vii  viii  ix and x  and products developed for such initial gene targets would be used for treating hemophilia 
shire has the right  subject to certain limitations  to designate three additional gene targets 
we also have two collaborations in non therapeutic applications of our technology 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with das  we provide manufacturing and research assistance for our zfp technology through in addition  to the extent we receive royalties pursuant to these collaborations  we will incur fees related to certain technologies that we have in licensed 
drug development is inherently uncertain and the successful completion of our development programs is subject to numerous technological challenges and risks and we cannot presently estimate anticipated completion dates for any of our programs 
material cash inflows associated with the sale of products  if any  which result from our research efforts are not expected for at least five years 
see risk factors our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process  and if these potential products are not approved  we will not be able to commercialize these products and our gene regulation and gene modification technology is relatively new  and if we are unable to use this technology in all our intended applications  it would limit our revenue opportunities 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development programs  sb t and sb  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects and activity associated with various research collaborations 
year ended december  in thousands programs sb t sb other research and development projects total research and development expenses general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  stock based compensation expenses  professional fees  allocated facilities expenses  patent prosecution expenses and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase of million in from was primarily due to increased professional services  including legal fees  and higher salaries and personnel related expenses due to higher headcount 
there were no significant changes in general and administrative expenses in from program terminated in october 
table of contents interest income  net interest income  net  was million in and  compared to million in the decrease in from was due to lower investment yields and lower average investment balances 
other income there was no other income in or other income for was million 
other income in was primarily comprised of net foreign currency remeasurement gains related to the cash balance held by our wholly owned uk subsidiary  gendaq limited 
the cash balance was transferred to our us investment account in the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources liquidity since inception  we have incurred significant annual net losses and we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators and strategic partners and research grants 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest receivable totaling million compared to million as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to the completion of an underwritten public offering of our common stock in april  in which  shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares in this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses  were approximately million 
this was partially offset by the use of capital required to fund our continuing operations  including the advancement of our zfp therapeutic programs 
our most significant use of capital pertains to salaries and benefits for our employees and external development expenses  such as manufacturing and clinical trial activity  related to our zfp therapeutic programs 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  us treasury debt securities  corporate debt securities and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy with a view toward capital preservation and liquidity 
in january   we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with shire ag shire  pursuant to which we will collaborate with shire to research  develop and commercialize certain gene targets in human therapeutics and diagnostics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based on our zfp technology 
under the agreement  we received an upfront license fee of million 
we are also eligible to receive milestone payments upon the achievement of specified research  regulatory  clinical development  commercialization and sales milestones 
the total amount of potential milestone payments for each gene target  assuming the achievement of all specified milestones  is million 
the milestone payments for each gene target through the acceptance of an ind or cta submission total million 
we will also receive royalty payments that are a tiered double digit percentage of net sales of products developed under the collaboration 
cash flow net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in for all periods  net cash used in operating activities primarily reflects our net operating losses 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily the result of decreased cash received related to our revenues in as well as increased operating expenses 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in compared to was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and deferred revenues under our million license agreement with sigma  which was received in full in october  but recognized through july 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million in cash flows from investing activities for all periods primarily related to purchases  sales and maturities of investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the completion of an underwritten public offering of the our common stock in april  in which  shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares in this offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses  were approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily related to proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities in were primarily attributable to the sale of our common stock 
in october  pursuant to the expanded license agreement with sigma  we issued  shares of common stock valued at per share to sigma  resulting in proceeds of million 
additionally  in october  we completed an underwritten public offering of common stock  in which we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we anticipate continuing to incur operating losses for at least the next several years 
while we expect our rate of cash usage to increase in the future  in particular to support our product development endeavors  we believe that the available cash resources as well as funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and research grants will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through future capital requirements will be substantial and if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations  including zfp therapeutic development activities  through equity or debt financing 
additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  or if the terms of potential funding sources are unfavorable  our business and our ability to develop our technology and our zfp therapeutic products would be harmed 
furthermore  any sales of additional equity securities may result in dilutions to our stockholders 
our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors  including the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of clinical trials for our product candidates and potential product candidates  the outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  the success of our collaboration agreement with shire  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of product candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  the timing and terms of future in licensing and out licensing transactions  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution capabilities  the cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  and the possible costs of litigation 
there is no provision for income taxes because we have only incurred losses since our inception 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of 
table of contents approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the net federal and state operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in we also have federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in while the state research credits have no expiration date 
utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation could result in the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryforwards before use 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations total contractual obligations operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees associated with cancelable in licensed patent agreements 
recent accounting pronouncement in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu updates revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple elements 
the revised guidance provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element arrangements guidance 
the first relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this change is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identifiable deliverables 
we may be required to exercise considerable judgment in determining the estimated selling price of delivered items under new agreements 
we adopted this guidance prospectively beginning january  there was no effect on the financial statements for fiscal year as we did not enter into or modify any such agreements as contemplated by the new standard 
however  we expect that this adoption could have a material impact on our financial statements going forward  including on the accounting for the collaboration agreement with shire 
in june  accounting standards codification topic  comprehensive income was amended to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
accordingly  a company can present all non owner changes in stockholders equity either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we plan to adopt this guidance as of january  on a retrospective basis and do not expect the adoption thereof to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk relates to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and capturing a market rate of return based on our investment policy parameters and market conditions 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash 
table of contents equivalents and investments in securities of high credit quality and with varying maturities to match projected cash needs 
as of december   none of our securities have maturities exceeding one year 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
our investments currently consist of us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities and corporate notes 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
