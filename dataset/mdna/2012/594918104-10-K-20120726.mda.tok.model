md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements 
overview and outlook microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential 
we create technology that transforms the way people work  play  and communicate across a wide range of computing devices 
we generate revenue by developing  licensing  and supporting a wide range of software products and services  including cloud based services  by designing and selling hardware  and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience 
our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees  designing  manufacturing  marketing  and selling our products and services  and income taxes 
industry trends our industry is dynamic and highly competitive  with frequent changes in both technologies and business models 
each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products  new technologies  or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business 
at microsoft  we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to anticipate the changing demands of customers  industry trends  and competitive forces 
key opportunities and investments based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long term research and development of new products and services  we see significant opportunities to drive future growth 
smart connected devices the price per unit of processing  storage  and networks continues to decline while at the same time devices increase in capability 
as a result  the capabilities and accessibility of pcs  tablets  phones  televisions  and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow 
at the same time  the information and services people use increasingly span multiple devices enabled by the adoption of cloud computing 
for example  the delivery and quality of unified entertainment experiences across devices is undergoing dramatic evolution 
these rich media experiences include books  magazines  newspapers  games  movies  music  television  and social interactions with family  friends  and colleagues 
at microsoft  our approach is to simplify and increase the accessibility of these entertainment experiences to broaden market penetration of our software  hardware  and services 
additionally  web content and social connections have increased tremendously as people spend more time online  while discoverability and accessibility has been transforming from direct navigation and document links 
there is significant opportunity to deliver products and services that help users make faster  better decisions and complete tasks more simply when using their devices 
our approach is to use machine learning to understand user intent  and differentiate our products and services by focusing on the integration of speech  visual  social  and other elements to simplify people s interaction with the internet 
we invest significant resources in enabling and developing smart connected devices that offer a unified  seamless experience across a common platform 
whether a pc  windows phone  xbox  or the newly announced surface 
table of contents part ii item devices  our goal is to provide users with a consistent and compelling experience through a common user interface and our services such as skydrive  xbox live  bing  skype  and our windows azure cloud platform 
communications and productivity the ubiquity of computing and software tools has transformed personal and business productivity 
over the last decade  microsoft redefined software productivity beyond the rich office client on the pc 
productivity scenarios now encompass unified communications such as instant messaging  voice  and video communications  business intelligence  collaboration  content management  and relationship management  all of which are increasingly available through server side applications 
these server applications can be hosted in the cloud by the customer  a partner  or by microsoft 
there are significant opportunities to bring to life productivity and communication scenarios across pcs  mobile  and other devices that connect to services 
we invest significant resources in our products and services that make this possible dynamics  exchange  lync  skype  office  office  sharepoint  windows live  and windows phone 
cloud computing transforming the data center and information technology cloud based solutions provide customers with software  services  and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers 
computing is undergoing a long term shift from client server to the cloud  a shift similar in importance and impact to the transition from mainframe to client server 
the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones  larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer  geographic  and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing  storage  and network resources  and multi tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds 
because of the improved economics  the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enables new solutions and applications 
for businesses of all sizes  the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non differentiating activities to reliable and cost effective providers 
we are devoting significant resources to developing cloud infrastructure  platforms  and applications including offerings such as microsoft dynamics online  microsoft sql azure  office  windows azure  windows intune  and windows server 
economic conditions  challenges  and risks as discussed above  our industry is dynamic and highly competitive 
we must anticipate changes in technology and business models 
our model for growth is based on our ability to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends  to enter new markets  both in terms of geographies and product areas  and to drive broad adoption of the products and services we develop and market 
at microsoft  we prioritize our investments among the highest long term growth opportunities 
these investments require significant resources and are multi year in nature 
the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally  brought to market as part of a partnership or alliance  or through acquisition 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide 
microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach  scale in resources  and competitive compensation 
demand for our software  services  and hardware has a strong correlation to global macroeconomic factors 
the current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic 
see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part ii  item a

they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities  diversified among industries and individual issuers 
the investments are predominantly us dollar denominated securities  but also include foreign currency denominated securities in order to diversify risk 
our fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed income indices 
the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities 
while we own certain mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the majority of our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a principal and interest guarantee  primarily from federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation  and government national mortgage association 
we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign borrowers and counterparties 
our gross exposures to our customers and investments in portugal  italy  ireland  greece  and spain are individually and collectively not material

securities lending we lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns 
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 
cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 
our securities lending payable balance was million as of june  our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were billion and billion  respectively 
intra year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 
valuation in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  such as exchange traded mutual funds  domestic and international equities  and us treasuries 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as corporate notes and bonds  foreign government 
table of contents part ii item bonds  mortgage backed securities  and agency securities 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments 
broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available  the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors  or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades 
our broker priced investments are generally labeled as level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments 
in addition  all of our broker priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
these controls include model validation  review of key model inputs  analysis of period over period fluctuations  and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 
cash flows fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash flows from operations increased billion during the current fiscal year to billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers 
cash used for financing increased billion to billion due mainly to a billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and a billion increase in dividends paid  offset in part by a billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases 
cash used in investing increased billion to billion due mainly to a billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities  partially offset by a billion decrease in cash used for net purchases  maturities  and sales of investments 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash flows from operations increased billion during the current fiscal year to billion due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers 
cash used in financing decreased billion to billion due mainly to a billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt  net of repayments  offset in part by a million increase in cash paid for dividends 
cash used in investing increased billion to billion due to a billion increase in purchases of investments  offset in part by a billion increase in cash from securities lending 
debt we issued debt in prior periods to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets  reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment 
the proceeds of these issuances were used to partially fund discretionary business acquisitions and share repurchases 
as of june   the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long term debt  including the current portion  were billion and billion  respectively 
this is compared with a carrying value and estimated fair value of billion and billion  respectively  as of june  these estimated fair values are based on level inputs

notes the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 
convertible debt in june  we issued billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on june  in a private placement offering 
proceeds from the offering were billion  net of fees and expenses  which were capitalized 
initially  each  principal amount of notes was convertible into shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the conversion ratio is adjusted periodically for dividends in excess of the initial dividend threshold as defined in the debt agreement 
as of june   the net carrying amount of our convertible debt was billion and the unamortized discount was million 
prior to march   the notes will be convertible  only in certain circumstances  into cash and  if applicable  cash  shares of microsoft s common stock  or a combination thereof  at our election 
on or after march   the notes will be convertible at any time 
upon conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election 
because the convertible debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash  we are required to separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods 
the net proceeds of billion were allocated between debt for billion and stockholders equity for million with the portion in stockholders equity representing the fair value of the option to convert the debt 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of the notes or their affiliates 
the capped call transactions are expected to 
table of contents part ii item reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon conversion of the notes 
under the capped call transactions  we purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common stock underlying the notes  with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes and with an initial cap price equal to  which is adjusted periodically to mirror any adjustments to the conversion price 
the purchased capped calls were valued at million and recorded to stockholders equity 
unearned revenue unearned revenue at june  comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs 
unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period 
unearned revenue at june  also included payments for post delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future  xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points  the windows upgrade offer  microsoft dynamics business solutions products  skype prepaid credits and subscriptions  oem minimum commitments  and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software  or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 
the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june  in millions three months ending  september  december  march  june  thereafter total share repurchases on september   we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september  as of june   approximately billion remained of the billion approved repurchase amount 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice 
during the periods reported  we repurchased with cash resources million shares for billion during fiscal year  million shares for billion during fiscal year  and million shares for billion during fiscal year dividends during fiscal years and  our board of directors declared the following dividends declaration date dividend per share record date total amount payment date in millions fiscal year september  november   december  december  february   march  march  may   june  june  august   september  fiscal year september  november   december  december  february   march  march  may   june  june  august   september  
table of contents part ii item off balance sheet arrangements we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters 
in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications  we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued in our financial statements any liabilities related to these indemnifications

e we have excluded long term tax contingencies  other tax liabilities  and deferred income taxes of billion and other long term contingent liabilities of million related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits from the amounts presented  as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain 
we have also excluded unearned revenue of billion and non cash items of million 
other planned uses of capital on july   we acquired yammer  inc yammer  a leading provider of enterprise social networks  for billion in cash 
yammer will continue to develop its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking service to microsoft s portfolio of complementary cloud based services 
we will continue to invest in sales  marketing  product support infrastructure  and existing and advanced areas of technology 
additions to property and equipment will continue  including new facilities  data centers  and computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  support  and administrative staff 
we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment 
we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
liquidity we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  as discussed above under cash  cash equivalents  and investments  
table of contents part ii item the majority of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries 
we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
we expect existing domestic cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as regular quarterly dividends  debt repayment schedules  and material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we expect existing foreign cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities  such as material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically  for example to fund significant discretionary activities  such as business acquisitions and share repurchases  we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  increased interest expense  or dilution of our earnings 
we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates 
recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting guidance on july   we adopted guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb on disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the guidance requires the disclosure of roll forward activities on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
on january   we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
additionally  the guidance expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set off  amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed  and the related net exposure 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  other than requiring additional disclosures  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and 
table of contents part ii item other comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this portion of the guidance will be effective for us beginning july  and will require financial statement presentation changes only 
the new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
however  in december  the fasb issued guidance that indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  goodwill  research and development costs  contingencies  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition software revenue recognition requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
windows revenue is subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer  which started june  the offer provides significantly discounted rights to purchase windows pro to qualifying end users that purchase windows pcs during the eligibility period 
microsoft is responsible for delivering windows pro to the end customer 
accordingly  revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows is deferred until it is delivered or the redemption period expires 
impairment of investment securities we review investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  credit quality of debt instrument issuers  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and for equity securities  our intent and ability to hold  or plans to sell  the investment 
for fixed income securities  we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 

table of contents part ii item application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results  market conditions  and other factors 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
generally  this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 

table of contents part ii item statement of management s responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  equity prices  and commodity prices 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but they may impact our financial statements 
foreign currency certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
interest rate our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices 
in addition  we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage backed securities 
equity our equity portfolio consists of global  developed  and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk 
we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
commodity we use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification 
our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities  including precious metals  energy  and grain 
we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
value at risk we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices  and commodity prices  assuming normal market conditions 
the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  and legal risk
