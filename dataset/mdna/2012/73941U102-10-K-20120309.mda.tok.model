item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on transforming medicines that can transform lives 
we operate a business model that focuses on the following developing innovative products that address unmet medical needs in the marketplace  obtaining patents for those innovative ideas which we believe have value in the marketplace  utilizing a small group of talented employees to develop those ideas by working with strategic outsource partners  developing a regulatory pathway with the appropriate agency  and determining how best to commercialize our products 

table of contents we hire experts with strong project management skills in the specific disciplines we believe are important to maintain within our company 
we contract with and manage strong outsource partners as we complete the necessary development work  permitting us to avoid incurring the cost of buying or building laboratories  manufacturing facilities or clinical research operation sites 
this allows us to control our annual expenses  but to utilize best in class resources as required 
we have decided to retain ownership of our pa product candidates which contain a combination of a proton pump inhibitor and enteric coated aspirin in a single tablet through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage and have hired a chief commercial officer who is responsible for developing the commercialization strategy for these products and conducting all the required pre commercialization activities 
we have refined our commercialization strategy and in the united states  we intend to find a commercial partner who will allow us to play a significant role in all commercialization efforts 
outside the united states  we intend to secure relationships with one or more strong commercial partners with relevant expertise to commercialize our future products globally 
we have retained keelin reeds llc to assist us in the strategic partner search for pa for both the us and globally 
keelin reeds is a global expert in helping life sciences companies value pipeline assets  develop business development strategies and execute partnership transactions 
the success of our business is highly dependent on the marketplace value of our ideas and the related patents we obtain  our ability to obtain from the required regulatory agencies approval to sell the developed products and our ability to find strong commercial partners to successfully commercialize the products 
we have previously developed treximet in collaboration with glaxosmithkline  or gsk 
treximet is the brand name for the product combining sumatriptan mg  formulated with rt technology and naproxen sodium mg in a single tablet designed for the acute treatment of migraine 
on april   the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
upon receipt of fda approval  gsk notified us of its intention to launch the product and treximet was available in pharmacies in may treximet incorporates our mt technology  which refers to our proprietary combinations of a triptan htb d agonist and a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug  or nsaid 
under our mt technology  we sought to develop product candidates that provide acute migraine therapy by combining the activity of two drugs that act by different mechanisms to reduce the pain and associated symptoms of migraine 
we filed the new drug application  or nda  for treximet with the fda in august  and in june we received an approvable letter requiring us to provide certain additional safety information relating to treximet  some of which required new studies 
an approvable letter is an official notification from the fda that contains conditions that must be satisfied prior to obtaining final us marketing approval 
in early january  we delivered a full response to this approvable letter that provided additional data and analyses and supporting information addressing the fda s safety concerns  including cardiovascular safety 
on august   we received a second approvable letter from the fda for treximet in which the fda requested that we further address the fda s concern about the product s potential for genotoxicity 
in response to this approvable letter  we submitted the results of three non clinical in vitro studies that provided clarifying information about the chinese hamster ovary  or cho  assay and data from a clinical evaluation of the genotoxic potential of treximet in human volunteers which indicated that no chromosomal aberrations were induced in peripheral blood lymphocytes when treximet was administered to volunteers for seven days 
on april   the fda approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
on november   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with cppib credit investments inc or cii  pursuant to which we sold  and cii purchased  our right to receive future royalty payments arising from us sales of mt  including treximet 
under the purchase agreement  we received a purchase price of million and will receive a twenty percent interest in any royalties received by cii relating to the period commencing on april  under the purchase agreement  cii has assumed financial responsibility for and will receive the proceeds  if any  from our outstanding patent litigation concerning treximet against par  alphapharm  and dr 
reddy s which is now on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit and our patent litigation against sun pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
we have developed vimovo with astrazeneca ab  or astrazeneca 
vimovo formerly referred to as pn is the brand name for a proprietary fixed dose combination of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen in a single tablet 
on april   the fda approved vimovo for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  or oa  rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  and ankylosing spondylitis  or as  and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
in august  we entered into an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca to co develop and commercialize vimovo  which agreement was amended in september and october we began the phase program in september as part of the program  we conducted two phase pivotal trials of vimovo in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers  the primary endpoint for which was the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  the fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for pozen s clinical programs 
the fda decided to obtain further advice on this issue and held a meeting of its gastrointestinal advisory board advisory board on november   to discuss the adequacy of endoscopically documented gastric ulcers as an outcome measure to evaluate drugs intended to prevent gastrointestinal complications of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  including aspirin 
the advisory board voted in favor that endoscopically documented gastric duodenal ulcers are an adequate primary efficacy endpoint for evaluating products intended to prevent nsaid associated upper gastrointestinal ugi toxicity 

table of contents based upon the fda s earlier confirmation that endoscopic gastric ulcers were an acceptable primary endpoint  the two pivotal trials were completed and met their primary endpoints 
in both trials  patients taking vimovo experienced significantly p fewer endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers compared to subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen during the six month treatment period with gastric ulcer incidence rates of and for vimovo and and for enteric coated naproxen in studies and  respectively 
data combined from both studies showed that in patients taking low dose aspirin n  the incidence of gastric ulcers in the vimovo arm was compared to for those taking ec naproxen p and patients taking vimovo who were not taking low dose aspirin n experienced a incidence of gastric ulcers compared to among those taking ec naproxen p 
additional analyses examined the incidence of endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcers among patients taking vimovo 
in study  patients taking vimovo experienced a incidence of duodenal ulcers compared to taking ec naproxen p  and in study  patients taking vimovo experienced a incidence of duodenal ulcers  compared to incidence among patients taking ec naproxen p 
the most frequently reported adverse events among patients taking both vimovo and enteric coated naproxen in the pivotal trials were gi disorders  including dyspepsia  erosive esophagitis and erosive duodenitis 
in addition to the phase pivotal trials  we have completed a long term  open label safety study 
in we terminated a non pivotal smaller study in patients at high risk of gastrointestinal related events from nsaids which we believe is not required for approval 
we also conducted additional studies at astrazeneca s expense 
the nda for vimovo was submitted on june  and was accepted for filing by fda in august pozen received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in september for the achievement of such milestone 
in october  astrazeneca submitted a marketing authorization application  or maa  for vimovo in the european union  or eu  via the decentralized procedure  or dcp  and has filed or plans to file for approval in a number of other countries which are not covered by the dcp 
on october  we announced with astrazeneca that vimovo had received positive agreement for approval in countries across the eu following all concerned member states agreeing with the assessment of the netherlands health authority meb  acting as the reference member state for the dcp 
we received a million milestone payment when pricing and reimbursement for vimovo was granted in the united kingdom 
other member states and countries worldwide are now pursuing pricing and reimbursement and national approvals 
earlier  in may  we had received a million milestone payment when we received fda approval of vimovo 
our pa product candidates  containing a combination of a ppi and aspirin  are currently in formulation and clinical development testing 
our pa product candidates are excluded from our agreement with astrazeneca 
we have met with the fda to discuss the overall development program requirements for pa for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients at risk for gastric ulcers 
an investigational new drug application  or ind  was filed in the fourth quarter of we have completed a study which demonstrated that the sa component of pa was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec aspirin 
we filed a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the fda for the design of the phase studies for the product  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
the spa is a process by which the fda and a company reach agreement on the phase pivotal trial protocol design  clinical endpoints and statistical analyses that are acceptable to support regulatory approval 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  the fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical programs 
in february  we received written confirmation from the fda that endoscopic gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for the phase clinical studies we proposed in our spa for pa the fda decided to obtain further advice on this issue and held a meeting of its advisory board on november  to discuss the adequacy of endoscopically documented gastric ulcers as an outcome measure to evaluate drugs intended to prevent gastrointestinal complications of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  including aspirin 
the advisory board voted in favor that endoscopically documented gastric duodenal ulcers are an adequate primary efficacy endpoint for evaluating products intended to prevent nsaid associated upper gastrointestinal ugi toxicity  which vote supports the clinical design of the pivotal phase trials 
based upon the fda s earlier confirmation that endoscopic gastric ulcers were an acceptable primary endpoint  in october  we began two pivotal phase and one long term safety study for pa for the cardiovascular indication 
the primary endpoint of the pivotal studies  which will include approximately subjects per study  is the cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers over the six month treatment period 
enrollment of both trials has been completed 
the one year  long term safety study  which included approximately subjects  was completed earlier this year 
top line results from the long term safety study show adverse events consistent with what would be expected in this population requiring cardio aspirin therapy and with the known safety profile of the pa components 
in  fda has requested an additional phase study to assess the bioequivalence of pa to ec aspirin mg with respect to acetylsalicylic acid asa 
enteric coated products such as pa and ec aspirin mg have highly variable pharmacokinetics so there is a risk that this phase study may not demonstrate bioequivalence 
we believe that by demonstrating bioequivalence to a marketed aspirin product will allow our pa product to receive the appropriate cardio and cerebrovascular secondary prevention claims of aspirin 
we anticipate filing an nda in 
table of contents we are aware of changes to the plavix label that contain data regarding a drug drug interaction between clopidogrel plavix  a widely prescribed anti platelet agent  and certain enteric coated proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole 
the current plavix label includes a statement in the warnings and precautions section to avoid concomitant use of plavix with drugs that are strong or moderate cypc inhibitors such as omeprazole 
in addition  the current prilosec label  in the warnings and precautions section  states that co administration of plavix with mg of omeprazole  a ppi that is a strong inhibitor of cypc  reduces the pharmacological activity of plavix if given concomitantly or if given hour apart 
these fda warnings were based  in part  on two crossover clinical studies of healthy subjects administered plavix alone and with mg ec omeprazole  either together or administered hours apart 
to assess whether a similar interaction occurs between clopidogrel and pa  which contains immediate release omeprazole  we have completed two phase drug drug interaction study to evaluate the ex vivo platelet aggregation effects of pa plus clopidogrel 
in the first study  we evaluated ex vivo platelet aggregation of pa plus clopidogrel when dosed at the same time or dosed hours apart compared to aspirin mg plus clopidogrel dosed together 
when pa and clopidogrel were dosed together  data from the study showed a mean platelet inhibition compared to a mean platelet inhibition when aspirin and clopidogrel were dosed together suggesting a drug drug interaction based on the study s pre specified primary analysis 
when pa and clopidogrel were dosed hours apart  data from the study indicate no ex vivo drug drug interaction based on the study s pre specified primary analysis 
in the second phase study  we evaluated ex vivo platelet aggregation of pa plus clopidogrel dosed hour apart compared to a current standard of care of plavix prilosec mg ec asa mg dosed together 
subjects on pa demonstrated significantly greater inhibition of platelet aggregation than subjects on standard of care 
the clinical relevance of these ex vivo platelet data on cardiovascular events is not known 
no further phase studies on the clopidogrel ppi interaction are planned 
fda assessment of available data on the drug drug interaction may result in the inclusion of a warning  similar to that in the current prilosec label  against the concomitant use of pa and plavix 
we are also continuing to evaluate how best to commercialize the pa product candidates and programs and have hired a chief commercial officer to evaluate the commercial opportunities for these product candidates 
we are also conducting both formulation development and early stage clinical studies with other pa product candidates for indications in addition to secondary prevention of cardiovascular events 
we are evaluating the regulatory requirements to obtain an indication for pa for the secondary prevention of colorectal neoplasia 
in january  we received input from the fda with respect to the development requirements for a possible indication in colorectal neoplasia 
further discussions are being considered 
we are also evaluating the possibility of developing another dosage strength of pa for the treatment of osteoarthritis and similar conditions and we met with the fda in december to obtain input with respect to the regulatory requirements to obtain such an indication 
in addition  we continue to evaluate the commercial potential of such a product 
we may conduct further studies for these and other pa indications when adequate funds are available 
we are also conducting both formulation development and early stage clinical studies with new product concepts that are currently in the exploratory stage 
if warranted  we may file us and international patent applications with claims directed toward these novel combinations and formulations 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not yet generated significant revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we record revenue under the following categories royalty revenues  licensing revenues and development revenues 
our licensing revenues include upfront payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development or commercialization are reached  while the royalty payments are based on product sales 
additionally  our development revenues include the billings for the direct costs and certain personnel related time incurred in performing additional development activities described under our collaboration agreements 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for our product candidates and sales  general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct development costs  which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  costs relating to preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  and clinical trials  and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates 
since inception  our research and development expenses have represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
for the fiscal year ended december   our research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses 

table of contents operating losses may be incurred over the next several years as we complete the development and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates  develop other product candidates  conduct pre commercialization activities  and acquire and or develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of our pa product candidates and our other product candidates in the clinical and regulatory process  the ability of astrazeneca to successfully commercialize vimovo globally  the establishment of new collaborations and progress and or maintenance of our existing collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  our ability to successfully defend our regulatory market exclusivity and patent rights against generic challenges and to succeed in obtaining extensions of such exclusivity for which we may be eligible  our ability to commercialize our products with commercial partners in a highly regulated and extremely competitive marketplace  and the acquisition and or in licensing  and development of our therapeutic product candidates 
we do not currently have internal commercialization or manufacturing capabilities 
we have entered into collaborations and may continue to enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates once approved 
we have decided to retain control of our pa product candidates through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage 
to that end  we have hired a chief commercial officer to evaluate the commercial opportunities for these product candidates and to develop a worldwide commercial strategy  which will include developing internal commercialization capabilities to enable us to play a significant role in the commercialization of our products with commercial partners 
our ability to generate revenue in the near term is dependent upon our ability  alone or with collaborators  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements  to enter into additional collaboration agreements  to successfully develop product candidates  to obtain regulatory approvals and to successfully manufacture and commercialize our future products 
these milestones are earned when we have satisfied the criteria set out in our revenue recognition footnote accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these payments generate large non recurring revenue that will cause large fluctuations in quarterly and annual profit and loss 
status and expenses related to our products and product candidates there follows a brief discussion of the status of the development of our approved products and our product candidates  as well as the costs relating to our development activities 
our direct research and development expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  our research and development expenses that are not direct development costs consist of personnel and other research and development departmental costs and are not allocated by product candidate 
we generally do not maintain records that allocate our employees time by the projects on which they work and  therefore  are unable to identify costs related to the time that employees spend on research and development by product candidate 
total compensation and benefit costs for our personnel involved in research and development were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  total compensation included a million  a million  and a million charge for non cash compensation for stock option expense for fiscal years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
other research and development department costs were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
treximet 
on april   the fda approved treximet for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults 
gsk notified us of its intention to launch the product and treximet was available in pharmacies in may as part of our nda program for treximet  we conducted five phase trials  two phase pivotal trials  and one month open label safety trial using a formulation of treximet developed by gsk 
the phase pivotal trials  including the endpoints required to evaluate treximet  were designed to demonstrate superiority to placebo for relief of pain and the associated symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia at two hours 
additionally  the program was designed to demonstrate that each component makes a contribution to the efficacy of treximet the combination drug rule that the fda requires of all combination products 
the efficacy endpoint for the combination was sustained pain free  which is defined as improvement from moderate or severe pain to no pain at two hours and remaining at no pain through twenty four hours without the use of rescue medicine 
further  gsk has conducted market support studies for treximet  including evaluations in a pediatric population 
as required by the terms of our agreement with gsk  we transferred ownership of the nda and other regulatory filings for treximet to gsk on may   and gsk now has responsibility for all ongoing regulatory obligations for the product  including post marketing clinical trial requirements 

table of contents we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt and treximet programs of  for the fiscal year ended december  we incurred total direct development costs of million associated with the development of our mt and treximet programs 
we recorded in the fiscal year ended december   million of treximet royalty revenue 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
we  along with gsk have received paragraph iv notice letters from par  alphapharm  teva  and dr 
reddy s  informing us that each had filed an anda  with the fda seeking approval to market sumatriptan mg naproxen sodium mg tablets 
par  alphapharm  teva  and dr 
reddy s each indicated in their respective notice letters that they intend to market a generic version of treximet tablets before the expiration of the patent  patent and the patent listed with respect to treximet in orange book 
gsk advised us that it elected not to exercise its first right to bring infringement suits against par  alphapharm  teva  and dr 
reddy s 
accordingly  we filed suit against par on november   alphapharm and mylan on january   teva  on april   and dr 
reddy s on august   all in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
on april   we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with teva 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  teva was dismissed without prejudice from the consolidated litigation currently pending  but agreed to be bound by the outcome of such litigation or any resulting settlements with third parties 
on august   we announced that on august   the district court ruled the patent and the patent to be valid  enforceable and infringed by par  alphapharm and dr 
reddy s 
a third patent  the patent  covering the treximet formulation was held to be valid  enforceable and infringed by par and dr 
reddy s 
the patent was not asserted against alphapharm 
the district court also ordered that defendants andas not be approved by the fda until  with respect to par and dr 
reddy s  at least the expiration of the on october   and with respect to alphapharm the expiration of the and patents on august  on september   we announced that par  alphapharm  and dr 
reddy s had each appealed the decision of the district court to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
on april   we and gsk received a paragraph iv notice letter from sun pharma global fze sun informing us that sun had filed an anda  with the fda seeking approval to market a generic version of treximet tablets before the expiration of  and patents 
sun s paragraph iv notice letter asserts that its generic product will not infringe the listed patents or that the listed patents are invalid or unenforceable 
on may   we filed suit against sun for patent infringement in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
we amended its complaint on november  to include the patent  which was listed in the orange book subsequent to the filing of the suit 
on november   we entered into the purchase agreement with cii  pursuant to which we sold  and cii purchased  our right to receive future royalty payments arising from us sales of mt  including treximet 
under the purchase agreement  cii shall assume financial responsibility for and receive the proceeds  if any  from our outstanding patent litigation concerning treximet against par  alphapharm  and dr 
reddy s which is now on appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit  and our patent litigation against sun pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas 
on march   we entered into a license agreement with cilag gmbh international  or cilag  a division of johnson johnson  for the exclusive development and commercialization of mt in brazil  colombia  ecuador and peru 
under the terms of the agreement  cilag made a nominal  initial upfront payment  which is refundable under certain conditions  and that payment to be followed by a nominal milestone payment upon the approval of mt by the national health surveillance agency of brazil 
we will also receive a high single digit royalty on net sales of mt during the first years of sales  followed by a low single digit royalty during the next years 
cilag will be responsible for the manufacturing  development and commercialization of mt pn vimovo program 
under our pn program  we completed formulation development and clinical studies for several combinations of a ppi and a nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective management of pain and inflammation associated with chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis  and intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to a nsaid taken alone in patients at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we initially conducted studies with two pn product formulations in this program pn  a combination of the ppi lansoprazole and the nsaid naproxen  and pn  a combination of the ppi omeprazole and naproxen  prior to entering into our collaboration with astrazeneca 
our present development and commercialization efforts under the pn program are covered under our exclusive collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  which we entered into on august  and which was amended in september and october our agreement with astrazeneca covers the development and commercialization of proprietary fixed dose combinations of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen in a single tablet 
the initial product developed under the agreement  vimovo formerly pn  was approved by the fda on april  for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 

table of contents in discussions with the fda during regarding our development plans for studies to pursue fda approval of pn and pn  the fda agreed that by including naproxen as the nsaid within the pn formulation  we could expect that all indications for chronic use of naproxen in adults would accrue to the pn product  if clinical trials successfully demonstrated improved safety lower incidence of gastric ulcers of the pn product compared with naproxen alone and the pn formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to marketed formulations of enteric coated  or ec  naproxen 
prior to entering into our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we completed a study designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the naproxen component of our pn product candidate development formulation to ec naproxen 
this study demonstrated that the pn product was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec naprosyn  with respect to the naproxen component 
in early  we submitted an spa to the fda for our pivotal phase clinical trials for pn the spa is a process in which the fda provides evaluations and guidance on clinical trial protocols for pivotal phase clinical trials 
in april  we announced that we had reached an agreement with the fda on the phase pivotal clinical trials for pn for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we also reached agreement with the fda that the development program and study design proposed for pn would be applicable to a product that contained an isomer of omeprazole combined with naproxen 
in light of our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we  along with astrazeneca met with the fda and confirmed the core development program and the principles in the spa already agreed upon do apply to the new product consisting of proprietary fixed dose combinations of esomeprazole magnesium with naproxen 
in the third quarter of  we began recruiting subjects for a six month comparative trial of pn as compared to ec naproxen in patients requiring chronic nsaid therapy 
the primary endpoint for the trial was the cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers over six months of treatment 
because we did not have final results until the fourth quarter of  we  together with astrazeneca reviewed the interim results of this trial prior to commencing phase studies of vimovo in september this study has now been completed and the results which have been presented publicly indicated significantly fewer endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers during the six month treatment period in subjects on pn compared to subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen alone 
on march   we filed an ind with the fda for vimovo and in april  the first phase study was initiated 
we conducted two phase pivotal trials of vimovo in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  the fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical programs 
the fda decided to obtain further advice on this issue and held an advisory board meeting on november  to discuss the adequacy of endoscopically documented gastric ulcers as an outcome measure to evaluate drugs intended to prevent gastrointestinal complications of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  including aspirin 
the advisory board voted in favor that endoscopically documented gastric duodenal ulcers are an adequate primary efficacy endpoint for evaluating products intended to prevent nsaid associated upper gastrointestinal  or ugi  toxicity 
based upon the fda s earlier confirmation that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint  the two pivotal trials were completed and met their primary endpoints 
in both trials  patients taking vimovo experienced significantly p fewer endoscopically confirmed gastric ulcers compared to subjects receiving enteric coated naproxen during the six month treatment period  with gastric ulcer incidence rates of and for vimovo and and for enteric coated naproxen in studies and  respectively 
data combined from both studies showed that in patients taking low dose aspirin n  the incidence of gastric ulcers in the vimovo arm was compared to for those taking ec naproxen p and patients taking vimovo who were not taking low dose aspirin n experienced a incidence of gastric ulcers compared to among those taking ec naproxen p 
additional analyses examined the incidence of endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcers among patients taking vimovo 
in study  patients taking vimovo experienced a incidence of duodenal ulcers compared to taking ec naproxen p  and in study  patients taking vimovo experienced a incidence of duodenal ulcers  compared to incidence among patients taking ec naproxen p 
the most frequently reported adverse events among patients taking both vimovo and enteric coated naproxen in the pivotal trials were gi disorders  including dyspepsia  erosive esophagitis and erosive duodenitis 
in addition  we conducted a long term  open label safety study for vimovo 
we also conducted additional studies at astrazeneca s expense 
the nda for vimovo was submitted on june  and was accepted for filing in august we received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in september for the achievement of such milestone 
on april   vimovo was approved by fda for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis and to decrease the risk of developing gastric ulcers in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we received a million milestone payment from astrazeneca in may in connection with such approval 
as required by the terms of our agreement with astrazeneca  we transferred ownership of the nda and other regulatory filings for vimovo to astrazeneca on june   and astrazeneca now has responsibility for all ongoing regulatory obligations for the product in the us  including post marketing clinical trial requirements  in addition to responsibility for all regulatory obligations outside the us 
table of contents additionally  we met with four national european regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pn 
under our agreement with astrazeneca  astrazeneca has responsibility for the development program for pn products outside the us  including interactions with regulatory agencies 
in october  astrazeneca submitted a maa for vimovo in the eu via the dcp and has filed and plans to file for approval in a number of other countries which are not covered by the dcp 
on october   we announced with astrazeneca that vimovo had received positive agreement for approval in countries across the eu following all concerned member states agreeing with the assessment of the netherlands health authority  acting as the reference member state for the dcp 
we received a million milestone payment when pricing and reimbursement for vimovo was granted in the united kingdom

on september   we and astrazeneca ab received a paragraph iv notice letter from anchen pharmaceuticals  inc  informing us that anchen had filed an anda with the fda seeking regulatory approval to market a generic version of vimovo before the expiration of the patent  the patent  the patent  and the patent 
the patents are among those listed with respect to vimovo in the orange book and expire at various times between and anchen s paragraph iv notice letter asserts that its generic product will not infringe those five listed patents or that those five listed patents are invalid or unenforceable 
astrazeneca has advised us that it has elected to exercise its first right to prosecute the infringement suit against anchen and  accordingly  we and astrazeneca filed suit against anchen on october  in the united states district court for the district of new jersey we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pn program of  for the fiscal year ended december  we incurred total direct development cost of million associated with the development of our pn program of which million was funded by development revenue from astrazeneca 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expense 
pa program 
as part of our pa program  we are exploring the development of a combination of a ppi and aspirin in a single tablet 
similar to the pn program  our pa product candidate is intended to induce fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an aspirin taken alone in patients at risk for developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers 
our pa product candidates are covered under the same patent as pn  but we have retained all rights to this program through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage 

table of contents our initial pa product candidate  pa  is currently in clinical development 
we completed a phase proof of concept study in canada of an earlier formulation of pa containing mg of aspirin and mg of omeprazole pa in the first quarter of the primary endpoint was gastrointestinal damage as measured by the lanza scoring system used in our previous pn studies 
the results were highly significant p with of the pa group having lanza or gastrointestinal damage  whereas of the ec aspirin group had this level of gastrointestinal damage during the day study 
we also completed a second proof of concept study with pa as compared to mg of ec aspirin 
these results confirmed the earlier levels of gastric damage as measured by lanza scoring at about for pa while these results in the second study were numerically different between treatment groups  they did not achieve statistical significance from the results obtained with mg ec aspirin 
after reviewing these data  we decided to increase the dose of omeprazole to mg per tablet and conduct an additional day phase study using the formulation containing mg of immediate release of omeprazole and mg of aspirin pa compared to mg ec aspirin 
topline results from this study indicate a highly significant p reduction in gastrointestinal damage with the higher strength pa tablet as compared with mg ec aspirin vs 
grade or lanza scores  respectively 
additionally  of subjects treated with the pa tablet showed no gastrointestinal damage at all  whereas of subjects treated showed no gastrointestinal damage at all with the pa tablet 
an ind for the product was filed in the fourth quarter of and we met with the fda in july to discuss the overall development program requirements 
we have completed a study which demonstrated that the salicylic acid sa component of pa was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec aspirin 
in june  we filed an spa with the fda for our pivotal phase trials for pa  the primary endpoint for which is the reduction in endoscopic gastric ulcers 
in october  the fda informed us that it was conducting an internal review of the acceptability of using endoscopic gastric ulcers as a primary endpoint in clinical trials 
in late january  the fda informed us that it had completed its internal discussions and that there was no change to previous agreements that gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable primary endpoint for our clinical programs and in february  we received written confirmation from the fda that endoscopic gastric ulcer incidence was an acceptable endpoint for the phase clinical studies we proposed in our spa for pa the fda decided to obtain further advice on this issue and held an advisory board meeting on november  to discuss the adequacy of endoscopically documented gastric ulcers as an outcome measure to evaluate drugs intended to prevent gastrointestinal complications of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  including aspirin 
the advisory board voted in favor that endoscopically documented gastric duodenal ulcers are an adequate primary efficacy endpoint for evaluating products intended to prevent nsaid associated upper gastrointestinal ugi toxicity  which vote supports the clinical design of the pivotal phase trials evaluating pa based upon the fda s earlier confirmation that endoscopic gastric were an acceptable primary endpoint  in october  we began two pivotal phase and one long term safety study for pa for the cardiovascular indication 
the primary endpoint of the pivotal studies  which included approximately subjects per study  is the cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers over the six month treatment period 

enrollment of both trials has been completed 
the one year  long term safety study  which included approximately subjects  was completed earlier this year 
top line results from the long term safety study show adverse events consistent with what would be expected in this population requiring cardio aspirin therapy and with the known safety profile of the pa components 
in  the fda requested that we perform an additional phase study to assess the bioequivalence of pa to ec aspirin mg with respect to acetylsalicylic acid asa 
enteric coated products such as pa and ec aspirin mg have highly variable pharmacokinetics 
as a result  there is a risk that this phase study may not demonstrate bioequivalence 
however  if successful  we believe that by demonstrating bioequivalence to a marketed aspirin product  our pa product will likely receive the appropriate cardio and cerebrovascular secondary prevention claims of aspirin 
we have initiated this additional phase study and anticipate filing an nda in we are aware of changes to the plavix label that contain data regarding a drug drug interaction between clopidogrel plavix  a widely prescribed anti platelet agent  and certain enteric coated proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole 
the current plavix label includes a statement in the warnings and precautions section to avoid concomitant use of plavix with drugs that are strong or moderate cypc inhibitors such as omeprazole 
in addition  the current prilosec label  in the warnings and precautions section  states that co administration of plavix with mg of omeprazole  a ppi that is a strong inhibitor of cypc  reduces the pharmacological activity of plavix if given concomitantly or if given hour apart 
these fda warnings were based  in part  on two crossover clinical studies of healthy subjects administered plavix alone and with mg ec omeprazole  either together or administered hours apart 
to assess whether a similar interaction occurs between clopidogrel and pa  which contains immediate release omeprazole  we have completed two phase drug drug interaction study to evaluate the ex vivo platelet aggregation effects of pa plus clopidogrel 
in the first study  we evaluated ex vivo platelet aggregation of pa plus clopidogrel when dosed at the same time or dosed hours apart compared to aspirin mg plus clopidogrel dosed together 
when pa and clopidogrel were dosed together  data from the study showed a mean platelet inhibition compared to a mean platelet inhibition when aspirin and clopidogrel were dosed together suggesting a drug drug interaction based on the study s pre specified primary analysis 
when pa and clopidogrel were dosed hours apart  data from the study indicate no ex vivo drug drug interaction based on the study s pre specified primary analysis 
in the second phase study  we evaluated ex vivo platelet aggregation of pa plus clopidogrel dosed hour apart compared to a current standard of care of plavix prilosec mg ec asa mg dosed together 
subjects on pa demonstrated significantly greater inhibition of platelet aggregation than subjects on standard of care 
the clinical relevance of these ex vivo platelet data on cardiovascular events is not known 
no further phase studies on the clopidogrel ppi interaction are planned 
fda assessment of available data on the drug drug interaction may result in the inclusion of a warning  similar to that in the current prilosec  label against the concomitant of pa and plavix 

table of contents we are also continuing to evaluate how best to commercialize the pa product candidates and programs and have hired a chief commercial officer to evaluate the commercial opportunities for these product candidates 
we are also conducting both formulation development and early stage clinical studies with other pa product candidates for indications in addition to secondary prevention of cardiovascular events 
we are evaluating the regulatory requirements to obtain an indication for pa for the secondary prevention of colorectal neoplasia 
in january  we received input from fda with respect to the development requirements for a possible indication in colorectal neoplasia 
further discussions are being considered 
we are also evaluating the possibility of developing another dosage strength of pa for the treatment of osteoarthritis and similar conditions and met with the fda in december to obtain input with respect to the regulatory requirements to obtain such an indication 
in addition  we continue to evaluate the commercial potential of such a product 
we may to conduct further studies for these and other pa indications when adequate funds are available 
additionally  we have met with several regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pa 
each of these regulatory agencies has indicated that reduction in gastric ulcers is an appropriate endpoint for the pivotal trials  along with demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference drug  ec aspirin  with respect to the aspirin component 
seventy five to one hundred mg of aspirin was recommended for the cardiovascular dose of pa to take into phase trials in europe 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any pa product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any pa products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we have refined our strategy and decided to retain control of our pa product candidates through the clinical development and pre commercialization stage and then seek strong commercial partners to maximize the potential of these product candidates 
we believe value is added to the pa product candidates as progress is made through clinical development and  if we ultimately chose to partner the products later in the development program or after approval  either outside the united states or on a global basis  we believe it would be under economic terms more favorable to us 
we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pa program of million during the fiscal year ended december  we incurred total direct development cost of million associated with the development of our pa program 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we have critical accounting estimates in the following policy areas revenue recognition  accrued expenses  stock based compensation  fair value measurements and income taxes 
revenue recognition we record revenue under the following categories royalty revenues  licensing revenues and development revenues 

table of contents licensing revenue for the years ended december   and consisted of the following royalty revenue and other licensing revenue for the year ended december  sale of royalty right  net of costs royalty revenue other licensing revenue total licensing revenue with regard to licensing revenue  treximet royalty was and vimovo royalty revenue is recognized when earned  as will any other future royalty revenues with respect to the manufacture  sale or use of the company s products or technology 
for treximet and vimovo or those future arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  the company recognizes revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and reflect in future revenue any differences between the estimated and actual royalties 
these estimates are based upon information reported to us by our collaboration partners 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  the company recognized million  million and million for treximet  respectively  and for the fiscal years ended december  and  the company recognized million and million for vimovo  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company recognized no royalty revenue for vimovo 
also  with regard to the licensing revenues  the licensing and other collaborative agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development are reached  royalty payments based on future product sales and withdrawal fees if certain conditions are met 
recognition of revenue from non refundable up front payments is deferred by us upon receipt and recognized over the period ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
if regulatory approvals or other events relating to our product candidates are accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for these products would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
milestone payments are recognized as licensing revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if i the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii the fees are non refundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
during the second and fourth quarters of and the third quarter of  we received million  million and million milestone payments  respectively  which were recorded as licensing revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
with regards to the development revenues  our licensing agreements may include payment for development services provided by us on an hourly rate and direct expense basis 
we record such payments as revenue in accordance with the agreements because we act as principal in the transaction 
under the collaboration agreements with astrazeneca and gsk  we recognize as development revenue the billings for the direct costs and certain personnel related time incurred in performing additional development activities described within the related agreements 
the collaboration agreements establish the rates for billing personnel related time incurred and consequently  the associated costs incurred to perform the additional development activities are not separately captured from ongoing personnel costs 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the periods for revenue recognition described above are appropriate  and historical changes in our estimates of these periods have not resulted in material changes in the revenue we recognized 
however  we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
further  if regulatory approval for treximet is accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for this product would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
development revenue and direct billed costs for the years ended december   and were the following year ended december  development revenue direct costs 
table of contents we recognized the remaining deferred revenue balance as of december  of million during the fiscal year ended december  we recognized million from the sale of royalty rights  net of costs  in the fiscal year ended december  we recognized licensing revenue of million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december   respectively 
licensing revenue for the fiscal year ended december  included million royalty revenue for treximet and million vimovo  respectively 
licensing revenue for the fiscal year ended december  included million in milestone payment for the fda s approval of vimovo  million for eu s approval of vimovo  and million royalty revenue for treximet and vimovo 
licensing revenue for the fiscal year ended december  included million in milestone revenue related to the nda acceptance of vimovo and million in royalty revenue for treximet 
accrued expenses  including contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with accrued expenses  including those related to contract costs  such as costs associated with clinical trials 
specifically  the company must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet paid for or not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
the company analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and related activities  invoices received  amounts paid  and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
certain accrued contract costs  estimated to be payable after more than twelve months  are classified as long term liabilities rather than as accrued expenses 
the company believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the extent of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such  paid and unpaid  involves subjective judgments and estimates and often must be based upon information provided by third parties 
in the event that management does not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or under or over estimates the extent of services performed or the costs of such services  management adjusts costs during the period in which the information becomes available 
accrued costs related to product development and operating activities  including clinical trials  based upon the progress of these activities covered by the related contracts  invoices received and estimated costs totaled million at december  and million at december  the variance  at each of these ending periods  between the actual expenses incurred and the estimated expenses accrued was not material or significant 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes model to value service condition and performance condition option awards 
for awards with only service conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions granted we recognize compensation cost over the expected period to achieve the performance conditions  provided achievement of the performance conditions are deemed probable 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
our expected volatility rate was estimated based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of our common stock over a six year period 
the expected term we use was estimated based on average historical terms to exercise 
the risk free interest rate is based on seven year us treasury securities 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate used for the year ended december  was based on actual historical rates 
determining the appropriate amount to expense for performance based awards based on the achievement of stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future performance results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revisions is reflected in the period of change 
if any applicable financial performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
fair value measurement under fasb asc  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  we use various valuation approaches  including quoted market prices and discounted cash flows 
the fair value hierarchy for inputs maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect a company s judgment concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available under the circumstances 
the fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows 
table of contents level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that the company is able to access 
since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market  valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment 
level valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for instruments that are similar  or quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar instruments  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the financial assets for which we perform recurring measurements are cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   financial assets utilizing level inputs included cash equivalents and short term investments 
financial assets utilizing level inputs included short term investments in government agency obligations and corporate fixed income securities 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
we use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date  including during periods of market dislocation  such as the recent illiquidity in the auction rate securities market 
in periods of market dislocation  the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments 
this condition has caused  and in the future may cause  our financial instruments to be reclassified from level to level or from level to level our level valuations are based on the market approach and consist primarily of quoted prices for identical items on active securities exchanges 
our level valuations also use the market approach and are based on significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for financial instruments not traded on a daily basis 
we did not rely on level input for valuation of our securities at december  the following table sets forth our financial instruments carried at fair value as of december  and december  financial instruments carried at fair value december  december  assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and investments the following table sets forth our financial instruments carried at fair value within the fasb asc hierarchy and using the lowest level of input as of december  financial instruments carried at fair value quoted prices in active markets for identical items significant other observable inputs significant unobservable inputs level level level total assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash and investments realized gains and losses from sales of our investments are included in interest and other income and unrealized gains and losses are included as a separate component of equity unless the loss is determined to be other than temporary 

table of contents in determining whether a decline in fair value below the original cost is other than temporary  we use a systematic methodology that considers all available evidence  including the credit rating of the relevant trust  the parity score a measure of the trust s ability to meet its obligations as they come due  general market conditions  and industry and sector performance  among other factors 
we also consider the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment until recovery or  if necessary  to the instrument s maturity 
when determining whether an impairment is other than temporary we also consider the following information i if the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for an extended period  which we generally define as nine to twelve months  ii if the issuer has experienced significant financial declines  or iii if the issuer has experienced significant changes in its credit quality  among other factors 
the company did not have any other than temporary impairments during the periods presented 
income taxes we estimate an annual effective tax rate of for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended december  however  the actual effective rate may vary depending upon actual fees and payments received  specifically the pre tax book income for the year  and other factors 
income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance with fasb asc since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the tax reform act of  or the act  provides for a limitation on the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the act that could limit our ability to utilize these carryforwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the act  as a result of  among other reasons  past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because tax laws limit the time during which these carryforwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes 
we currently file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and the state of north carolina 
we are no longer subject to federal or north carolina income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before however  the loss carryforwards generated prior to may still be subject to change  if we subsequently begin utilizing these losses in a year that is open under statute and subject to federal or north carolina income tax examinations by tax authorities 
we recognize any interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
during the fiscal year ended december  and  there were no such interest and penalties 
we have been informed by the irs that our tax return has been selected for audit with primary focus on tax treatments of milestone payments 
all milestone payments for both gsk and az agreements were fully recognized for tax purposes by the end of historical results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income per share net income attributable to common stockholders for the fiscal year ended december  was million  or per share  on a diluted basis  as compared to a net income of million  or per share  on a diluted basis  for the fiscal year ended december  the net income for the fiscal year ended december  included a million  or per share charge for non cash stock based compensation expense as compared to million  or per share for the same period of revenue we recognized total revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  as compared to total revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase of million received from the sale of royalty rights offset by a million decrease in licensing revenue for the fiscal year ended december  compared to licensing revenue for the fiscal year ended december  consisted of million of royalty revenue and million of other licensing revenue compared to million of royalty revenue and million of other licensing revenue for there was no development revenue for fiscal year ended december  as compared to development revenue of  for the fiscal year ended december  our licensing and collaboration agreements have terms that include upfront payments upon contract signing and additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product development or related milestones are achieved 
all upfront payments were deferred and the non refundable portions are being amortized over the periods ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates  or the conclusion of any obligation on our part 
substantive milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon completion of the contractual events 
additionally  our development revenues include the billings for the direct costs and certain personnel related time incurred in performing additional development activities described under our collaboration agreements 
our costs associated with the billed direct costs totaled  and for the fiscal year ended december  there were no direct billed cost for the fiscal year ended december  all costs associated with our development revenues are included in research and development expenses in our statements of operations 
the collaboration agreements establish the rates for billing personnel related time incurred and consequently  the associated costs incurred to perform the additional development activities are not separately captured from ongoing personnel costs 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period of the increase was due primarily to an increase in direct development costs for our pa program  partially offset by a decrease in direct development costs for our exploratory programs  as compared to the same period of direct development costs for the pa program increased by million to million  primarily due to clinical trial activities and other product development activities during the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period of direct development costs for the exploratory programs decreased by million to million

research and development research and development expenses increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period of the increase was due primarily to an increase in direct development costs for our pa program  partially offset by a decrease in direct development costs for our pn program  as compared to the same period of direct development costs for the pa program increased by million to million  primarily due to clinical trial activities and other product development activities during the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period of direct development costs for the exploratory programs decreased by million to million  and the pn program decrease by million to million  as compared to the same period of other direct departmental costs and departmental expenses decreased by million primarily due to decreased personnel costs  as compared to the same period of we have included in our research and development total expenses the departmental personnel costs associated with our research and development activities and direct costs associated with pharmaceutical development  clinical trials  toxicology activities and regulatory matters 

table of contents sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to the same period of the increase was due primarily to increased legal costs for patent defense and marketing research expenses  as compared to the same period of sales  general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development expenses  and public company activities 
other income interest and bond amortization income was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
a research and development grant of million was awarded during the fiscal year ended december  and is included in other income 
income taxes at december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  state net economic loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and  respectively  and the research and development credit carryforwards begin to expire in for financial reporting purposes  a valuation allowance has been recognized to offset the deferred tax assets related to the carryforwards 
of the total decrease in valuation allowance of million  a decrease of million was allocable to current operating activities 
when the valuation allowance is realized  a portion related to excess stock option compensation will be realized as an increase in additional paid in capital 
the utilization of the loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
in addition  the maximum annual use of net operating loss and research credit carryforwards is limited in certain situations where changes occur in stock ownership 
based upon our historic losses  management has recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets 
the actual effective rate may vary depending upon actual licensing fees and other milestone payments received  specifically the pre tax book income for the year  and other factors 
income taxes are computed using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns  in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the tax reform act of the tax reform act limits the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act  as a result of  among other reasons  past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents  along with short term investments  totaled million  an increase of million compared to december  the increase in cash was primarily due to cash received from the treximet royalty monetization and royalty payments received pursuant to the terms of our agreements with astrazeneca and gsk 
our cash is invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks and short term corporate fixed income obligations and us government agency obligations 
short term investments are held in a managed investment account designed to increase the return on our cash 
this account  which is invested as described above  is managed within our board approved investment policy  which restricts investments to maturities of less than twelve months  limits concentration to or less and requires minimum credit ratings of a p  among other requirements 
we have considered the impact of the current economic environment in evaluating the fair value of our investments 
we believe we are adhering to a conservative investment policy 
nonetheless  given the current credit crisis and other market risks  a downgrade in any of our a p investments could result in required action under our investment policy  and may result in an investment loss 

table of contents because certain holdings in the managed account have maturities longer than three months  we have classified these holdings as short term investments in our balance sheets and accounting principles require reporting such investments at market value 
any difference between market value and cost is reported in the stockholders equity section of our financial statements as comprehensive income or loss 
we received million in operating cash during the fiscal year ended december  pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreements with astrazeneca and gsk and our sale of royalty rights 
in addition  our balance sheet included a million accounts receivable for royalties under the astrazeneca agreement 
based upon the indirect method of presenting cash flow  cash provided by operating activities totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended december  totaled million  and net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended december  totaled million reflecting investing activities associated with the purchase and sale of short term securities 
cash required for our operating activities during is projected to increase from our requirements as a result of increased development and pre commercialization activities 
during the fiscal ended december  and december  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock

our operating expenses for and may exceed the net level of our operating expenses in  should we decide to conduct pre commercialization activities as a result of our decision to retain control of our pa product candidate 
we believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves and cash flow to maintain our planned development program for pa and our planned level of business activities  through however  our anticipated cash flow includes continued receipt of royalty revenue from astrazeneca s sale of vimovo but does not include any clinical milestone payments 
in addition  our expenses might increase during that period beyond currently expected levels if we decide to  or any regulatory agency requires us to  conduct additional clinical trials  studies or investigations for any of our product candidates  including in connection with the agency s consideration  or reconsideration  of our regulatory filings for our product candidates 
if our projected revenues decrease  we may need to raise additional capital 
additionally  if we decide to pursue commercialization opportunities for our future products ourselves  or if we co promote and or retain a significant role in the commercialization of our future products with strategic partners  we may make significant expenditures to secure commercial resources to sell such products and expand our marketing capabilities to support such growth 
if our projected expenses increase for our product candidates currently in development  or if we expand our studies for additional indications for our pa product candidate or new product candidates  then  as a result of these or other factors  we may need to raise additional capital 
therefore  as part of our ongoing assessment of our business and liquidity needs  we regularly assess available funding options and will consider available funding opportunities as they arise

our forecast of the period of time through which we expect that our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our success  or any delays  in obtaining  regulatory approval of our product candidates and success in  and manner of  commercializing our products  the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to establish additional collaborations  costs incurred in pre commercialization activities for our products  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  technologies or products
