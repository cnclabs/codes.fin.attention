item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview aruba networks is the leading provider of next generation network access solutions for mobile enterprise networks 
the move architecture unifies wired and wireless infrastructures into one seamless network access solution for traveling business professionals  remote workers  corporate headquarters employees and guests 
with the aruba move architecture  access privileges are linked to a user s identity 
that means an enterprise workforce has consistent  secure access to network resources based on who they are no matter where they are  what devices they are using or how they are connected 
it s a unique approach that s driven by mobility and the proliferation of wi fi enabled mobile devices 
these devices which have no ethernet port are connecting to enterprise networks in unprecedented numbers and will quickly surpass desktop connections 
aruba meets this challenge by eliminating the cost and complexity of managing separate wired and wireless access policies 
in fact  with aruba  our customers need fewer ports and consequently less equipment in the wiring closet effectively rightsizing our customers access infrastructure 
aruba s move architecture provides context aware networking for the post pc era 
mobility network services are delivered centrally from the data center across thin network access devices or on ramps 
at the heart of aruba move  a single set of mobility network services manages security  policy and network performance for every user and device on the network  regardless of location or how they connect 
this mobility and user centric approach makes it possible to re architect the access network to simultaneously provide workforce mobility and reduce costs 
to connect users into the network  whether at work  home  or on the road  aruba access on ramps include wireless  wired  and vpn products 
device configuration  security policies  and reporting are all done centrally in the data center effectively making installation a zero touch experience 
a key new addition to our move architecture is our clearpass access management system 
ideal for byod provisioning and onboarding  clearpass makes it easy for it issued and personal mobile devices to securely connect to any network 
by centralizing access policies across the entire network  clearpass automates differentiated user and device access  policy management and the provisioning of devices for secure network access and posture assessment 
this ensures that each user has the right access privileges based on who they are and what device they are using 
clearpass is essential when increasing numbers of consumer devices windows  mac os x  ios  android and linux connect to the network and access is required by a broader range of users employees  visitors  customers and contractors 
another key addition is aruba instant  a controller less wi fi solution that combines ease of use and cost effectiveness with best in class security  resiliency and intelligence 
in aruba instant mode  a single access point is dynamically elected the master  which automatically distributes the network configuration to other aruba instant aps in the wlan 
our customers simply power up one aruba instant ap  configure it over the air  and plug in the other access points 
the entire deployment process is substantially reduced  saving our customers time and operational expenses 
our products have been sold to over  customers worldwide  including some of the largest and most complex global organizations 
we have implemented a two tier distribution model in most areas of the world  including the united states  with value added distributors vads and original equipment manufacturers oem s selling our portfolio of products  including a variety of our support services  to a diverse number of value added resellers vars 
our focus continues to be management of our channel including selection and growth of high prospect partners  activation of our vars and vads through active training and field collaboration  and evolution of our channel programs in consultation with our partners 

table of contents major trends affecting our financial results worldwide economic conditions our business depends on the overall demand for it and on the economic health and general willingness of our current and prospective customers to make capital commitments 
if the conditions in the us  european and global economic environments remain uncertain or continue to be volatile  or if they deteriorate further  our business  operating results  and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
economic weakness  customer financial difficulties and constrained spending on it initiatives have resulted  and may in the future result  in challenging and delayed sales cycles and could negatively impact our ability to forecast future periods 
in particular  we cannot be assured of the level of it spending  the deterioration of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and growth rates 
revenue our ability to increase our product revenue will depend significantly on continued growth in the market for enterprise mobility and remote networking solutions  continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  our ability to continue to attract new customers  our ability to compete  the willingness of customers to displace wired networks with wireless lans  in particular  wireless lans that utilize our n solution  and our ability to continue to sell into our installed base of existing customers 
our growth in support revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will also be directly affected by the timing and size of orders  product and channel mix  average selling prices  costs of our products  our ability to effectively implement and generate incremental business from our two tier distribution model  general economic conditions  and the extent to which we invest in our sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative resources 
the revenue growth that we have experienced has been driven primarily by an expansion of our customer base coupled with increased purchases from existing customers 
we believe the growth we have experienced is the result of business enterprises needing to provide secure mobility to their users in a manner that we believe is more cost effective than the traditional approach of using port centric networks 
while our revenue growth rate slowed over the last fiscal year  we believe that our product offerings  in particular our products that incorporate clearpass  move and aruba instant technologies  will enable broader networking initiatives by both our current and potential customers in the future 
each quarter  our ability to meet our product revenue expectations is dependent upon new orders received  shipped  and recognized in a given quarter  the amount of orders booked but not shipped in the prior quarter that are shipped in the current quarter  and the amount of deferred revenue entering a given quarter 
our product deferred revenue is comprised of product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the agreement  typically with our large customers  contain acceptance terms and conditions or other terms that require that the revenue be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met  and product orders shipped to our vads and oems for which we have not yet received persuasive evidence from the vads or oems of a sale to an end customer 
we typically ship products within a reasonable time period after the receipt of an order 
costs and expenses operating expenses consist of research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation for all employees 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these categories 
as of july   we had  employees worldwide compared to  employees at july  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in fiscal going forward  we expect to continue to hire employees throughout the company 

table of contents significant events our financial results during the year ended july  were affected by certain significant events that should be considered in comparing the periods presented 
business combinations on november   we completed our acquisition of avenda systems avenda  a leading developer of network security solutions 
the purchase price was million  which is comprised of million of cash and million of common stock 
as part of the acquisition agreement  we agreed to incremental cash payments of up to approximately million to avenda s former employees who became our employees  which will be made over a period of up to two years from the closing date  subject to certain continued employment restrictions 
approximately million of the incremental payments were paid immediately after the acquisition date and were included in the purchase price allocation 
the remaining balance of approximately million was excluded from the purchase price allocation and will be recorded as compensation expense over the service period 
the acquisition resulted in additional goodwill of million 
on may   we acquired a wireless technology company 
the total purchase price was approximately million in cash  million of which was placed in escrow to secure our indemnification rights under the purchase agreement 
the acquisition resulted in additional goodwill of million 
in addition  we agreed to an incremental cash payment and stock awards totaling approximately million  subject to certain vesting conditions and continued employment restrictions 
the incremental cash payment and stock awards will be recorded as compensation expense over the service period 
stock repurchase on june   we announced a stock repurchase program for up to million worth of our common stock 
we are authorized to make repurchases in the open market until june   and any such repurchases will be funded from available working capital 
the number of share repurchases and the timing of repurchases are based on the price of our common stock  general business and market conditions  and other investment considerations shares are retired upon repurchase 
our policy related to repurchases of our common stock is to charge any excess of cost over par value entirely to additional paid in capital 
as of july   we repurchased a total of  shares for a total purchase price of million  with million remaining authorized under the stock repurchase program 
revenue  cost of revenue and operating expenses revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our arubaos operating system  controllers  wired and wireless access points  switches  application software modules  multi vendor management solution software  and professional services and support 
professional services revenue consists of consulting and training services 
consulting services primarily consist of installation support services 
training services are instructor led courses on the use of our products 
support services typically consist of software updates  on a when and if available basis  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
we provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through vads  vars  and oems 
we expect revenue from indirect channels to continue to constitute a significant majority of our future revenue 
we sell our products to channel partners and end customers located in the americas  europe  the middle east  africa and asia pacific 
we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets  and we expect international revenue to increase in absolute dollars and remain consistent or increase as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal for more information about our international revenue  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue consists primarily of manufacturing costs for our products  shipping and logistics costs  and expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations 
we utilize third parties to manufacture our products and perform shipping logistics 
we have outsourced the substantial majority of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations 
accordingly  the substantial majority of our cost of revenue consists of payments to our contract manufacturers 
our contractor manufacturers produce our products in china and singapore using quality assurance programs and standards that we jointly established 
manufacturing  engineering and documentation controls are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california  bangalore  india and beijing  china 
cost of product revenue also includes amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 

table of contents cost of professional services and support revenue is primarily comprised of personnel costs  including stock based compensation  of providing technical support  including personnel costs associated with our internal support organization 
in addition  we engage a third party support vendor to complement our internal support resources  the costs of which are included within costs of professional services and support revenue 
gross margin our gross margin has been  and will continue to be  affected by a variety of factors  including the proportion of our products that are sold through direct versus indirect channels  product mix and average selling prices  new product introductions  such as our move architecture  our clearpass solutions  and product enhancements made by us as well as those made by our competitors  pressure to discount our products in response to our competitor s discounting practices  mix of revenue attributed to our international regions  demand for our products and services  our ability to attain volume manufacturing pricing from our contract manufacturers and our component suppliers  losses associated with excess and obsolete inventory  growth in our headcount and other related costs incurred in our customer support organization  costs associated with manufacturing overhead  our ability to manage freight costs  and amortization expense from our purchased intangible assets 
due to higher net effective discounts for products sold through our indirect channel  our overall gross margin for indirect channel sales are typically lower than those associated with direct sales 
we expect product revenue from our indirect channel to continue to constitute a significant majority of our total revenue  which  by itself  negatively impacts our gross margin 
further  we expect that within our indirect channel  sales through our vads and oems will continue to be significant  which will negatively impact our gross margin as vads and oems generally experience a larger net effective discount than our other channel partners 
research and development expenses research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and facilities costs 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe it is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
for fiscal  we expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and primarily consist of personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
amortization expense related to our purchased intangible assets is also included in sales and marketing expenses 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest strategically in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base  expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  build brand awareness and sponsor additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive  and thus  the increase in sales and marketing expenses that we experience as we hire additional sales personnel is not expected to immediately result in increased revenue 
as a result  these expenses will reduce our operating margin until such sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance 
for fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 
table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facilities costs related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  as well as insurance  investor relations  and it infrastructure costs related to our enterprise resource planning erp system 
further  our general and administrative expenses include professional services consisting of outside legal  audit  sarbanes oxley and it consulting costs 
we have incurred in the past  and may continue to incur  significant legal costs defending ourselves against claims made by third parties 
these expenses are expected to continue as part of our ongoing operations and depending on the timing and outcome of lawsuits and the legal process  could have a significant impact on our financial statements 
for fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain constant or increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal  however fluctuations in professional services can cause an increase in any particular quarter 
other income expense  net other income expense  net includes interest income on cash balances  accretion of discount or amortization of premium on short term investments  losses or gains on foreign exchange rate changes  and in connection with our acquisition of azalea in september  changes in the fair value of our contingent rights liability 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  share based compensation  inventory valuation  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition total revenue is derived primarily from the sale of products and services  including professional services and support 
the following revenue recognition policies define the manner in which we account for our sales transactions 
we recognized revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred or the title and risk of loss has passed  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the customer has accepted  or once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differs from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments are received  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction to revenue upon shipment based on its contractual obligations and historical returns experience 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that will likely result in a specific customer s request to return purchased equipment  we record a specific sales returns reserve 

table of contents effective beginning of fiscal  we adopted accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
our current revenue recognition policies  which were applied in fiscal and fiscal  provide that  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as hardware and software products  licenses and or services  we allocate revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if available  third party evidence tpe of selling price  if vsoe is not available  or best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
in multiple element arrangements where non essential software deliverables are included  revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverable and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the applicable accounting guidance 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we establish vsoe of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices when sold separately 
vsoe for support services is measured by the stand alone renewal rate offered to the customer 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for an element falls within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
tpe of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
we typically are not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish the selling price of our non software elements using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we regularly review estimated selling price of the product offerings and maintains internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
there was not a material impact to revenue recognized during the third quarter or first nine months of fiscal  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the near term from changes in estimated selling prices  including vsoe of selling price 
for fiscal  pursuant to the previous guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables prior to the adoption of asu  for a sales arrangement with multiple elements  we allocated revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  for software  based on vsoe of fair value 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we first allocated revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
where the fair value for an undelivered element could not be determined  we deferred revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements were delivered or the fair value was determinable for the remaining undelivered elements 
if the revenue for a delivered item was not recognized because it was not separable from the undelivered item  then we also deferred the cost of the delivered item 
we limited the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that was not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
products product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances and perpetual software licenses 
the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software elements and are not subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
for these appliances  delivery occurs upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to ensure an end user has been identified by the channel partner prior to shipment to a channel partner 
for end users and channel partners  we generally had no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
for sales to direct end users and certain channel partners  including value added resellers vars  and original equipment manufacturers oems  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we also sell through value added distributors vads 
a significant portion of our sales are made through vads under agreements allowing for stocking of our products in their inventory  pricing credits and limited rights of return for stock rotation 
product revenue on sales made through these vads is initially deferred and revenue is recognized upon sell through as reported by the vads to us 
the amount of inventory held by vads pending a sale to an end customer was million and million as of july  and 
table of contents our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software products may operate on our hardware appliance but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
sales of stand alone software generally include a perpetual license to our software 
for sales of stand alone software  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when only the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
services service revenue consists of revenue from support agreements  professional services  and training 
support services include repair and replacement of defective hardware appliances  software updates and access to technical support personnel 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one to five years 
revenue for professional services is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within days from the start of service 
revenue for training services is recognized upon delivery of the training 
costs associated with these service offerings are expensed as incurred 
post contractual services pcs that we provide to our channel partners differ from pcs that we provide to our end customers in that we are only obligated to provide support services to the channel partner directly  while the channel partner is obligated to provide support services directly to the end customer 
the channel partner is obligated to provide to the end customer first level troubleshooting assistance as well as second level support for high level technical and product diagnosis which might include returned merchandise fulfillment 
our obligations are only to provide software upgrades and  in the unusual scenario in which the channel partner is unable to provide the technical support that the end customer requires  a third level technical diagnosis and support 
ratable product and related professional services and support certain revenue arrangements prior to the second quarter of fiscal and those acquired through business combinations where we were not able to establish vsoe on prior services and support offerings are recognized ratably over the support period 
shipping and handling shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employees under the fair value method 
our share based payment awards include stock options  restricted stock units and awards  employee stock purchase plan awards and performance based awards 
we calculate the fair value of restricted stock based on the fair market value on the date of grant 
we calculate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plans on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing method 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
we determine the amount of stock based compensation expense based on awards that we ultimately expect to vest  reduced for estimated forfeitures 
in addition  compensation expense includes the effects of awards modified  repurchased or cancelled 

table of contents inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using the standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record inventory write downs for potentially excess inventory based on forecasted demand  economic trends  technological obsolescence of our products and transition of inventory related to new product releases 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs could be required and would be reflected in cost of product revenue in the period the revision is made 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
inventory write downs amounted to million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and a detailed assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  our management considers  among other factors  the aging of the accounts receivable  including trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  our historical write offs  the credit worthiness of each customer  the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and general economic conditions  especially given the recent financial crisis in today s economic environment 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet their financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due from the customer  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at july  and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of impairment testing  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our company 
these estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily includes our market capitalization 
as of the date of the assessment  our market capitalization was substantially in excess of our carrying value 
as a result  we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from one to seven years 
amortization expense is recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to estimated results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
determination of recoverability of purchased intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operating expenses will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  along with net operating loss carryforwards  if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences  research and credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards are deductible 
to the extent deferred tax assets cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance is established 
as a result of our increasing profitability in fiscal  expectations for continued profits going forward  and expected material taxable income generated from intercompany payments resulting from our offshore tax restructuring implemented during fiscal year  we determined that it is more likely than not that future profitability will be sufficient to realize deferred income tax assets 
in accordance with asc and related literature  we released a majority of our valuation allowances against our deferred income tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal we continue to maintain million valuation allowance against a portion of our foreign net operating loss deferred tax assets 
net income for fiscal includes a discrete tax benefit of million which was largely attributed to the release of our valuation allowances and the recording of the associated net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
we continue to believe it is more likely than not that future profitability will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
income tax contingencies are accounted for and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
as of july  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  which if recognized would affect our income tax expense

product revenue increased during fiscal compared to fiscal the rapid proliferation of wi fi enabled mobile devices  the adoption of byod policies by various enterprises  the increase in demand for multimedia rich mobility applications are driving the increase in demand for our products 
our move architecture continues to gain momentum as companies move toward a new architecture in which wireless becomes the primary access network  resulting in significant growth in the sales of our access point products  and an increase in both hardware and software product sales 
professional services and support revenue increased during fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily a result of both increased product and first year support sales  and the renewal of support contracts by existing customers as our customer base continues to grow 

table of contents ratable product and related professional services and support revenue are composed of certain revenue arrangements entered prior to the second quarter of fiscal  and certain legacy azalea transactions shipped prior to the acquisition  where we were not able to establish vsoe on prior services and support offerings and had to recognize revenue ratably over the support period 
the increase in ratable product and related professional services and support revenue from fiscal to fiscal is due to recognition of revenue from certain legacy azalea transactions where revenue recognition criteria became satisfied during fiscal we expect this revenue stream to continue to be a small portion of total revenue in future periods  revenue from our indirect sales channel increased during fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue 
going forward  we expect to continue to derive a significant majority of our total revenue from indirect channels as we continue to focus on improving the efficiency of marketing and selling our products through these channels 
revenue from shipments to locations outside the united states increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due to strong demand across all of our geographies 
our international revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  the us revenue was slightly down during fiscal compared to we expect to continue to increase our market penetration and extend our geographic reach through our network of channel partners 
during fiscal  total revenue increased million  or  over fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to broad based demand across all of our major geographies and verticals  and the significant growth in our customer base 
our network rightsizing and move architecture initiatives continued to gain momentum as companies move toward a new access network 
the rapid proliferation of wi fi enabled mobile devices  the increase in demand for multimedia rich mobility applications  and the rise of both server and desktop virtualization is driving this trend 
cost of revenue and gross margin years ended july  in thousands total revenue cost of product cost of professional services and support cost of ratable product and related professional services and support total cost of revenue gross profit gross margin during fiscal total cost of revenue increased compared to fiscal primarily due to the corresponding increase in our product revenue

provision for income taxes as of july   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
we also had research and credit carryforwards of million for federal and million for state income tax purposes as of july  
table of contents if not utilized  the federal and state net operating loss and federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire between and utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we have experienced an ownership change in the past  or if an ownership change occurs in the future 
we continuously monitor the circumstances impacting the expected realization of our deferred tax assets 
as of july   based on available positive evidence  we determined that the majority of our deferred tax assets would be more likely than not realizable in the near future  with the exception of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards as we cannot forecast sufficient future foreign income to realize these deferred tax assets before they expire 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because we expect our us operations will have sufficient cash for current and future business activities 
therefore  it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest such undistributed earnings outside the us in the respective foreign entities 
we recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained 
we recorded a net increase of million to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in the current period and a net decrease of million to the liability for positions taken in the prior periods

in the three months ended april   we recorded adjustments to reduce tax expense of million and recorded additional stock based compensation expense of million  related to the fiscal quarters ended october  and january   respectively 
the impact of the adjustments made in fiscal quarters ended july  and april  would have resulted in a decrease in net loss of million for the years ended july  and  and a decrease in the net loss of million for the year ended july  on a quarterly basis for fiscal  the impact would be to decrease the net loss by million  million and million in the three months ended october   january  and july   respectively  and to increase net income by million for the three months ended april  we have assessed the impact of these adjustments on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of comprehensive income as of and for the periods ended july    and  and we have concluded that the adjustments are not material  either individually  or in the aggregate  to the previously reported financial statements

liquidity and capital resources july  july  in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments years ended july  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents as of july   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash  sweep funds and money market funds with an original maturity of days or less at the time of purchase 
short term investments include corporate bonds  us government agency securities  us treasury bills  commercial paper  and certificates of deposit 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million during fiscal from million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of july  to million as of july  as of july   we had million of cash and cash equivalents held outside the united states 
historically  we have required capital principally to fund our working capital needs and acquisition activities 
it is our investment policy to invest excess cash in a manner that preserves capital  provides liquidity and maintains appropriate diversification and optimizes current income within our policy s framework 
we are averse to principal loss and will ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
our investment policy is designed to prevent fluctuations in market value which materially affect our financial results 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by our profitability  working capital requirements  the extent to which we increase spending on personnel and the continued growth in revenue and cash collections 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and cash flows from sales personnel 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  purchases of inventory  and rent payments 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and a decrease of million from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
during fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and a decrease of million from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal we purchased more short term investments during fiscal compared to fiscal as we reinvested cash flow from operations 
purchases of property and equipment in fiscal increased million compared to fiscal due to an increase in headcount 
further  we completed two acquisitions during fiscal for a total of million of cash used  net of cash received 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash used in investing activities during fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal we continued to invest our excess cash balances in short term investments 
some of the proceeds from the sale and maturity of these investments were used to purchase million of property and equipment during fiscal further  we completed two acquisitions during fiscal for a total of million in cash  net of cash received 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from financing activities cash provided by financing activities was essentially flat in fiscal compared to fiscal and primarily consisted of the cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity plans 
in addition  during fiscal  we started receiving tax benefits associated with stock based compensation of million 
this tax benefit was slightly offset by million of cash used to repurchase our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities increased million during fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in cash proceeds we received from the issuance of common stock in conjunction with our equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan 
the increase was primarily driven by increased exercises of stock options by our employees as a result of the increase in the fair market value of our common stock and an increase in the amount of contributions in our employee stock purchase plan 
based on our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments we expect that we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations for the next months 
however  we may  in the future  need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations or support acquisition activity 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of our products and potential future business acquisitions 

table of contents contractual obligations commitments operating leases purchase obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations represent contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and exclude contractual amounts that are cancelable without penalty 
these contractual amounts are related principally to inventory  information technology and marketing related purchase agreements 
we outsource the production of our hardware to various third party manufacturing suppliers  one of which is our main contract manufacturer 
under the agreement with our main contract manufacturer  of the order quantities can be rescheduled or are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date  and of the order quantities can be rescheduled or are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 

table of contents uncertain tax positions as of july   our unrecognized tax benefits were million which were mostly reflected as a reduction to deferred tax assets 
as such  there are no material amounts of contractual obligations associated with these unrecognized benefits to be included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and therefore  our revenue is not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  indian rupee  and chinese yuan 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts because expenses in foreign currencies have been insignificant  and exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million and at july  and  respectively 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
if overall interest rates had fallen by during fiscal  our interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments would have declined approximately million assuming consistent investment levels
