our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to successfully develop new technologies and products  and complemented by our ability to implement our selective acquisitions strategy 
new technologies or products that we may develop may not lead to an incremental increase in revenues  and there is a risk that these new technologies or products will decrease the demand for our existing products and result in an offsetting reduction in revenues 
there can be no assurance that the benefits of any acquisition will outweigh the attendant costs  and if they do not  our results of operations and stock price may be adversely affected 
net sales increased million or between and to billion in from million in net sales increased million or between and to million in from million in sales in each end market were favorably impacted in each year by contributions from products we added from recent acquisitions 
for and  we estimate that between to and to  respectively  of net sales were derived from acquisitions concluded in each fiscal year 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
our analysis of sales by end markets may be found in the results of operations section below 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for the last three fiscal years is approximately as follows amounts in thousands communications defense security aerospace industrial total operating income increased million to million in from million in the favorable impact of higher sales of million and higher gross margin of million were offset by increases in selling  general and administrative costs of million  research and development costs of million and amortization expense of million  offset by million lower restructuring costs 
while each of our acquisitions contributed to higher sales and operating income  we immediately executed an integration plan in functional areas such as sales  operations  human resources  finance and information technology 
we have actively taken steps to integrate the management of our various operations  including management of our recent acquisitions 
sales offices  personnel and efforts are combined 
production has been transferred among our facilities to share resources and technology  as well as to increase efficiency 
we strive to make the best possible use of our engineering capabilities by sharing product road maps  research and production methods across our divisions and  where appropriate  assigning engineers to the same projects  regardless of which facility records personnel expense 
due to this commingling of activities  we do not practically measure the impact of any particular acquisition 
our acquisitions subjected us to certain risks see part ii  item ia  risk factors  we may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations 
uncertain macroeconomic conditions worldwide subject us to certain risks see part ii  item a  risk factors  negative or uncertain worldwide economic conditions may adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations  the concentration of the facilities that service the semiconductor industry  including facilities of current or potential vendors or customers  makes us more susceptible to events or disasters affecting the areas in which they are most concentrated  and we may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations 
in response to the impact of flooding at subcontractor 
table of contents facilities in thailand  we implemented plans that moved production to other facilities outside the affected area 
we believe that current production capabilities at these other facilities can compensate in the near future for the loss of production in the flooded facilities in thailand and that we have recovered from this event as of the end of the second quarter of however  unforeseen impacts on our customers  suppliers or subcontractors as a result of the flooding in thailand could continue to affect our revenue  consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
concentrations of credit risk exist because we rely on a significant portion of customers whose principal sales are to the us government 
approximately of total net sales in were in the defense security end market  with a very significant amount to customers whose principal sales are to the us government or to subcontractors whose material sales are to the us government 
we are subject to the impacts of potential sequestration under the budget control act of and other risks related to us government sales see part ii  item a  risk factors  reliance on government contracts for a portion of our sales could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
we closed our scottsdale facility during the second quarter of we may make further specific determinations to consolidate  close  sell or divest additional facilities  operations or product lines  which could be announced at any time 
possible adverse consequences from current and future consolidation or disposition activities may include a loss of revenues and various accounting charges such as for workforce reduction  including severance and other termination benefits and for excess facilities  including lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from facilities 
we may also be adversely impacted from inventory buildup in preparation for the transition of manufacturing  disposition costs  impairments of goodwill  a possible immediate loss of revenues  and other items in addition to normal or attendant risks and uncertainties 
we may be unsuccessful in any of our current or future efforts to consolidate our business into a smaller number of facilities 
our plans to minimize or eliminate any loss of revenues during consolidation may not be achieved

table of contents acquisitions zarlink semiconductor  inc during october  we completed our acquisition of zarlink semiconductor  inc zarlink through a wholly owned subsidiary 
following the expiration of the previously announced offers for all of the issued and outstanding common shares zarlink shares and unsecured  subordinated convertible debentures maturing september  zarlink debentures and together with the zarlink shares  the zarlink securities of zarlink  we acquired all remaining zarlink shares and zarlink debentures for million in cash through compulsory acquisitions under  respectively  the canada business corporations act and the trust indenture governing the zarlink debentures 
we acquired zarlink for its world leading  mixed signal chip technologies for a broad range of communication and medical applications 
zarlink s core capabilities include timing solutions that manage time sensitive communication applications over wireless and wired networks  line circuits supporting high quality voice services over cable and broadband connections  and ultra low power radios enabling new wireless medical devices and therapies 
serving the world s largest original equipment manufacturers  zarlink s highly integrated chip solutions help customers simplify design  lower costs and reach market quickly 
we sometimes refer to this division herein as microsemi cmpg 
we allocated the total consideration to zarlink s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the transaction 
during the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our allocation of deferred tax assets  net 
the consideration is allocated as follows in thousands cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories other current assets property and equipment deferred tax assets  net other assets identifiable intangible assets goodwill current liabilities other non current liabilities total consideration identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives are as follows amounts in thousands asset amount weighted average useful life years completed technology customer relationships backlog trade name timing  synchronization and synthesis business of maxim integrated products  inc during january  we acquired the timing  synchronization and synthesis business of maxim integrated products  inc for million in cash 
the acquired product lines and technology are vital to the effective and efficient delivery of time sensitive voice  data and multimedia traffic over wireless and wired networks  and will further provide our customers with the critical synchronization components required to harmonize system and network clocks  as well as the synthesis products required to distribute timing clocks throughout each system 

table of contents we allocated the total consideration to the acquired business tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the date of the completion of the transaction 
the consideration is allocated as follows in thousands inventories property and equipment identifiable intangible assets goodwill current liabilities total consideration identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives are as follows amounts in thousands asset amount weighted average useful life years completed technology customer relationships backlog valuation methodology the fair value of the identified intangible assets for the acquisitions noted above was estimated by performing a discounted cash flow analysis using the income approach 
this method includes a forecast of direct revenues and costs associated with the respective intangible assets and charges for economic returns on tangible and intangible assets utilized in cash flow generation 
net cash flows attributable to the identified intangible assets were discounted to their present value at a rate commensurate with the perceived risk 
the projected cash flow assumptions considered contractual relationships  customer attrition  eventual development of new technologies and market competition 
the valuation of completed technology and trade names for the acquisitions noted above was based on the relief from royalty income approach  a variation of the income approach 
the premise of the relief from royalty income approach is that if we had not been assigned the rights to the technology and trade names  we would have to pay royalties to continue to exploit the technology and trade names covered by their claims 
to arrive at an estimate of royalty charges  the acquired entity s revenue and profit margins were analyzed to determine the ability to pay a royalty 
in addition  the license databases were searched for actual royalty terms based on transactions involving technology and trade name licensing 
the useful lives of completed technology rights are based on the number of years in which net cash flows have been projected 
the useful life of backlog is estimated based upon the fulfillment period 
the useful lives of customer relationships are estimated based upon the length of the relationships currently in place  historical attrition patterns and natural growth and diversification of other potential customers 
the useful life of a trade name was estimated based on the period in which a benefit could be ascribed to the identified trade names 
assumptions used in forecasting cash flows for each of the identified intangible assets included consideration of the following historical performance including sales and profitability 
business prospects and industry expectations 
estimated economic life of asset 
development of new technologies 
acquisition of new customers 
attrition of existing customers 
obsolescence of technology over time 

table of contents generally  the allocation of purchase prices results in an allocation to goodwill 
depending on the structure of a particular acquisition  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets may not be deductible for tax purposes 
we determined that goodwill related to the zarlink acquisition is not deductible while goodwill related to the acquisition of the timing  synchronization and synthesis business of maxim integrated products  inc is deductible 
the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include the premium paid over market capitalization immediately prior to the merger announcement 
our belief that the merger will create a more diverse semiconductor company with expansive offerings which will enable us to expand our product offerings 
our belief that both companies are committed to improving cost structures and that our combined efforts after the merger should result in a realization of cost savings and an improvement of overall efficiencies 
the purchase price allocations described above are preliminary  primarily with respect to tax contingency matters 
a final determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed relating to the transactions could differ from the preliminary purchase price allocations and if material differences exist they could result in retrospective revision to the purchase price allocations 
we utilized the straight line method of amortization for completed technology  customer relationships and trade name and the estimated fulfillment period for backlog 
restructuring and severance charges in  we approved consolidation plans that resulted in the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona scottsdale  which ceased production during the quarter ended april  the scottsdale facility occupied a  square foot leased facility 
employee severance is expected to be paid through facility termination costs relate primarily to remaining obligations under facility and equipment leases and are expected to be paid through the following table reflects the restructuring activities for the scottsdale facility and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance facility termination costs total balance at october  cash expenditures balance at september  at october   we had recorded severance accruals of million from reductions in force at our various facilities other than scottsdale 
we recorded additional provisions  primarily related to activities at microsemi cmpg  for severance and retention payments totaling million in and also assumed a fair value of million in pre acquisition liabilities recorded by microsemi cmpg 
severance covered approximately individuals in manufacturing  engineering and sales 
employee severance is expected to be paid within the next twelve months 
contract termination costs relate primarily to remaining obligations under facility leases and are expected to be paid through during the quarter ended july   we executed an agreement with a landlord that released us from a lease commitment and as a result  we reversed million in provision for contract termination costs 
other associated costs related primarily to relocation costs that we incurred for the consolidation of several facilities in northern california 
the following table reflects the related restructuring activities and the accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at the dates below amounts in thousands employee severance contract termination costs other associated costs total balance at october  assumed from acquisition provisions reversal of prior provision cash expenditures other non cash settlement balance at september  
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies that we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained in note to these consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amount shown in the balance sheet are trade accounts receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based in part on our historical write off experience and specific review of account balances due 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we determine that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
to date  our allowance for doubtful accounts has generally been within management s estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
additionally  inventory write downs are made based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
the net realizable value of our inventories for ongoing operations has generally been within management s estimates 
we have recorded inventory write downs for discontinued product lines that did not meet gross margin targets  products that are being migrated to newer generations  products that service the large capital spending end markets for which demand has declined  products related to facility closures and losses related to flooding of a facility in thailand 
fair value of financial assets and liabilities accounting standards codification asc permits entities to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets and financial liabilities 
for financial assets or financial liabilities for which an entity elects the fair value option  asc requires that the entity record the financial asset or financial liability at fair value rather than at historical cost with changes in fair value recorded in the income statement 
asc requires that upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
as further discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we elected the fair value option in accounting for the term loan balance outstanding as of october  following the extinguishment of the term loan in conjunction with our acquisition of zarlink  we did not elect the fair value option and are reporting new term loan balances subsequent to october   at par value 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition including manufacturing plant closures 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable and the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group are less than the carrying value  an impairment 
table of contents loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets within the asset group over their fair value is recorded 
the appropriate asset group is determined based on the lowest level of largely independent cash inflows and outflows for the related assets 
depending on the nature of the primary assets in the asset group  fair value is estimated using one of several approaches including replacement cost  appraised values  market quotes or estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk involved 
during  we recorded a held for sale impairment of million related to the real estate and building for our closed manufacturing facility in broomfield  colorado and a held and used impairment of million for the closure of our manufacturing facility in scottsdale  arizona to reflect our long lived assets at their lower fair value 
future impairments may be required if we close other manufacturing sites 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill on an impairment only approach and amortize intangible assets with definite useful lives over the benefit period  which approximates straight line expense over the respective useful lives 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset such as goodwill is impaired as the basis for determining whether a quantitative impairment test is required 
we assess definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings 
we operate as one reporting unit and an impairment charge would equal the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in our one reporting unit over its then fair value 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
we completed our most recent quantitative analysis during the fourth quarter of and noted that the estimated fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and no qualitative factors existed during the fiscal year to indicate that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we primarily recognize revenue from customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors  and these contracts may permit limited stock rotation returns 
we provide an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenue have been within management s expectations 
we also derive a portion of our revenue from fixed price contracts 
revenue for these contracts are recorded under a percentage of completion method  which is based on the ratio of total costs incurred to date to estimated total costs at completion 
gross profit expected to be realized on fixed price contracts are based on periodic estimates of total revenues and costs for each contract 
losses on contracts are accrued when estimated total costs exceed total revenues 
occasionally  we will enter into contracts on a cost plus fee basis 
we recognize revenue based on reimbursements for actual expenses plus the contractually agreed upon fee with the customer 
restructuring charges we recognize a liability for restructuring costs when the liability is incurred 
the restructuring accruals are based upon management estimates at the time they are recorded and can change depending upon changes in facts and circumstances subsequent to the date the original liability is recorded 
the main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions and elimination of excess facilities 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability exists  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their expected termination dates and expected severance payments or when formal severance plans exist  when the severance payments are probable and reasonably estimable 
the elimination of excess facilities results in charges for lease termination fees  future contractual commitments to pay lease charges net of estimated sublease income  facility remediation costs and moving costs to remove property and equipment from the facilities 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises or ceased use of the facility 
stock based compensation compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights was calculated based on the grant or assumption date using the black scholes pricing model 
all stock appreciation rights we have granted or assumed are stock settled 
stock options and stock appreciation rights are granted at exercise prices equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 

table of contents assumed stock options and stock appreciation rights are granted at exercise prices determined in accordance with the acquisition agreement 
expected life was estimated based on historical exercise data that was stratified between members of the board of directors  executive employees and all other recipients 
expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility using equally weighted daily price observations over a period approximately equal to the expected life of each option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury securities with an equivalent remaining term 
no dividends are expected to be paid 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards was calculated based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
restricted stock awards are subject to forfeiture if a participant does not meet length of service requirements 
performance stock units are subject to performance based vesting requirements and generally vest based on the company s growth in net sales and earnings per share subject to certain adjustments for fiscal years and in comparison with the growth in net sales and adjusted earnings per share over the same period for a peer group selected by the compensation committee 
compensation expense is based upon our estimate of performance relative to the peer group 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the need to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based upon the amount of existing temporary differences  the period in which they are expected to be recovered and expected levels of taxable income 
a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize uncertain tax positions when they meet a more likely than not threshold 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense 
we file us federal  state  and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations 
fiscal years to generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
in significant foreign jurisdictions  the to tax years generally remain subject to examination by tax authorities 
we establish liabilities for possible assessments by tax authorities resulting from known tax exposures including  but not limited to  international tax issues and certain tax credits 
we are currently undergoing an internal revenue service examination as well as certain state examinations 
there have been no significant proposed adjustments to date 
we do not believe the results of any audits would have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
segment information we use the management approach for segment disclosure  which designates the internal organization that is used by management for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments 
we manage our business on the basis of one reportable segment  as a manufacturer of semiconductors in different geographic areas  including the united states  europe and asia 
results of operations net sales increased million or between and to billion for from million for net sales increased million or between and to million for from million for sales in each end market were favorably impacted in each year by contributions from products we added from recent acquisitions 
for and  we estimate that between to and to  respectively  of net sales were derived from acquisitions concluded in each fiscal year 
estimated sales by end markets are based on our understanding of end market uses of our products 
we believe an estimated breakout of net sales by end markets for the last three fiscal years is approximately as follows amounts in thousands communications defense security aerospace industrial total net sales in the communications end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
the increase in net sales during was due primarily to the contributions of voice circuit and timing and synchronization products of microsemi cmpg while net sales in 
table of contents benefited from our acquisition of microsemi soc 
over this period  market adoption of poe technology  especially by enterprise customers  has increased our market share and our wireless lan products are well accepted 
both and net sales also benefited from steady sales increases in our power management and conversion solutions 
we also serve the optical transport network  carrier ethernet switch  ip edge router and wireless backhaul markets which we consider growth markets 
our communications end markets are however sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and capital expenditure deployment and we expect net sales in this end market to decline in the upcoming quarter based on current and expected backlog 
net sales in the defense security end market decreased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
sales were adversely impacted by the lack of a federal budget through the first quarter of and uncertainty surrounding the defense budget has been reflected in cautious procurement plans of our customers 
we believe the most recent budget emphasizes command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance and equates to growing electronic content 
this is reflected in sequential growth in net sales since our second quarter of in  sales in this end market were favorably impacted by contributions from the ramping of millimeter wave scan subsystems used in whole body scanners  missile defense and military rf applications 
we also believe that both and  net sales benefited from increasing international defense sales  enabled in part by our security product offerings  and that microsemi s dollar content in defense programs will increase as our products move up the value chain 
we believe the department of defense and homeland security budgets for electronic content  an area of microsemi focus  will continue to expand and contribute to growth in this end market 
however  we recognize that the current uncertainty surrounding the us federal budget situation may result in short term delays in defense programs and potentially moderate growth in the upcoming quarter 
net sales in the aerospace end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
during and  we noted an increase in demand and order rates for commercial aircraft at aircraft manufacturers and tier one suppliers  growing electronic content in current aircraft  refurbishment programs for older aircraft and demand for the high reliability radar and avionics solutions we provide 
this growth followed a period where this end market was negatively impacted by global economic conditions 
growth in was offset by a slowdown in satellite billings in the beginning of the year though we have experienced increases in recent satellite order activity  which we believe is a reflection of our product portfolio  especially in system level products  power management  and programmable logic ics 
generally space related applications are in a less economically sensitive market  but due to higher average selling prices and our significant dollar content in satellite applications  this end market can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on the timing of shipments 
net sales in the industrial end market increased million to million in from million in and increased million between and from million 
the increase in was due primarily to the contributions of medical products of microsemi cmpg  though we noted growth in plasma cutting and welding applications where our high power proficiency differentiates our products 
we also noted steady contributions from our products for industrial printing  rail transport and precision gps products for surveying 
the increases in were driven by contributions from microsemi soc and growth in products for semiconductor capital equipment  an area which experienced substantial declines in and part of due to decreased capital spending during the recent economic downturn 
while we have lessened our reliance on semiconductor capital equipment applications  we expect cyclicality for products in this end market  as well as overall economic uncertainty to adversely impact this end market in the upcoming quarter 
an estimated breakout of net sales by originating geographic area for  and is approximately as follows amounts in thousands united states europe asia total gross profit increased million between and  to million of sales for from million of sales for and increased million between and  from million of sales for the increase in gross profit percentage for was primarily a result of contributions from the acquisition of microsemi cmpg 
during the second quarter of  gross profit was adversely affected by million from an inventory write off related to flooding in thailand  net of insurance recoveries 
gross profit percentage for was favorably impacted by higher margin products related to microsemi soc  cost optimization programs  transfer of manufacturing to lower cost and more efficient facilities including the closure of our scottsdale facility and reductions in personnel 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of bridging inventory that we intended to complete at other 
table of contents locations and million for the write off of medical inventory that did not meet our corporate gross margin targets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in credit risk  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates or the stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  which are related to credit risks  changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates and changes in certain interest rates 
we conduct a relatively small portion of our business in a number of foreign currencies  principally the european union euro  british pound  israeli shekel and chinese rmb 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
specific to the acquisition of zarlink  we entered into a foreign currency forward agreement in the fourth quarter of to minimize our foreign currency risk associated with the transaction that we funded in canadian dollars

concentrations of credit risk exists because we rely on a significant portion of customers whose principal sales are to the us government 
approximately of total net sales in were in the defense security end market  with a very significant amount to customers whose principal sales are to the us government or to subcontractors whose material sales are to the us government 
we  as a subcontractor  sell our products to higher tier subcontractors or to prime contractors based upon purchase orders that usually do not contain all of the conditions included in the prime contract with the us government 
however  these sales are usually subject to termination and or price renegotiations by virtue of their reference to a us government prime contract 
therefore  we believe that all of our product sales that ultimately are sold to the us government may be subject to termination  at the convenience of the us government or to price renegotiations under the renegotiation act 
we have never experienced a material loss due to termination of a u 
s government contract 
we have never had to renegotiate our price under any government contract 
we are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consisting principally of trade accounts receivable 
we attempt to limit our credit risk exposure by performing credit evaluations of our customers and monitoring the aging of invoices 
we have one customer that is a distributor of our products  primarily servicing our defense security and aerospace end markets  that accounted for approximately of net sales in  and any disruption with this distributor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  net sales from international markets represent a significant portion of total net sales 
our net sales to international customers represented approximately for  for and for these sales were principally to customers in europe and asia

table of contents in connection with the original credit agreement in  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of minimizing the variability of cash flows in the interest rate payments of our variable rate borrowings 
the cash flows received under the interest rate swap agreements are expected to offset the change in cash flows associated with libor rate borrowings between the effective and maturity dates of the swaps 
our three swap agreements have notional amounts  fixed rates and initial terms as follows million at for years  million at for years and million at for years 
we classify our interest rate swap balances as level fair value measurements
