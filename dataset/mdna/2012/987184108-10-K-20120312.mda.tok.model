all dollar amounts are stated in thousands of dollars 
overview the york water company the company is the oldest investor owned water utility in the united states  operated continuously since the company is a purely regulated water utility 
profitability is largely dependent on water revenues 
due to the size of the company and the limited geographic diversity of its service territory  weather conditions  particularly rainfall  economic  and market conditions can have an adverse affect on revenues 
was a challenging year in many respects 
market conditions and the economy in general are recovering very slowly from the recession 
as a result  there was very little growth in the customer base and existing customers reduced their water usage 
in  total water usage per customer declined by compared to much of the reduction is attributed to record rainfall  particularly during the third quarter which is normally a high usage period 
the company recorded more inches of rainfall in than in conservation efforts account for a lesser portion of the decline in consumption 
despite these challenges  the company was able to increase revenues in compared to due to a timely rate filing which settled in november the company also benefited from reduced income taxes in due to the deductibility of bonus depreciation for state tax purposes 
the tax savings helped to offset unexpected increases in expenses for tank remediation and bad debts 
the company s business does not require large amounts of working capital and is not dependent on any single customer or a very few customers for a material portion of its business 
in  operating revenue was derived from the following sources and in the following percentages residential   commercial and industrial   and other  which is primarily from the provision for fire service 
the customer mix helps to reduce volatility in consumption 
the company seeks to grow revenues by increasing the volume of water sold through increased consumption and increases in the number of customers served  and the timely filing for rate increases 
the company continuously looks for acquisition and expansion opportunities both within and outside its current service territory as well as through contractual services and bulk water supply 
in  the company entered into agreements with several municipalities to provide sewer billing services 
in addition  the company signed an agreement to purchase the assets and operate its first wastewater collection and treatment system 
the wastewater acquisition is subject to ppuc approval  but provides additional opportunities for the company to expand its business 
in  the company expects to pilot a service line protection program as well in order to further diversify the business 
performance measures company management uses financial measures including operating revenues  net income  earnings per share and return on equity to evaluate its financial performance 
additional statistical measures including number of customers  customer complaint rate  annual customer rates and the efficiency ratio are used to evaluate performance quality 
these measures are calculated on a regular basis and compared with historical information  budget and the other publicly traded water companies 
the company s performance was strong under the above measures 
increased rates from a rate filing and increases in the number of customers resulted in higher revenue 
in addition  the company incurred lower income taxes in the overall effect was an increase in net income in over of and a return on year end common equity of which was consistent with 
back to table of contents page the efficiency ratio  which is calculated as net income divided by revenues  is used by management to evaluate its ability to control expenses 
over the five previous years  the company s ratio averaged 
in  the ratio was higher than the average at due to the higher net income resulting from higher revenue and reduced income tax expense 
management is confident that its ratio will again exceed that of its peers 
management continues to look for ways to decrease expenses and increase efficiency as well as to file for rate increases promptly when needed 
results of operations compared with net income for was  an increase of  or  from net income of  for the primary contributing factors to the increase in net income were higher water revenues and lower income taxes which were partially offset by higher interest on debt and increased operating expenses  primarily for depreciation  pension  distribution system maintenance and the provision for doubtful accounts 
water operating revenues for the year increased  or  from  for to  for the primary reason for the increase in revenues was a rate increase effective november  the rate increase was partially offset by a lower volume of water sold

interest on debt for increased  or  from  for to  for the increase was primarily due to interest of on the senior notes  series a  issued in october of offsetting the increase were lower interest payments of on the company s lines of credit due to reduced borrowings  lower interest of due to retirement of the industrial development authority revenue refunding bonds  series  in june of and other lower interest expense of during  there were no borrowings under the lines of credit 
the average interest rate on the lines of credit was for on average debt outstanding of  interest expense in is expected to remain consistent with allowance for funds used during construction decreased  from for to in  due to a lower volume of eligible construction 
allowance for funds used during construction is expected to show a modest increase in based on a projected increase in the amount of construction expenditures 
other income expenses  net for reflects increased expenses of as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher employee retirement expense of approximately due to increased liabilities from a decline in the discount rate which was partially offset by life insurance proceeds 
also contributing to the increase were higher charitable contributions of approximately and increased other expenses aggregating approximately in  other income expenses will be largely determined by the change in market returns and discount rates

back to table of contents page acquisitions see note to the company s financial statements included herein for a discussion of its acquisitions 
on december   the company agreed to purchase the assets of asbury pointe wastewater collection and treatment system in york county  pennsylvania 
closing of the acquisition is contingent upon receiving approval from all required regulatory authorities 
closing is expected in the second quarter of at which time the company will add approximately wastewater customers 
this acquisition provides further diversification to the company s business by adding wastewater collection and treatment to its services 
on march   the company signed an agreement to purchase the assets of section a water corporation in adams county  pennsylvania  at a purchase price of the company will initially serve approximately new customers by operating the current system as a satellite location 
the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of following necessary approvals from regulatory authorities 
on march   the company signed an agreement to purchase the water assets of york starview  lp in york county  pennsylvania  at a purchase price of because york starview  lp is already in the company s service territory  fewer approvals will be needed 
the company expects to begin serving approximately new customers through an interconnection with its current distribution system during the second quarter of these acquisitions are expected to be immaterial to total company results 
the company is also pursuing other bulk water contracts and acquisitions in and around its service territory to help offset further declines in per capita water consumption 
capital expenditures during  the company invested  in construction expenditures including routine items  upgrades to its water treatment facilities  reinforcing water mains  and various replacements of aging infrastructure 
the company replaced and relined over  feet of main in the company was able to fund operating activities and construction expenditures using internally generated funds  proceeds from its stock purchase plans see note to the company s financial statements included herein  and customer advances 
the company anticipates construction and acquisition expenditures for and of approximately  and  respectively 
in addition to routine transmission and distribution projects  a portion of the anticipated and expenditures will be for additional main extensions  further upgrades to water treatment facilities  a new pumping station  improvements to the dams  an upgrade to the enterprise software system  and various replacements of aging infrastructure 
the company intends to use internally generated funds for at least half of its anticipated and construction and fund the remainder through line of credit borrowings  proceeds from its stock purchase plans  potential debt and equity offerings  the dsic and customer advances and contributions see note to the company s financial statements included herein 
customer advances and contributions are expected to account for less than of funding requirements in and the company believes it will have adequate credit facilities and access to the capital markets  if necessary during  to fund anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources cash the company manages its cash through a cash management account that is directly connected to a line of credit 
excess cash generated automatically pays down outstanding borrowings under the line of credit arrangement 
if there are no outstanding borrowings  the cash is used as an earnings credit to reduce banking fees 
likewise  if additional funds are needed  besides what is generated internally  for payroll  to pay suppliers  or to pay debt service  funds are automatically borrowed under the line of credit 
the cash balance of  at december  represents the balance of the proceeds of the october long term debt issue plus the funds from operations generated internally in primarily due to lower cash required for income taxes due to bonus depreciation 
the company expects the cash balance to decline in based on currently allowable bonus depreciation 
after the cash balance is fully utilized  the cash management facility is expected to provide the necessary liquidity and funding for the company s operations for the foreseeable future based on its past experience 

back to table of contents page accounts receivable recently the company has noticed a decline in the timeliness of payments by its customers and an increase in the number of inactive accounts with outstanding balances 
the company has increased its allowance for doubtful accounts in consideration of this trend 
if this trend continues  the company may incur additional expenses for uncollectible accounts and experience a reduction in its internally generated funds 
the company made a one time adjustment during the second quarter of to the allowance and corresponding provision for doubtful accounts for inactive accounts that were written off during the second half of the amount of the adjustment was not considered material to the financial statements 
no further adjustments are expected in internally generated funds the amount of internally generated funds available for operations and construction depends on the company s ability to obtain timely and adequate rate relief  customers water usage  weather conditions  customer growth and controlled expenses 
in  the company generated  internally as compared to  in and  in the reduction in income taxes paid increased cash flow from operating activities 
credit lines historically  the company has borrowed  to  under its lines of credit before refinancing with long term debt or equity capital 
as of december   the company maintained unsecured lines of credit aggregating  with three banks at interest rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus 
the company had no outstanding borrowings under any of its lines of credit as of december  the company plans to renew a  line of credit that expires in june under similar terms and conditions 
the credit and liquidity crisis which began in has caused substantial volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets and in the banking industry resulting in increased borrowing costs and reduced credit availability 
since then  the company has experienced more stability as the economy recovers from the recession 
actual interest rates remain low and two of the company s banks recently reduced the interest rate on its lines of credit 
one of the lines of credit continues to carry a commitment fee  although it has been reduced 
the company has taken steps to manage the risk of reduced credit availability such as maintaining primarily committed lines of credit that cannot be called on demand and obtaining a year revolving maturity 
despite the general improvements and actions taken  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to obtain sufficient lines of credit with favorable terms in the future 
in addition  if the company is unable to refinance its line of credit borrowings with long term debt or equity when necessary  it may have to eliminate or postpone capital expenditures 
the company was able to pay off its line of credit borrowings by issuing long term debt in october management believes the company will have adequate capacity under its current lines of credit to meet financing needs throughout long term debt the company s loan agreements contain various covenants and restrictions 
management believes it is currently in compliance with all of these restrictions 
see note to the company s financial statements included herein for additional information regarding these restrictions 
the pennsylvania economic development financing authority exempt facilities revenue bonds  series b  contain special redemption provisions 
under these provisions  representatives of deceased beneficial owners of the bonds have the right to request redemption prior to the stated maturity of all or part of their interest in the bonds 
in  the company retired under these provisions 
currently  no additional bonds that met the special provisions have been tendered for redemption 
the company is not obligated to redeem any individual interest exceeding  or aggregate interest exceeding in any annual period 
the company s debt long term debt plus current portion of long term debt as a percentage of the total capitalization  defined as total common stockholders equity plus long term debt including current portion of long term debt  was as of december   compared with as of december  as debt load trends upward in the future  the company will likely match increasing debt with increasing equity so that its debt to total capitalization ratio remains at nearly fifty percent 
this capital structure has historically been acceptable to the ppuc in that prudent debt costs and a fair return have been granted by the ppuc in rate filings 
see note to the company s financial statements included herein for the details of its long term debt outstanding as of december  
back to table of contents page the company has an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission sec  pursuant to which the company may offer an aggregate remaining amount of up to  of its common stock or debt securities subject to market conditions at the time of any such offering 
the company is not currently planning to issue securities under the shelf registration statement in deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions the company has seen an increase in its deferred income tax liability amounts over the last several years 
this is primarily a result of the accelerated and bonus depreciation deduction available for federal tax purposes which creates differences between book and tax depreciation expense 
the company expects this trend to continue as it makes significant investments in capital expenditures and as the tax code continues to extend bonus depreciation 
the company has a substantial deferred income tax asset primarily due to the differences between the book and tax balances of the pension and deferred compensation plans from lower discount rates 
the company does not believe a valuation allowance is required due to the expected generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
the company has determined there are no uncertain tax positions that require recognition as of december  common stock common stockholders equity as a percent of the total capitalization was as of december   compared with as of december  it is the company s intent to maintain a ratio near fifty percent 
under the shelf registration statement previously mentioned  the company has the ability to issue additional shares of its common stock  subject to market conditions at the time of any such offering 
credit rating the company s ability to maintain its credit rating depends  among other things  on adequate and timely rate relief  which it has been successful in obtaining  and its ability to fund capital expenditures in a balanced manner using both debt and equity 
in  the company s objectives will be to continue to maximize its funds provided by operations and maintain the equity component of total capitalization 
dividends during  the company s dividend payout ratios relative to net income and net cash provided by operating activities were and  respectively 
during  the company s dividend payout ratios relative to net income and net cash provided by operating activities were and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors increased the dividend by from per share to per share per quarter 
this was the fifteenth consecutive annual dividend increase and the th consecutive year of paying dividends 
the company s board of directors declared a dividend in the amount of per share at its january meeting 
the dividend is payable on april  to shareholders of record as of february  while the company expects to maintain this dividend amount in  future dividends will be dependent upon the company s earnings  financial condition  capital demands and other factors and will be determined by the company s board of directors 
see note to the company s financial statements included herein for restrictions on dividend payments 
inflation the company is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs incurred to maintain and expand its service capacity 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility replacement costs which must be recovered from future cash flows 
the ability of the company to recover this increased investment in facilities is dependent upon future rate increases  which are subject to approval by the ppuc 
the company can provide no assurances that its rate increases will be approved by the ppuc  and  if approved  the company cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which the rate increase was sought

environmental matters in november during a routine tank cleaning  the company discovered a small amount of mercury in the bottom of the tank 
the tank was not in service at the time of the discovery and remains out of service 
a number of tests were performed to confirm no mercury entered the water supply and no employees or contractors present during the discovery were impacted 
the company is working with the dep and the epa to ensure proper removal and disposal of the mercury 
the tank will remain out of service until it is confirmed that it is free of any mercury 
no disruption of service to any customers has occurred or is expected to occur 
the company incurred total costs of which are included in operating expenses in the statement of income and represent all known costs related to the remediation 

back to table of contents page critical accounting estimates the methods  estimates and judgments the company used in applying its accounting policies have a significant impact on the results reported in its financial statements 
the company s accounting policies require management to make subjective judgments because of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting estimates include regulatory assets and liabilities  revenue recognition and accounting for its pension plans 
regulatory assets and liabilities generally accepted accounting principles define professional standards for companies whose rates are established by or are subject to approval by an independent third party regulator 
in accordance with the professional standards  the company defers costs and credits on its balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recognized in the rate making process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
these deferred amounts are then recognized in the statement of income in the period in which they are reflected in customer rates 
if the company later finds that these assets and liabilities cannot be included in rate making  they are adjusted appropriately 
see note for additional details regarding regulatory assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition revenues include amounts billed to metered customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on both actual and estimated usage from the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
estimates are based on average daily usage for those particular customers 
the unbilled revenue amount is recorded as a current asset on the balance sheet 
actual results could differ from these estimates and would result in operating revenues being adjusted in the period in which the actual usage is known 
based on historical experience  the company believes its estimate of unbilled revenues is reasonable 
pension accounting accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires estimates of future compensation increases  mortality  the discount rate  and expected return on plan assets as well as other variables 
these variables are reviewed annually with the company s pension actuary 
the company selected its december  and discount rates based on the citigroup pension liability index 
this index uses the citigroup spot rates for durations out to years and matches them to expected disbursements from the plan over the long term 
the company believes this index most appropriately matches its pension obligations 
the present values of the company s future pension obligations were determined using a discount rate of at december  and at december  choosing a lower discount rate normally increases the amount of pension expense and the corresponding liability 
in the case of the company  a reduction in the discount rate would increase its liability  but would not have an impact on its pension expense 
the ppuc  in a previous rate settlement  agreed to grant recovery of the company s contribution to the pension plans in customer rates 
as a result  under the professional standards  expense in excess of the company s pension plan contribution is deferred as a regulatory asset and will be expensed as contributions are made to the plans and the contributions are recovered in customer rates 
therefore  changes in the discount rate affect regulatory assets rather than pension expense 
the company s estimate of the expected return on plan assets is primarily based on the historic returns and projected future returns of the asset classes represented in its plans 
the target allocation of pension assets is to equity securities  to debt securities  and to cash reserves 
the company used as its estimate of expected return on assets in both and if the company were to reduce the expected return  its liability would increase  but its expense would again remain unchanged because the expense is equal to the company s contribution to the plans 
the additional expense would instead be recorded as an increase to regulatory assets 

back to table of contents page continued low discount rates and underperformance of assets could cause future required contributions and expense to increase substantially 
if this were to happen  the company would have to consider changes to its pension plan benefits and possibly request additional recovery of expenses through increased rates charged to customers

the proceeds of this bond issue were used to refund the  pedfa exempt facilities revenue bonds  series b of which were refunded due to bond insurer downgrading issues 
the pedfa then loaned the proceeds to the company pursuant to a variable interest rate loan agreement with a maturity date of october  in connection with the loan agreement  the company retained its interest rate swap agreement whereby the company exchanged its floating rate obligation for a fixed rate obligation 
the purpose of the interest rate swap is to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in the interest rate 
if the interest rate swap agreement works as intended  the receive rate on the swap should approximate the variable rate the company pays on the pedfa series a bond issue  thereby minimizing its risk
