european sovereign debt exposure throughout the notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we use certain acronyms and abbreviations 
these terms are defined in note summary of significant accounting policies which begins on page 
table of contents introduction this section generally reviews the financial condition and results of operations of keycorp and its subsidiaries for each of the past three years 
some tables may include additional periods to comply with disclosure requirements or to illustrate trends in greater depth 
when you read this discussion  you should also refer to the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this report 
the page locations of specific sections that we refer to are presented in the table of contents 
terminology throughout this discussion  references to key  we  our  us and similar terms refer to the consolidated entity consisting of keycorp and its subsidiaries 
keycorp refers solely to the parent holding company  and keybank refers to keycorp s subsidiary bank  keybank national association 
we want to explain some industry specific terms at the outset so you can better understand the discussion that follows 
we use the phrase continuing operations in this document to mean all of our businesses other than the education lending business and austin 
results for the education lending business and austin have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
our exit loan portfolios are separate from our discontinued operations 
these portfolios  which are in a run off mode  stem from product lines we decided to cease because they no longer fit with our corporate strategy 
these exit loan portfolios are included in other segments 
we engage in capital markets activities primarily through business conducted by our key corporate bank segment 
these activities encompass a variety of products and services 
among other things  we trade securities as a dealer  enter into derivative contracts both to accommodate clients financing needs and for proprietary trading purposes  and conduct transactions in foreign currencies both to accommodate clients needs and to benefit from fluctuations in exchange rates 
for regulatory purposes  capital is divided into two classes 
federal regulations currently prescribe that at least one half of a bank or bank holding company s total risk based capital must qualify as tier capital 
both total and tier capital serve as bases for several measures of capital adequacy  which is an important indicator of financial stability and condition 
as described in the section entitled supervision and regulation  the regulators are required to conduct a supervisory capital assessment of the bhcs with assets of at least billion  including keycorp 
as part of this capital adequacy review  banking regulators evaluate a component of tier capital  known as tier common equity 
for more information on total capital  tier capital and tier common equity  and how they are calculated see the section entitled capital 
during the first quarter of  we re aligned our reporting structure for our segments 
previously  the consumer finance business group consisted mainly of portfolios that were identified as exit or run off portfolios and were included in our key corporate bank segment 
we are now reflecting these exit loan portfolios in other segments 
the automobile dealer floor plan business  previously included in consumer finance  has been re aligned with the commercial banking line of business within the key community bank segment 
in addition  other previously identified exit portfolios included in the key corporate bank segment  including our homebuilder loans from the real estate capital line of business and commercial leases from the equipment finance line of business  have been moved to other segments 
for more detailed financial information pertaining to each segment and its respective lines of business  see note line of business results 
additionally  a comprehensive list of the acronyms and abbreviations used throughout this discussion is included in note summary of significant accounting policies

economic overview economic and political uncertainty and financial market volatility were the dominant themes throughout the year began with optimism that the economic recovery in the united states was finally gaining momentum three years after the financial crisis of sparked the worst recession since the great depression 
that optimism quickly faded during the first quarter of after multiple economic shocks interrupted the recovery 
first  political unrest in north africa and the middle east resulted in volatility in oil and gas prices  lessening the consumer s discretionary purchasing power 
then the natural disasters in japan created manufacturing supply chain disruptions  which slowed us industrial production and growth 
finally  awareness of the sovereign debt crisis in europe increased and financial market volatility heightened 
equity markets reeled over fears that fiscal austerity in europe would lead to a weakening of their banking sector  and european leaders were unable to allay those concerns 
the environment was further intensified by the us debt ceiling debate that ultimately led to the historic downgrade of the united states aaa credit rating by standard poor s 
us employers added million jobs in this compares favorably to the million jobs added in the unemployment rate in december of decreased to  compared to the rate at the end of while the unemployment rate showed improvement throughout the year  it remained considerably higher than the ten year average unemployment rate of 
despite the improving job market  us consumers  whose confidence had been rattled by the news headlines throughout the year  were hesitant to spend 
the average monthly rate of consumer spending increased for compared to an average monthly increase of for spending was also tempered by rising inflationary pressures  as consumer prices in december of increased at an annual rate of  up from the increase for all of the housing market remained weak throughout and continued to be a drag on the recovery 
in december of new home sales decreased from december of  while the median price of new homes decreased by over the same period 
building activity improved modestly as housing starts at the end of increased from a year earlier  but still remained at historically low levels 
existing home sales also remained weak as lower mortgage rates and price discounts were not enough to lure buyers back into the market 
in december of existing home sales increased from the same month a year ago  and the median price of existing homes decreased by over the same period 
while remaining historically elevated  the number of new foreclosures decreased in december of from a year earlier 
the federal reserve held the federal funds target rate near zero and took further accommodative monetary policy actions in the federal reserve continued to expand its holdings of treasury securities during the first half of the year as announced in november of as the economic outlook weakened in the second half of  the federal reserve attempted to increase its transparency in august by stating that it would keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid the federal reserve updated this communication in january of to indicate that conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late furthermore  in an attempt to lower longer term borrowing rates to consumers and businesses  the federal reserve announced a program in september dubbed operation twist by investors 
this program involves the federal reserve purchasing billion of u

treasury securities with longer maturities

these actions along with the recognition of a weakening global economy contributed to a drop in benchmark term interest rates

we will continue to stress the importance of training  retaining  developing and challenging our employees 
we believe through our employees focused execution we will continue to win with our clients and drive results consistent with our strategic priorities 
strategic developments we initiated the following actions during and to support our corporate strategy we returned to profitability in and remained profitable throughout the results for were primarily due to lower credit costs and an improvement in noninterest expense  as compared to  as our new leadership team implemented their commitment to focused strategy execution 
on january   we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire retail branches in buffalo and rochester  ny 
the deposits associated with these branches total approximately billion  while loans total approximately million 
we will use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth 
the transaction is expected to close in late second or early third quarter of we were recognized in a survey by american customer satisfaction index  published in january of  showing that we are one of only two large banks that improved its overall customer satisfaction score for two consecutive years 
our score is significantly more positive than the banking industry overall 
during  we continued to benefit from improved asset quality 
from one year ago  nonperforming loans declined by million to million  and nonperforming assets decreased by million to million 
net charge offs during declined to million  or of average loan balances  compared to billion  or of average loan balances during at december  our capital ratios remained strong with a tier common equity ratio of  our loan loss reserves were adequate at to period end loans and we were core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 
our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to support our clients and our business needs and to evaluate other appropriate capital deployment opportunities 
for the year ended december   our efficiency ratio was 

table of contents as previously reported  key completed the repurchase of the billion of series b preferred stock and corresponding warrant issued to the us treasury department 
as a result of the repurchase  we recorded a million one time deemed dividend in the first quarter of related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase 
beginning with the second quarter of  the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of million and discount amortization of million  or million on an annual basis  related to these preferred shares 
in total  key paid billion to the us treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends  principal and repurchase of the warrant  resulting in a return to the us treasury of million above the initial investment of billion made on november  during march  we completed a million underwritten public offering of  of our common shares at a price of per share  and a public offering of billion senior medium term notes  series i 
in may  our board of directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to 
per common share or 
on an annualized basis 
this is a result of our return to sustained profitability  disciplined capital and expense management  and continued improvement in credit quality 
during the second half of  we formalized our key employee promise  which is that together  we have a strong sense of community where each one of us has the opportunity for personal growth  to do work that matters in a place where results are rewarded 
this promise is built on our core values and supports our growth strategy of building enduring relationships through client focused solutions and extraordinary service

in september  we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through key education resources  the education payment and financing unit of keybank 
as a result of these decisions  we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts 
b includes a million deemed dividend recorded in the first quarter of related to the repurchase of the billion series b preferred stock 
c eps may not foot due to rounding 
the earnings improvement in resulted from an improvement in credit quality  expense control and our success in growing our business when compared to results in were adversely impacted by an elevated provision for loan and lease losses  write offs of certain intangible assets and write downs of certain commercial real estate related investments 
in  we benefited from the actions taken to strengthen our balance sheet  reduce risk  reposition our business and rebuild capital 
our full year results  lead us to believe that we have returned to solid and sustainable profitability  reached an inflection point in our loan portfolio  and have established peer leading capital levels 
in  we will continue to focus on cost control efforts as we invest in client facing positions and technology  continue to optimize our non client facing positions and occupancy costs  expend for marketing where we can deepen client relationships to improve future revenue and implement efficiency initiatives 
the net interest margin from continuing operations was for this was a decrease of ten basis points from this decrease was primarily attributable to a lower yield on average earning assets compared to the prior year  resulting primarily from the continuation of the low rate environment 
we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts 
this benefit along with reductions in administered rate deposits allowed us to maintain the spread between interest earning assets and our cost of funds during compared to our expectation for is for the net interest margin to show modest improvement as we continue to anticipate our funding costs to decline 
average total loans increased million during the fourth quarter  compared to the third quarter of this represented a unannualized increase from the third quarter of  and is the first time we have grown 
table of contents quarterly average loan balances since the fourth quarter of the average balances of commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased from billion to billion  or approximately unannualized 
this is the third consecutive quarter average growth for the commercial  financial and agricultural portfolio 
our utilization rate of commercial  financial and agricultural loans improved from in the third quarter of to in the fourth quarter of this confirmed our belief that we reached an inflection point for loan growth in the third quarter of our exit loan portfolio accounted for million or   of our nonperforming assets at december  compared to million  or  at december   and million  or  at december  while we have made progress in decreasing our exit loan portfolio  we believe these loan balances will be running down more slowly in the future due to the longer term nature of these remaining loan portfolios 
our consolidated average loan to deposit ratio was for the fourth quarter of  compared to for the fourth quarter of this continued decline was accomplished by growing our noninterest bearing deposits  now and money market accounts  reducing our reliance on wholesale funding  exiting nonrelationship businesses and soft loan demand during the first half of we originated new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses of approximately billion during the fourth quarter and billion for this annual amount compares to approximately billion in  an increase of 
our trend of improving the mix of deposits continued during where we experienced a billion or increase in non time deposits 
approximately billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at december   will mature over the next four quarters  and included in these totals are approximately billion of higher costing certificates of deposit originated prior to the breakdown of these higher costing certificates of deposits is as follows million at a cost mature in the first quarter of  million at a cost mature in the second quarter of  billion at a cost mature in the third quarter of  and million at a cost mature in the fourth quarter of these re pricing opportunities will continue to benefit our net interest margin 
we experienced an improvement in our asset quality statistics during the fourth quarter of net charge offs declined to million or of average loan balances for as compared to billion and for in addition  our nonperforming loans declined to million or of period end loans at december  compared to billion or at december  our reserve for loan losses stood at billion or of period end loans compared to billion or at december   and represented and coverage of non performing loans at december  and december   respectively 
also  criticized loans outstanding declined at december  for the th consecutive quarter 
information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled credit risk management 
looking to  we anticipate continued improvement in asset quality  with lower levels of non performing assets and net charge offs for the year 
specifically with respect to net charge offs  during the first half of  we anticipate the amount to be comparable to the second half of we anticipate the provision to be less than net charge offs in however  we expect that as loan growth continues in  we will migrate during the course of the year for the provision to be closer to the level of net charge offs 
there are a number of variables that impact the ultimate outcome including the composition of the loan portfolio at each quarter end 

table of contents our tangible common equity ratio and tier common ratio both remain strong at december   at and respectively  as compared to and at december  these have placed us in the top quartile of our peer group on these ratios 
we have identified four primary uses of capital 
the first is investing in our businesses  supporting our clients and our loan growth 
second is maintaining or increasing our common stock dividend 
third is to return capital in the form of share repurchase to our shareholders 
and then fourth is to be disciplined and opportunistic about how we could invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitions over time 
the federal reserve is currently conducting a review of our capital plan under the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process 
until such time as they have completed their review and have no objection to our plan  we are not able to take any further actions to implement our plan 
in the event the federal reserve would object to our plan  in whole or in part  we may submit a request for reconsideration of our plan within days  which the federal reserve is required to respond to within days 
in such circumstances  absent receipt of a non objection following a request for reconsideration  we would be required to re submit our plan within days 
upon receipt of a re submitted capital plan  the federal reserve has days to notify the bhc of its objection or non objection 
should we receive an objection  it would likely delay any actions on capital management until later in the calendar year 
on january   we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire retail branches in buffalo and rochester  ny 
the deposits associated with these branches total approximately billion  while loans total approximately million 
we plan to use this excess liquidity to fund debt maturities and loan growth 
we are looking for opportunities to rationalize and optimize our existing branch network 
in  we plan to build approximately new branches as compared to new branches in our focus will shift more toward relocations and consolidations to reposition our branch footprint  into more attractive market areas 
over the last two years  we have built new branches  which net of closures and consolidations resulted in a net addition to our network of branches 
in addition  we have renovated approximately branches during this time period 
in total  approximately of our branches are either new or have been renovated in the past five years as part of our branch modernization initiative 
figure presents certain non gaap financial measures related to tangible common equity and tier common equity 
the tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors 
we believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital  the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations 
since the commencement of the ccar process in early  the federal reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier risk based capital known as tier common equity  a non gaap financial measure 
because the federal reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders equity essentially tier risk based capital less preferred stock  qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries generally should be the dominant element in tier risk based capital  this focus on tier common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories 
this increased focus on tier common equity is also present in the basel committee s basel iii guidelines  which us regulators are expected to implement in the near future 
the enactment of the dodd frank act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as tier eligible capital 
this three year phase out period  which commences january   will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as tier capital 
tier common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  this measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure 
since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and tier common equity  we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases 
figure also reconciles the gaap performance measures to the corresponding non gaap measures 

table of contents the table also shows the computation for pre provision net revenue  which is not formally defined by gaap 
management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap

b other assets deducted from tier capital and net risk weighted assets consist of disallowed deferred tax assets of million at december   disallowed intangible assets excluding goodwill  and deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments 
there were no disallowed deferred tax assets at december  results of operations net interest income one of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets such as loans and securities and loan related fee income  and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings 
there are several factors that affect net interest income  including the volume  pricing  mix and maturity of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the volume and value of net free funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits and equity capital  the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk  
table of contents interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace  and asset quality 
to make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets some taxable  some not  we present net interest income in this discussion on a taxable equivalent basis ie  as if it were all taxable and at the same taxable rate 
for example  of tax exempt income would be presented as  an amount that if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of would yield figure shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense  and their respective yields or rates over the past six years 
this figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with gaap for each of those years 
the net interest margin  which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding  is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets 
taxable equivalent net interest income for was billion  and the net interest margin was 
these results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of billion and a net interest margin of for the prior year 
the decrease in net interest income is primarily attributable to a lower level of average earning assets compared to the prior year  resulting primarily from pay downs on higher yielding loans  and the continuation of the low rate environment decreasing the value of noninterest bearing liabilities 
we continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts 
we have also benefitted from pricing reductions on administered rate deposits 
average earning assets for totaled billion  which was billion  or  lower than the level 
this reduction reflects a billion decrease in loans during the year  caused by soft demand for credit  paydowns on our portfolios as commercial clients deleveraged  and the run off in our exit portfolios 
the size and composition of our loan portfolios were affected by the following actions during  and we sold billion of commercial real estate loans during and billion during since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse ie  there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements  we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate 
more information about the related recourse agreement is provided in note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees under the heading recourse agreement with fnma 
in addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above  we sold other loans totaling billion including billion of residential real estate loans during and billion including billion of residential real estate loans during in the fourth quarter of  we transferred loans with a fair value of million from held for sale status to the held to maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans 
we sold million of education loans included in discontinued assets on the balance sheet during in late september  we decided to exit the government guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report

the decline in the equity portfolio was due in part to asset outflows and market value declines 
the decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter decision to wind down the operations of austin results included in discontinued operations

severance expense also increased by million while stock based compensation decreased by million 
the decrease was due largely to a million decrease in our employee benefits expense 
the employee benefit expense decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense as a result of amending our cash balance pension plan to freeze future service benefit accruals and the resulting change in certain pension plan assumptions

this compares to a decrease of million during for the period  the secondary market for income property loans was severely constrained 
during this period of time  we provided interim financing for certain maturing income property loans 
beginning with the second half of and continuing throughout  market liquidity for income property loans showed significant improvement 
consequently  our clients need for interim financing has diminished and our portfolio of nonowner occupied income property loans has shown a steady decrease in outstanding principal balances 
since december   our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately billion or 
as shown in figure  at december   of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner occupied properties  compared to at december  approximately and of these loans were construction loans at december  and  respectively 
typically  construction properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan 
the borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments 
uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases  driving rental rates and occupancy rates down 
as we have experienced during  we expect vacancy rates for retail  office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly increase well into commercial real estate fundamentals appear to be approaching bottom  and certain sectors eg  apartments are showing signs of improvement 
according to property and portfolio research  inc  vacancy fell in the third quarter of in every major property type  but it remained above year ago levels with the exception of apartments 
rent growth remains flat to negative again with the exception of apartments  and is at or nearing a trough  however  modest declines are possible over the next year in office  retail  and warehouse property types 
once rents bottom  the anticipated recovery will likely be modest 

table of contents if the economic recovery stalls  and or job growth continues to disappoint  vacancies will remain elevated and downward pressure on rents and net operating income will remain 
the resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio  particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components  which comprise of our commercial real estate loans 
commercial property values peaked in the fall of  having experienced increases of approximately since and since the most recent moody s real estate analytics  llc commercial property price index november showed a drop in values from the peak in october as of november  the index was at  a increase from april april was the lowest point since the inception of the index in december of market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location 
over the past year  competition for the best assets in the top markets has driven prices higher  while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low and keeping trends negative 
if the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market ie  vacancy rates  the stability of rental income and asset values  leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments  our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected 
commercial lease financing 
we conduct financing arrangements through our key equipment finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business 
commercial lease financing receivables represented of commercial loans at december   and at december  commercial loan modification and restructuring certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients 
loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower 
in many cases  borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital  collateral  guarantees or income sources 
modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients financing needs 
modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as tdrs 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  tdr classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted 
our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions  principal deferral  or forgiveness of principal 
loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types 
as a result of  improving economic conditions combined with the restructuring of these loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower  we have seen certain of our restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance under the restructured loan terms for each primary type of concession over the past year 
for more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing tdrs  see note asset quality

similarly  appropriately sized a notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics  including demonstrated payment performance 
other benefits include the borrower s retention of ownership and control of the asset  deleveraged and sustainable capital structure often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed fire sales 
we use an a b note structure for tdrs  breaking the existing loan into two tranches 
this approach has many benefits for us and for our borrowers 
first  we create an a note 
as the objective of this tdr note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well rated a note  we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards 
this typically will include a debt coverage ratio of or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest  and principal amortization of generally not more than years 
appropriately sized a notes are more likely to return to accrual status  allowing us to resume recognizing interest income 
as the borrower s payment performance improves  these restructured notes also will allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification 
moreover  the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral typically  commercial real estate  the borrower s capital structure is strengthened often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction  and local markets are spared distressed fire sales 
the b note is typically an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow 
this excess cash flow is customarily applied directly to the principal of the a note 
we evaluate the b note when we consider returning the a note to accrual status 
in many cases  the b note is charged off at the same time the a note is returned to accrual status 
alternatively  both a and b notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive 
all loans processed as a tdr  including a notes and any non charged off b notes  are reported as tdrs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place 

table of contents returning an a note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time 
to that end  our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments 
we evaluate primary repayment derived from property cash flow to assess continued sustainability 
secondary repayment collateral is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the a note with a sufficient excess generally 
although our policy is a guideline  considerable judgment is required to review each borrower s circumstances 
extensions 
certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients 
project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity  however  due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates  an increased number of loans have been extended 
extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship  the status of the project and near term prospects for both the client and the collateral 
in all cases  pricing and loan structure are reviewed and where necessary modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms ie  amortization  covenants and term that are appropriate for the risk 
typical enhancements include one or more of the following principal paydown  increased amortization  additional collateral  increased guarantees  and or a cash flow sweep 
as previously mentioned  some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option  pricing and loan terms cannot be altered 
most project loans by their nature are collateral dependent as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan 
pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor  if any 
therefore  pricing may remain the same eg  the loan is already priced at or above current market 
we do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business under existing loan terms or at market rates as tdrs  particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made 
in the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a tdr 
extensions that qualify as tdrs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance 
guarantors 
a detailed guarantor analysis is conducted for all new extensions of credit  at the time of any material modification extension  and typically annually  as part of our on going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures 
this analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets  income statements  tax returns  and real estate schedules 
while the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences  the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities  including size  quality  and nature of asset base  net worth adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value  leverage  standing liquidity  recurring cash flow  contingent and direct debt obligations  and near term debt maturities 
borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within days of the calendar fiscal year end 
income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly 
in some cases  disclosure of certain information including liquidity  certifications  status of asset sales or debt resolutions  and real estate schedules may be required more frequently 
we routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt  if the guarantor is solvent 
in limited circumstances  we would not seek to enforce the guaranty  including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor s verified financial condition 
we are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss  cost and the expense of collections 
as of december   we had million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than  and were accounted for as performing loans 
these loans were not considered impaired due to one or 
table of contents more of the following factors i underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization  ii a satisfactory borrower payment history  and iii acceptable guarantor support 
consumer loan portfolio consumer loans outstanding decreased by million  or  from one year ago

capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance 
all of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at december  our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients needs  as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards expected to be promulgated under the dodd frank act or due to basel iii 
our shareholders equity to assets ratio was at december   compared to at december  our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was at december   compared to at december  banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries 
risk based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of risk weighted assets 
risk weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off balance sheet and market items  subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors 
currently  banks and bank holding companies must maintain  at a minimum  tier capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of and total capital as a percent of risk weighted assets of 
we expect us regulators to introduce new regulatory capital guidelines in  responding to both the dodd frank act and basel iii capital directives 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio and our total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  another indicator of capital adequacy  the leverage ratio  is defined as tier capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets 
bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s risk adjusted measure for market risk as we have must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
all other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 
as of december   our leverage ratio was compared to at december  the enactment of the dodd frank act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities being eligible tier risk based capital 
this three year phase out period  which commences january   will ultimately result in our capital securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts capital securities being treated only as tier capital 
these changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bhcs  savings and loan holding companies  and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important 
as of december   our tier risk based capital ratio  leverage ratio  and total risk based capital ratio were   and  respectively 
the capital securities issued by the keycorp capital trusts contribute billion or   and basis points to our tier risk based capital ratio  tier leverage ratio  and total risk based capital ratio  respectively  as of december  federal bank regulators group fdic insured depository institutions into five categories  ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized 
a well capitalized institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of for tier risk based capital  for tier leverage capital  and for total risk based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
if these provisions applied to bank holding companies  we would qualify as well capitalized at december  we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change 
analysis on a pro forma basis  accounting for the phase out of our capital securities as tier eligible and therefore as tier instead as of december   also determines that we would qualify as well capitalized under current regulatory guidelines  with the pro forma tier risk based capital ratio  pro forma leverage ratio  and pro forma total risk based capital ratio being

the current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function 
investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of keycorp or keybank 
a discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in item in the supervision and regulation section 
traditionally  the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital  the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations 
as a result of the financial crisis  the federal reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of tier risk based capital  known as tier common equity  and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies  including keycorp 
the capital modifications mandated by the dodd frank act and set forth in basel iii  which the federal reserve intends to implement in the near term  are consistent with the renewed focus on tier common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks  bhcs  and covered nonbank financial companies  which resulted from the financial crisis and  therefore  tier common equity is neither formally defined by gaap nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations  this measure is considered to be a non gaap financial measure 
figure in the highlights of our performance section reconciles key shareholders equity  the gaap performance measure  to tier common equity  the corresponding non gaap measure 
our tier common equity ratio was at december   compared to at december  at december   we had a consolidated federal net deferred tax asset of million and a state deferred tax liability of million compared to combined net federal and state deferred tax assets of million at december  prior to the third quarter of  we had been in a net deferred tax liability position 
generally  for risk based capital purposes  deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of i the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter end date  based on its projected future taxable income for the year  or ii of the amount of an institution s tier capital 
based on these restrictions  at december   we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from tier capital and risk weighted assets compared to million at december  we anticipate that we will not have a net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk based capital purposes as we believe we will be in a net deferred tax liability position in the coming quarters 
basel iii in december  the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation basel iii 
basel iii is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation  supervision and risk management of the banking sector  and introduces for the first time an official definition and guideline for tier common equity 
beginning on january   banks with regulators adopting the basel iii capital framework in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios common equity tier to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets 
the implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on january  at and be phased in over a four year period increasing by that amount on each subsequent january  until it reaches on january  
when the requirements for the fully phased in capital conservation buffer are included  the resulting minimum levels for tier capital and total risk based capital will be higher than the us s current well capitalized minimums 
a more thorough discussion of basel iii is included in item supervision and regulation section of this report  including a discussion of the fully phased in requirements at january  given our strong capital position  we expect to be able to satisfy the basel iii capital framework when us capital regulations corresponding to it are finalized 
while we also have a strong liquidity position  the basel iii liquidity framework could require us and other us banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives  including adding additional liquid assets  issuing term debt  and modifying our product pricing for loans  commitments  and deposits 
us regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the basel iii liquidity framework

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements we are party to various types of off balance sheet arrangements  which could lead to contingent liabilities or risks of loss that are not reflected on the balance sheet 
variable interest entities a vie is a partnership  limited liability company  trust or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria the entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party 
the entity s investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
the entity s equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns 
the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity  and substantially all of the entity s activities involve  or are conducted on behalf of  investors with disproportionately few voting rights 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations  we consolidate a vie if we have i a variable interest in the entity  ii the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and iii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie ie  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
additional information regarding the nature of vies and our involvement with them is included in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading basis of presentation and in note variable interest entities 
we use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies if we have significant influence over the entity s operating and financing decisions usually defined as a voting or economic interest of to  but not controlling 
unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or vies in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than generally are carried at cost 
investments held by our registered broker dealer and investment company subsidiaries primarily principal investments are carried at fair value 
commitments to extend credit or funding loan commitments provide for financing on predetermined terms as long as the client continues to meet specified criteria 
these commitments generally carry variable rates of interest and have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
we typically charge a fee for our loan commitments 
since a commitment may expire without resulting in a loan or being fully utilized  the total amount of an outstanding commitment may significantly exceed any related cash outlay 
further information about our loan commitments at december   is presented in note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees under the heading commitments to extend credit or funding

risk management overview like all financial services companies  we engage in business activities and assume the related risks 
the most significant risks we face are credit  liquidity  market  compliance  operational  strategic and reputation risks 
we must properly and effectively identify  assess  measure  monitor  control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability 
certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section 
our erm committee  which consists of the chief executive officer and other senior executives  is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite 
the erm program encompasses our risk philosophy  policy  framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company 
the erm committee reports to the risk management committee of our board of directors 
annually  the board of directors reviews and approves the erm program  as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories 
we use a risk adjusted capital framework to manage risks 
this framework is approved and managed by the erm committee 
our board of directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise wide risks in a manner that is effective  balanced and adds value for the shareholders 
the board inquires about risk practices  reviews the portfolio of risks  compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances  and receives regular reports about significant risks both actual and emerging 
to assist in these efforts  the board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the audit committee and the risk management committee 
the audit committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit  financial reporting  compliance risk and legal matters  the implementation  management and evaluation of operational risk and controls  information security and fraud risk 
the audit committee also is responsible for evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors 
the audit committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance 
the risk management committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk  market risk  interest rate risk and liquidity risk  including the actions taken to mitigate these risks  as well as reputational and strategic risks 
the risk management committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital  reviews the erm reports  and approves any material changes to the charter of the erm committee 
the audit and risk management committees meet jointly  as appropriate  to discuss matters that relate to each committee s responsibilities 
in addition to regularly scheduled bi monthly meetings  the audit committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases 
committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting 
all members of the board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months 
federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution 
we believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks  and comport with regulatory expectations 

table of contents market risk management the cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective yields  values or prices associated with the instrument 
for example  the value of a fixed rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase  while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase 
the holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when the cash flows or value of the instrument is tied to such external factors 
most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk  which is inherent in the banking industry  is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the eve 
such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates  and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the eve in accordance with our risk appetite  and within policy limits established by the erm committee 
interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products  economic conditions  the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging  investing  funding and capital positions 
the primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk  basis risk  yield curve risk and option risk 
gap risk is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest bearing liabilities and the volume of interest earning assets they fund for example  deposits used to fund loans do not mature or reprice at the same time 
basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities reprice at the same time  but in response to different market factors or indices 
yield curve risk is the exposure to non parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity and occurs when interest bearing liabilities and the interest earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve 
option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterparty s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets  liabilities or off balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty 
option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation 
net interest income simulation analysis 
the primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on and off balance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity 
the analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments  including a most likely macro economic scenario 
simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite 
typically  the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by basis points over 
table of contents the next twelve months  and term rates were to move in a similar fashion 
in light of the low interest rate environment  beginning in the fourth quarter of  we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months 
after calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes  we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment 
we also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments 
one set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures 
assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve  including a sustained flat yield curve  an inverted slope yield curve  changes in credit spreads  an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates 
another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures 
assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities  changes in lending spreads  prepayments on loans and securities  other loan and deposit balance shifts  investment  funding and hedging activities  and liquidity and capital management strategies 
simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model 
we tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled  and validate those assumptions on a regular basis 
our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on and off balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile 
however  actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition  customer behavior  product pricing  market interest rates  investment  funding and hedging activities  and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events 
figure presents the results of the simulation analysis at december  and at december   our simulated exposure to a change in short term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive 
alco policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 
as shown in figure  we are operating within these limits 
figure simulated change in net interest income december  basis point change assumption short term rates alco policy limits interest rate risk assessment december  basis point change assumption short term rates alco policy limits interest rate risk assessment as interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time  we have gradually shifted from a liability sensitive position to an asset sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances 
as the federal reserve s fomc has indicated that it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late  we continue to invest available funds and execute hedges to moderate further increases in the asset sensitive position 
these activities will continue to recognize the shift in the mix and maturity of customer deposits 
our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume  mix  maturity and re pricing characteristics of 
table of contents loan and deposit flows 
as changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy  management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile 
the results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished  and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in figure net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing  magnitude  frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re pricing relationships  lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts 
we also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three year horizon 
these simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve month horizon 
to capture longer term exposures  we calculate exposures to changes to the eve as discussed in the following section 
economic value of equity modeling 
eve complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve  twenty four and thirty six month horizons 
eve measures the extent to which the economic values of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates 
eve is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths 
under the current level of market interest rates  the calculation of eve under an immediate basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points 
this analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities 
those assumptions are based on historical behaviors  as well as our expectations 
we develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our eve will decrease by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
we are operating within these guidelines 
management of interest rate exposure 
we use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate a lm strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures 
specifically  we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities  issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates  and using derivatives predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps  which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
figure shows all swap positions that we hold for a lm purposes 
these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed upon amounts of assets and liabilities ie  notional amounts to another interest rate index 
for example  fixed rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap 
the volume  maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader a lm objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged

table of contents derivatives not designated in hedge relationships our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in note we use a var simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio 
using two years of historical information  the model estimates the maximum potential one day loss with a confidence level 
statistically  this means that losses will exceed var  on average  five out of trading days  or three to four times each quarter 
we manage exposure to market risk in accordance with var limits for trading activity that have been approved by the market risk committee which was established as part of our erm program 
at december   the aggregate one day trading limit set by the committee was million 
we are operating within these constraints 
during  our aggregate daily average  minimum and maximum var amounts were million  million and million  respectively 
in  our aggregate daily average  minimum and maximum var amounts were million  million and million  respectively 
in addition to comparing var exposure against limits on a daily basis  we monitor loss limits  use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests 
we report our market risk exposure to the risk management committee of the board of directors 
liquidity risk management we define liquidity as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned  as well as unanticipated  changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions 
governance structure we manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis 
this approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity  as well as each entity s capacity to manage through adverse conditions 
the approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding 
oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the risk management committee of the keycorp board of directors  the keybank board of directors  the erm committee and the alco 
these groups regularly review various liquidity reports  including liquidity and funding summaries  liquidity trends  peer comparisons  variance analyses  liquidity projections  hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports 
the reviews generate a discussion of positions  trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make 
when liquidity pressure is elevated  positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive 
we communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues 
in addition  we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds 
factors affecting liquidity our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events 
an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency 
examples of indirect events events unrelated to us that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war  natural disasters  political events  or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation  mutual fund or hedge fund 
similarly  market speculation  or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 

table of contents during the first quarter of  moody s a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities indicated to keybank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations had to be moved to another financial institution which meets moody s minimum ratings threshold 
as a result of this decision by moody s  on march   keybank transferred approximately billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptably rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets 
keybank had ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits 
managing liquidity risk we regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding 
in the normal course of business  we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both keycorp and keybank 
in a heightened monitoring mode  we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently  and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment 
our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies 
erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods 
ultimately  they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations 
to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures  we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 
at december   we have no secured borrowings outstanding 
however  we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source 
we maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis 
the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions 
it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period 
as part of the plan  we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio 
during a problem period  that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer term strategy 
the liquid asset portfolio at december  totaled billion  consisting of billion of unpledged securities  billion of securities available for secured funding at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati and billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our federal reserve account 
the liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate over time due to excess liquidity  heightened risk  or prefunding of expected outflows  such as debt maturities 
additionally  as of december   our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was billion at the federal reserve bank of cleveland and billion at the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
long term liquidity strategy our long term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits 
however  wholesale funds may be used to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio  meet daily cash demands  and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives 
key s client based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which  in conjunction with intermediate and long term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base  supports our liquidity risk management strategy 
we use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies 
our target loan to deposit ratio is at december  our loan to deposit ratio was  which we calculate as total loans  loans held for sale  and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of funding include customer deposits  wholesale funding  liquid assets  and capital 
if the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances  we rely on 
table of contents wholesale funding or liquid assets 
conversely  excess cash generated by operating  investing and deposit gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets 
we actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources  including short and long term debt  and secured borrowings 
liquidity programs we have several liquidity programs  which are described in note long term debt  that enable the parent company and keybank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally 
the proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed 
there are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs 
liquidity for keycorp the parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt  support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions and occasional guarantees of subsidiaries obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences  and pay dividends to shareholders 
our primary tools for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short term cash position  which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in months or less with existing liquid assets  and a cash coverage metric  which measures the ability to meet all projected obligations over months 
another key measure of parent company liquidity is the liquidity gap  which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons 
we generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods 
at december   the parent company held billion in short term investments  which we project to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations including the repayment our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies 
typically  the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from keybank 
federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval 
a national bank s dividend paying capacity is affected by several factors  including net profits as defined by statute for the two previous calendar years and for the current year  up to the date of dividend declaration 
during  keybank paid million in dividends to the parent  and nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent million in cash dividends  and million in noncash dividends 
during  the parent did not make any capital infusions to keybank  compared to million during based upon existing regulatory guidance  keybank has capacity to pay billion in dividends to keycorp at january  during the first quarter of  the parent company completed a million equity offering at a price of per common share 
in conjunction with the equity offering  the parent company issued billion  senior medium term notes  series i  during the first quarter of the proceeds from the sale of common shares and medium term notes were used  along with other available funds  to repurchase the series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury 
the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of million and discount amortization non cash of million  or million on an annual basis  related to these preferred shares 
our liquidity position and recent activity over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio  which includes overnight and short term investments  as well as unencumbered  high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios  has decreased as a result of capital securities redemptions and net customer loan and deposit flows 
however  the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through a liquidity event 
liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources  as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals 

table of contents from time to time  keycorp or its principal subsidiary  keybank  may seek to retire  repurchase or exchange outstanding debt  capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase  privately negotiated transactions or other means 
such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity and capital requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
we generate cash flows from operations  and from investing and financing activities 
during  we used the proceeds from our debt and common share offerings to repurchase our series b preferred stock issued to the us treasury as part of the tarp cpp and to pay dividends 
as previously noted  the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of million and discount amortization non cash of million  or million on an annual basis  related to these preferred shares 
we have approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of december  as we consider alternative long term strategic and liquidity plans  opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately million in taxes to be paid 
if we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions  the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately million 
accordingly  we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at december  the consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each year ended december   and credit ratings our credit ratings at december   are shown in figure we believe that these credit ratings  under normal conditions in the capital markets  will enable the parent company or keybank to issue fixed income securities to investors 
conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the latter part of and in the fourth quarter of  moody s a credit rating agency that rates keycorp and keybank debt securities announced a one notch downgrade of keybanks s short term borrowings  senior long term debt  and subordinated debt 
as a result of this decision by moody s  on march   keybank transferred approximately billion of certain escrow deposit balances to an acceptably rated institution resulting in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets 
for more information regarding this transfer of escrow deposit balances and the related mortgage servicing assets see note mortgage servicing assets 
more recently on december   standard poor s announced a ratings review of north american regional banks and their subsidiaries under its new bank ratings criteria announced november  s p s updated their ratings outlook on both keycorp and keybank from stable to positive  and maintained the ratings for keycorp and keybank

table of contents credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms 
like other financial services institutions  we make loans  extend credit  purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts  all of which have related credit risk 
credit policy  approval and evaluation we manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program 
the credit risk committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies 
these policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit 
our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval  is independent of our lines of business  and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans 
only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies 
it is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate  but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level 
loan grades are assigned at the time of origination  verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter 
most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring 
this risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling 
commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings 
the first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation  the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility 
default probability is determined based on  among other factors  the financial strength of the borrower  an assessment of the borrower s management  the borrower s competitive position within its industry sector  and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook 
types of exposure  transaction structure and collateral  including credit risk mitigants  affect the expected recovery assessment 
our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans 
these models  known as scorecards  forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant 
the scorecards are embedded in the application processing system  which allows for real time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products 
we periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes 
we maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios 
for individual obligors  we employ a sliding scale of exposure  known as hold limits  which is dictated by the strength of the borrower 
our legal lending limit is approximately billion for any individual borrower 
however  internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than of that amount 
as of december   we had four client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than million 
the average amount outstanding on these four individual net obligor commitments was million at december  in general  our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures 
we actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives  including the use of credit derivatives primarily credit default swaps to mitigate credit risk 
credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party 
at december   we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations 
we also sell credit derivatives primarily index credit default swaps to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks 
at december   the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was million 
occasionally  we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps 
these transactions with other lenders generated fee income 

table of contents credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
related gains or losses  as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection  are included in the trading income component of noninterest income 
we also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales 
our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality 
selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in figure the factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section

watch and criticized assets watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 
criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead  or have led  to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources  potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources  such as collateral liquidation 
criticized loan and lease outstandings showed improvement during decreasing from one year ago 
allowance for loan and lease losses at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was billion  or of loans  compared to billion  or  at december  the allowance includes million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of million at december   compared to million that was allocated for impaired loans of million one year ago 
for more information about impaired loans  see note asset quality 
at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was of nonperforming loans  compared to at december  we estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis 
the methodology used is described in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses 
briefly  we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions  changes in credit policies or underwriting standards  and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
for all commercial tdrs  regardless of size  as well as impaired commercial 
table of contents loans having an outstanding balance greater than million  we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate 
a specific allowance also may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full 
the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date 
as shown in figure  our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by million  or  during the past twelve months 
this contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio  which has trended more favorably along with the decrease in loan levels over the past twelve months 
asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance 
our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving 
we attribute this to a more moderate level of economic activity  more favorable conditions in the capital markets  improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio 
our liability for credit losses on lending related commitments decreased by million to million at december   compared to the same period one year ago 
when combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses  our total allowance for credit losses represented of loans at the end of compared to at the end of we expect the allowance to decrease as a percent of total loans during as a result of anticipated improvement in credit quality

table of contents our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of million for  compared to a provision of million for our net loan charge offs for exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses by million

these events include  among other things  threats to our cybersecurity  as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities 
operational risk also encompasses compliance risk  which is the risk of loss from violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules and regulations  prescribed practices  and ethical standards 
due to the passage of the dodd frank act  large financial companies like key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance 
this heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk 
we have created work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the dodd frank act 
resulting operational risk losses and or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges  increased operational costs  harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities 
we seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk  alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance  and a system of internal controls and reporting 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws  rules and regulations 
for example  an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses 
this tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action 
we also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes 
this technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the board of directors 

table of contents primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business 
our operational risk management function manages the operational risk management program which provides the framework for the structure  governance  roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for key 
the operational risk committee  a senior management committee  oversees our level of operational risk  and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities 
this committee and the operational risk management function are an integral part of our erm program 
our risk review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our operational risk management program and our system of internal controls 
risk review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the audit committee  and independently supports the audit committee s oversight of these controls 
fourth quarter results our financial performance for each of the past eight quarters is summarized in figure highlights of our results for the fourth quarter of are summarized below 
earnings we had a fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of million  or 
per common share  compared to a net income from continuing operations attributable to key common shareholders of million  or 
per common share  for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter results were negatively impacted by a million charge resulting from visa s late fourth quarter announcement of a planned litigation escrow deposit 
in addition  key recorded a million gain on the sale of tuition management systems during the fourth quarter of fourth quarter net income attributable to key common shareholders was million compared to net income attributable to key common shareholders of million for the same quarter one year ago 
on an annualized basis  our return on average total assets from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of was  compared to for the fourth quarter of the annualized return on average common equity from continuing operations was for the fourth quarter of  compared to for the year ago quarter 
net interest income our taxable equivalent net interest income was million for the fourth quarter of  and the net interest margin was 
these results compare to taxable equivalent net interest income of million and a net interest margin of for the fourth quarter of the decrease in net interest income is attributable to both a decline in earning assets and the net interest margin 
the net interest margin has been under pressure as a result of the continuation of the low rate environment contracting the spread between lending rates and funding costs 
noninterest income our noninterest income was million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the year ago quarter 
investment banking and capital markets income decreased million compared to the same period one year ago  which includes a million charge resulting from visa s late fourth quarter announcement of a planned increase to its litigation escrow deposit 
other income also decreased from the year ago quarter due to a million gain from the sale of tuition management systems in the fourth quarter of also contributing to the decline in noninterest income were decreases in operating lease income of million and net securities gains losses of million 
electronic banking fees also declined million as a result of new government pricing controls on debit transactions which were effective october  
table of contents noninterest expense our noninterest expense was million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the same period last year 
the improvement in expense levels resulted from declines of million in fdic deposit insurance premiums  million in operating lease expense and reductions across several other expense categories 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in employee benefits expense due to higher medical claims expense compared to the year ago quarter when key recorded a reduced amount due to favorable experience 
in addition  the fourth quarter reflected a credit of million in the provision credit for losses on lending related commitments compared to a credit of million in the same period one year ago 
provision for loan and lease losses our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of million for the fourth quarter of  compared to a credit of million for the year ago quarter and a charge of million for the third quarter of key s allowance for loan and lease losses was billion  or of total period end loans  at december   compared to at september   and at december  net loan charge offs for the quarter totaled million  or

these results compare to million  or  for the same period last year and million  or  for the previous quarter 
net loan charge offs have declined for the last eight consecutive quarters and were less than one percent of average loans for the second consecutive quarter 
income taxes for the fourth quarter of  we recorded a tax provision from continuing operations of million compared to a tax provision of million for the fourth quarter of the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of was compared with for the same quarter one year prior 
for the fourth quarter of  the tax rate was lower due to lower pre tax income and slightly higher tax credits earned during the period

c represents period end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale excluding education loans in securitizations trusts divided by period end consolidated total deposits excluding deposits in foreign office 
critical accounting policies and estimates our business is dynamic and complex 
consequently  we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies 
these choices are critical  not only are they necessary to comply with gaap  they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance 
in our opinion  some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility 
these policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance  or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances  they may prove to be inaccurate  or we may find it necessary to change them 
as described below  we rely heavily on the use of judgment  assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions 
we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee 
allowance for loan and lease losses the loan portfolio is the largest category of assets on our balance sheet 
we consider a variety of data to determine probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio and to establish an allowance that is sufficient to absorb those losses 
for example  we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions  lending policies  underwriting standards  and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets 
other considerations include expected cash flows and estimated collateral values 
for all commercial troubled debt restructurings  regardless of size  as well as all other impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than million  we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate 
for example  a specific allowance may be assigned even when sources of repayment appear sufficient if we remain uncertain that an impaired loan will be repaid in full 
we continually assess the risk profile of the loan portfolio and adjust the allowance for loan and lease losses when appropriate 
the economic and business climate in any given industry or market is difficult to gauge and can change rapidly  and the effects of those changes can vary by borrower 
however  since our total loan portfolio is well diversified in many respects  and the risk profile of certain segments of the loan portfolio may be improving while the risk profile of others is deteriorating  we may decide to change the level of the allowance for one segment of the portfolio without changing it for any other segment 
in addition to adjusting the allowance for loan and lease losses to reflect market conditions  we also may adjust the allowance because of unique events that are likely to cause actual losses to vary abruptly and significantly from expected losses 
for example  class action lawsuits brought against an industry segment eg  one that used asbestos in its product can cause a precipitous deterioration in the risk profile of borrowers doing business in that segment 
conversely  the dismissal of such lawsuits can improve the risk profile 
in either case  historical loss rates for that industry segment would not have provided a precise basis for determining the appropriate level of allowance 

table of contents even minor changes in the level of estimated losses can significantly affect management s determination of the appropriate level of allowance because those changes must be applied across a large portfolio 
to illustrate  an increase in estimated losses equal to one tenth of one percent of our consumer loan portfolio as of december   would indicate the need for a million increase in the level of the allowance 
the same level of increase in estimated losses for the commercial loan portfolio would result in a million increase in the allowance 
such adjustments to the allowance for loan and lease losses can materially affect financial results 
following the above examples  a million increase in the consumer loan portfolio allowance would have reduced our earnings on an after tax basis by approximately million  or 
per share  a million increase in the commercial loan portfolio allowance would have reduced earnings on an after tax basis by approximately million  or 
per share 
as we make decisions regarding the allowance  we benefit from a lengthy organizational history and experience with credit evaluations and related outcomes 
nonetheless  if our underlying assumptions later prove to be inaccurate  the allowance for loan and lease losses would likely need to be adjusted  possibly having an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our accounting policy related to the allowance is disclosed in note under the heading allowance for loan and lease losses 
valuation methodologies we follow the applicable accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using internally developed models  which are based on third party data as well as our judgment  assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality  liquidity  interest rates and other relevant market available inputs 
we describe our application of this accounting guidance  the process used to determine fair values and the fair value hierarchy in note under the heading fair value measurements and in note fair value measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve significant judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
to determine the values of assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  we make assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results 
the outcomes of valuations that we perform have a direct bearing on the recorded amounts of assets and liabilities  including loans held for sale  principal investments  goodwill  and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
at december   billion  or  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
substantially all of these assets were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
at december   billion  or  of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
substantially all of these liabilities were classified as level or level at december   million  or  of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
approximately of these assets were classified as level or level at december   there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
a discussion of the valuation methodology applied to our loans held for sale is included in note under the heading loans held for sale 
our principal investments include direct and indirect investments  predominantly in privately held companies 
the fair values of these investments are determined by considering a number of factors  including the target company s financial condition and results of operations  values of public companies in comparable businesses  
table of contents market liquidity  and the nature and duration of resale restrictions 
the fair value of principal investments was million at december  a positive or negative variance in that fair value would have increased or decreased our earnings by approximately million million after tax  or 
per share 
the valuation and testing methodologies used in our analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
our reporting units for purposes of this testing are our two major business segments key community bank and key corporate bank 
fair values are estimated using comparable external market data market approach and discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and earnings forecast information income approach 
we perform a sensitivity analysis of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit as appropriate 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for our reporting units are reasonable 
however  if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used  the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value  suggesting goodwill impairment 
in such a case  we would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit s net assets excluding goodwill 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
due to the economic uncertainty experienced since  we have conducted quarterly reviews of the applicable goodwill impairment indicators and evaluated the carrying amount of our goodwill  as necessary 
at december   the key community bank reporting unit had million in goodwill  while the key corporate bank reporting unit had no recorded goodwill 
as a result of our sale of tuition management systems in december  customer relationship intangible assets of million were written off against the purchase price to determine the net gain during during  we recorded noncash charges for intangible assets impairment of million million after tax  or 
per common share 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets for a summary of the events that resulted in these charges 
the primary assumptions used in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses  including sensitivity analysis of these assumptions  are presented in note employee benefits 
when potential asset impairment is identified  we must exercise judgment to determine the nature of the potential impairment ie  temporary or other than temporary to apply the appropriate accounting treatment 
for example  unrealized losses on securities available for sale that are deemed temporary are recorded in shareholders equity  those deemed other than temporary are recorded in either earnings or shareholders equity based on certain factors 
additional information regarding temporary and other than temporary impairment on securities available for sale at december   is provided in note securities 
derivatives and hedging we use primarily interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes 
these derivative instruments modify the interest rate characteristics of specified on balance sheet assets and liabilities 
our accounting policies related to derivatives reflect the current accounting guidance  which provides that all derivatives should be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value  after taking into account the effects of master netting agreements 
accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains or losses of a particular derivative depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 

table of contents the application of hedge accounting requires significant judgment to interpret the relevant accounting guidance  as well as to assess hedge effectiveness  identify similar hedged item groupings  and measure changes in the fair value of the hedged items 
we believe our methods of addressing these judgments and applying the accounting guidance are consistent with both the guidance and industry practices 
however  interpretations of the applicable accounting guidance continue to change and evolve 
in the future  these evolving interpretations could result in material changes to our accounting for derivative financial instruments and related hedging activities 
although such changes may not have a material effect on our financial condition  a change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which it occurs 
additional information relating to our use of derivatives is included in note under the heading derivatives and note derivatives and hedging activities 
contingent liabilities  guarantees and income taxes note commitments  contingent liabilities and guarantees summarizes contingent liabilities arising from litigation and contingent liabilities arising from guarantees in various agreements with third parties under which we are a guarantor  and the potential effects of these items on the results of our operations 
we record a liability for the fair value of the obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of a guarantee  but there is a risk that our actual future payments in the event of a default by the guaranteed party could exceed the recorded amount 
see note for a comparison of the liability recorded and the maximum potential undiscounted future payments for the various types of guarantees that we had outstanding at december  it is not always clear how the internal revenue code and various state tax laws apply to transactions that we undertake 
in the normal course of business  we may record tax benefits and then have those benefits contested by the irs or state tax authorities 
we have provided tax reserves that we believe are adequate to absorb potential adjustments that such challenges may necessitate 
however  if our judgment later proves to be inaccurate  the tax reserves may need to be adjusted  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and capital 
additionally  we conduct quarterly assessments that determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized  and therefore recorded 
the available evidence used in connection with these assessments includes taxable income in prior periods  projected future taxable income  potential tax planning strategies and projected future reversals of deferred tax items 
these assessments are subjective and may change 
based on these criteria  and in particular our projections for future taxable income  we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax asset in future periods 
however  if our assessments prove incorrect  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which they occur 
for further information on our accounting for income taxes  see note income taxes
