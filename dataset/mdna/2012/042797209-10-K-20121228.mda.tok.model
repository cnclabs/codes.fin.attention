ii part i item business description of business overview arrowhead research corporation is a clinical stage targeted therapeutics company with development programs in oncology  obesity  and chronic hepatitis b virus infection 
arrowhead is focused on creating new therapeutics that are preferentially taken up by target tissues in order to maximize a drug s efficacy and potentially limit side effects associated with exposure to healthy cells 
arrowhead has assembled a broad set of technologies and licenses to enable targeted rnai therapeutics capable of silencing specific gene products in specific cells 
arrowhead has also assembled a proprietary targeting library that may be used with its rnai platforms as well as with small molecule or peptide drugs 
these platforms have yielded several drug candidates under both internal and partnered development 
lead product candidates adipotide is an anti obesity peptide that has been shown to promote weight loss in animal models 
it is the first drug candidate from arrowhead s homing peptide platform and entered a phase clinical trial in arc is an rnai based therapeutic designed to treat chronic hepatitis b virus hbv infection 
it is the first drug candidate from arrowhead s dynamic polyconjugates sirna delivery platform and is expected to enter clinical trials in calaa is an rnai based therapeutic that targets solid tumors 
it employs the rondel rnai delivery technology and completed a phase b clinical trial in platform technologies the dynamic polyconjugate dpc platform is a small rna delivery system that may be targeted to address multiple organ systems and cell types 
it is a modular system that may be optimized on a target by target basis and has been demonstrated to promote multi log gene knockdown in rodents and non human primates  induce efficient endosomal escape  and has wide safety margins using a variety of sirna molecules 
rondel is a small rna delivery system that has demonstrated effective systemic sirna delivery  rnai mediated mrna and protein knockdown in human melanoma patients 
arrowhead s homing peptides platform is a vast  proprietary library of short peptides that have demonstrated rapid and specific internalization into a wide variety of cell types 
this library is being mined for the potential development of peptide drug conjugates pdcs and companion diagnostics 
arrowhead plans to develop the targeting peptides for use with its rna delivery platforms as well as with traditional small molecule or peptide drugs 
primary strategic opportunities delivering sirna rna interference rnai is a naturally occurring mechanism that effects gene expression 
short interfering rnas sirnas have been shown to trigger rnai and are thought to be a potentially powerful and specific way of silencing expression of disease causing gene products 
however  the lack of effective and safe delivery has impeded progress of the field 
arrowhead has multiple polymer based  non lipid delivery systems that enable development of rnai therapeutics 
importantly  arrowhead s delivery systems have been validated in multiple species and have demonstrated high levels of efficiency and specificity with wide safety margins 
enabling targeted drugs examples of guided therapeutics producing positive patient outcomes are rapidly emerging 
arrowhead s human derived targeting library  comprised of over  peptides  is being mined to create pdcs designed to home specifically to target cells 
pdcs have the potential to produce the advantages of antibody drug conjugates while bringing new benefits such as ease of manufacturing 
patient population enrichment strategies arrowhead s targeting library can be used for companion diagnostics that identify patient populations most likely to respond to a particular treatment  thus moving toward more personalized medicine 
improving generics arrowhead s targeting library can be used to make pdcs with generics designed to have an improved efficacy and safety profile as compared to untargeted counterparts 
arrowhead s internal drug pipeline is intended to drive value directly through the development of novel therapeutics and to provide proof of concept for the platform technologies 
we actively seek collaboration and licensing agreements with leading biopharmaceutical companies to augment their pipelines through the application of our technologies and to advance the development and commercialization of our own technology platforms and drug candidates 
partnerships are intended to provide access to external expertise and capital to complement our internal development and create commercialization opportunities in areas outside of our core focus 
recent events fiscal brought substantial change to arrowhead 
we have executed on our long term strategy of transitioning from a nanotechnology holding company in multiple industries to a focused biotech model 
we are now a unified therapeutics company developing actively guided drugs that interact preferentially with target tissues based on broad rnai and peptide targeting technology platforms 
arrowhead made two acquisitions in fiscal these acquisitions included new technology platforms  r d infrastructure and expertise  and operating and business development management 
we believe these acquisitions provide us with a solid foundation to discover and develop drug candidates and support partnerships that we expect will drive long term value for our shareholders 
some of the key steps in this transformation were acquired the rnai therapeutics business assembled by roche  which provided us with the following sirna delivery technologies  the most advanced of which is dynamic polyconjugates dpcs  license to multiple sirna structures and chemistries in key therapeutic areas  a state of the art  square foot r d facility with complete small animal facilities  r d staff of scientists  and multiple pre clinical drug development programs  including an sirna therapeutic for chronic hepatitis b infection  which is approaching an ind filing as arc acquired alvos therapeutics  inc providing arrowhead with a library of peptide targeting sequences used to create pdcs as well as intellectual property that can be used to generate novel targeting antibodies  augmented our management team by hiring accomplished biopharma executives bruce given  md as chief operating officer and head of r d  and brendan rae  phd  phd  as chief business officer  created a centralized infrastructure for the management of clinical trials  and integrated and consolidated r d operations in the madison facility  including work on the rondel sirna delivery system and calaa candidate  our suite of obesity metabolic disease compounds including the adipotide candidate  and the homing peptide discovery and development programs  these steps have created an integrated development operation that allows arrowhead to advance multiple programs simultaneously 
since our drug development strategy is unified around actively targeted delivery  our r d operations are synergistic across drug candidates and platforms 
additionally  arrowhead now has the infrastructure  expertise  ip portfolio  and management that we believe is necessary to attract and support a broad range of partnerships and research collaborations with large biopharma companies from discovery stage through clinical trials 
pipeline overview arrowhead is focused on delivering drugs preferentially to their site of action while avoiding non specific uptake in off target tissues 
our platform technologies are being developed to enable new therapeutic modalities through targeted delivery and enhanced pharmacokinetics 
in particular  our polymeric delivery systems  dynamic polyconjugates and rondel  have been formulated with small rnas to develop drug candidates to address diseases such as cancer and hbv through the mechanism of rnai 
the ability to deliver the fragile sirna molecules that induce rnai is the key enabler of this important new field of medicine 
our homing peptide platform is being used in a clinical obesity therapeutic study and in preclinical studies targeting cancer 
logo internal clinical programs arc hepatitis b virus infection according to the world health organization  million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis b virus  of which  to  people die each year from hbv related liver disease 
chronic hbv infection is defined by the presence of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag for more than months 
in the immune tolerant phase of chronic infection  which can last for many years  the infected person typically produces very high levels of viral dna and viral antigens 
however  the infection is not cytotoxic and the carrier may have no symptoms of illness 
over time  the ongoing production of viral antigens causes inflammation and necrosis  leading to elevation of liver enzymes such as alanine and aspartate transaminases  hepatitis  fibrosis  and liver cancer hcc 
if untreated  as many as to of chronic carriers develop cirrhosis or hcc 
antiviral therapy is prescribed when liver enzymes become elevated 
the current standard of care for treatment of chronic hbv infection is a daily oral dose of nucleotide nucleoside analogs nucs or a regimen of interferon injections to times weekly for approximately one year 
nucs are generally well tolerated  but patients may need lifetime treatment because viral replication often rebounds upon cessation of treatment 
interferon therapeutics can result in a functional cure in up to of some patient types  but treatment is often associated with significant side effects  including severe flu like symptoms  marrow suppression  and autoimmune disorders 
we see the need for a next generation hbv treatment with fewer side effects  that eliminates the need for interferon based treatment  has a finite treatment period and an attractive dosing regimen  and one that can be used at earlier stages of disease 
we believe a novel therapeutic approach that can effectively treat or provide a functional cure development of patient antibodies against hbsag has the potential to take significant market share and may expand the available market to include patients that are currently untreated 
arc is an sirna therapeutic intended for delivery to the active site of infection using our proprietary dynamic polyconjugate dpc technology 
arc consists of two sirna duplexes  each conjugated to a cholesterol derivative to enhance liver delivery and cellular uptake 
we have designed arc to be co administered with an active excipient  a masked  hepatocyte targeted polymeric amine 
once the sirnas and the active excipient are taken up by the hepatocytes  the polymeric amines are unmasked in the endosome and disrupt the endosomal membrane  releasing the sirna to the cytoplasm where it can engage the rnai machinery of the cell 
the sirnas in arc are designed to target multiple components of hbv production including the pregenomic rna that would be reverse transcribed to generate the viral dna 
the sirnas in arc target the mrnas that produce hbsag proteins  the viral polymerase  the core protein that forms the capsid  and the hbeag 
a reduction of viral antigens is considered necessary to effective therapy because the presence of viral proteins is thought to be a major contributor to the persistence of liver disease secondary to hbv infection 
efficacy data in mouse models of hbv infection show that arc is capable of reducing hbsag by greater than log  hbv dna by approximately log  and hbeag to the limit of detection 
pharmacologic effects persist for approximately one month after a single dose of arc safety data in rodents and non human primates indicate an acceptable safety margin 
we are currently conducting ind enabling studies with a goal to enter a phase clinical study in adipotide formerly prohibitin tp obesity and metabolic disorders obesity is a global health threat and one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the united states 
arrowhead s anti obesity drug candidate  adipotide  was designed to selectively disrupt the blood supply that supports unhealthy fat by the targeted induction of apoptosis cell death in the vasculature of adipose tissue 
the adipotide peptide consists of two functional domains 
the homing domain targets a membrane associated protein  prohibitin  on adipose vascular endothelial cells 
the membrane disrupting domain causes apoptosis by disrupting mitochondrial membranes inside the cells 
an investigational new drug application ind for adipotide was filed with the fda  and we began enrolling patients in as part of a phase clinical trial to test the safety of the compound in human patients 
our collaborator  md anderson cancer center in houston  plans to enroll up to obese prostate cancer patients in the phase study and has agreed to bear all direct costs of this trial 
up to five dose levels of the drug candidate will be tested in the trial 
three participants will be enrolled at each dose level  with the first group of participants receiving the lowest dose level by injection under the skin once per day for days and each new group receiving a higher dose than the group before it  if no intolerable side effects are seen 
this will continue until the highest tolerable dose is found or the study terminates 
potential advantages of adipotide shown to promote weight loss of to of total body mass in preclinical studies using rodents and spontaneously obese rhesus monkeys after just days of treatment  shown to reduce abnormalities in blood chemistry associated with diabetes  novel mechanism of action compared to other known therapeutics on the market or in clinical trials  no modulation of neurotransmitters seen in pre clinical studies  thus unlikely to have psychological side effects  no amphetamine like mechanism of action and thus unlikely to yield gi side effects 
adipotide is based on arrowhead s homing peptide library developed at md anderson cancer center 
white adipose fat tissue is highly vascularized and both the expansion and maintenance of adipose tissue depend on a continued ability to build supporting vasculature 
this peptide targeting library provides a map of the unique cell receptors on the vasculature that varies in different tissues 
targeting vasculature based on this variation allows for specific delivery of drug payloads to specific target cells  while avoiding collateral injury to other healthy non targeted cells 
using this technique  peptide sequences that target receptors specific to white adipose tissue were identified 
adipotide has been developed by our majority owned subsidiary  ablaris therapeutics  inc ablaris 
arrowhead owns of the fully diluted shares of ablaris 
calaa solid tumors calaa is a combination of our rondel delivery technology and a patented sirna targeting the m subunit of ribonucleotide reductase  a clinically validated cancer target 
ribonucleotide reductase catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleosides to deoxyribonucleosides and is necessary for dna synthesis and replication  and thus tumor growth 
the internally developed sirna demonstrates potent anti proliferative activity across multiple types of cancer cells 
calaa was the first sirna therapeutic candidate to target cancer in a human clinical study and we believe was also the first successful systemic delivery of an sirna therapeutic candidate 
in august enrollment into the phase clinical trial was completed 
adverse events observed coincided with an increase in certain cytokine levels 
elevation in cytokines is consistent with an acute immune response to the natural sirna used in calaa these reactions also appeared to be transient  such that if a patient stayed on calaa  the cytokine responses often subsided 
based on these results  a phase b trial was initiated using a modified dosing schedule in which patients were pretreated with a lower dose to assess whether this strategy can increase patient safety and further increase the maximum tolerated dose 
patient enrollment was completed in august and analysis of final study data is being prepared 
interim clinical results were presented at the american society of clinical oncology meeting asco 
data from patients accrued to dose levels     mg m showed that treatment related adverse events were mostly mild to moderate with fatigue  fever chills  allergic  or gastrointestinal related adverse events most frequently observed 
importantly  no changes in coagulation  liver function tests  or kidney function were observed 
analysis of tumor biopsies from three melanoma patients showed the presence of intracellular nanoparticles in amounts that correlated with dose 
additionally  a reduction was found in both the rrm messenger rna and protein levels when compared to pre dosing tissue 
furthermore  the presence of sirna mediated mrna cleavage products was confirmed by race  demonstrating that sirna mediated mrna cleavage occurred specifically at the site predicted for an rnai mechanism 
these results were published in march in the scientific journal nature  citing these interim data from our phase trial as the first evidence of systemic delivery of sirna  and the successful silencing of a widely recognized cancer gene via rna interference in humans 
partnered programs cyclosert and crlx formerly it the linear cyclodextrin based drug delivery platform  cyclosert  was designed for the delivery of small molecule drugs 
in december  we completed a phase trial with it  a conjugate of the linear cyclodextrin polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer drug  with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
in june  we entered into a transaction with cerulean pharmaceuticals  inc  a privately held boston  massachusetts based company 
cerulean licensed rights to further research and commercialize it now known as crlx  and the cyclosert platform for all products except for nucleic acids  tubulysin  cytolysin and second generation epothilones 
in connection with the transaction  we assigned certain patents to cerulean and cerulean granted back to us rights necessary to research and commercialize the excluded products 
as such  we retain the rights to the rondel sirna delivery platform  as well as calaa we received an initial payment of million  and may receive development and sales milestones  and royalty payments if crlx or other products based on the cyclosert platform are successfully developed 
should cerulean sublicense crlx to a third party  we are entitle to receive a percentage of any sublicensing income at rates between and  depending on the stage of the drug s development at the time of sublicensing 
tubulin inhibitor arrowhead has a license and joint development agreement with vienna  austria based biotech tube pharmaceuticals gmbh  which grants tube pharma the right to develop cyclosert enabled tubulin inhibitors 
tubulysins are a novel tubulin targeted class of natural compounds with potent anti proliferative activity against multiple cancer types 
tube pharma is conducting preclinical studies 
arrowhead is eligible to receive milestones and royalties on sales 
alnylam pharmaceuticals in january  arrowhead granted alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc  alnylam a license to utilize the dynamic polyconjugate delivery technology for a single rnai therapeutic product 
alnylam is collaborating with arrowhead to develop this technology for an undisclosed target in its alnylam x pipeline  which is focused on genetically defined targets and diseases 
arrowhead is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on sales from alnylam 
shire in december  arrowhead signed a research collaboration and license agreement with shire ag to develop and commercialize targeted peptide drug conjugates pdcs utilizing arrowhead s human derived homing peptide platform and shire s therapeutic payloads 
arrowhead may receive research funding and could be eligible for development  regulatory  and commercialization milestone payments of up to million for each development candidate  plus additional milestone payments for a second indication  and royalties on worldwide sales 
preclinical programs in addition to our clinical candidates and our partner based programs  we are actively engaged in the discovery and development of additional pre clinical stage products 
we focus on disease targets that are well suited for intervention with guided therapeutics like our pdcs and targeted rnai therapeutics using our dpc delivery platform 
these may include liver disease  oncology  and other therapeutic areas 
rnai delivery program in october  arrowhead acquired roche s rnai business  including its rna therapeutic assets  related intellectual property and research facility in madison  wisconsin 
we believe that these assets position arrowhead as one of the most advanced and broadest rnai therapeutics companies in the world 
arrowhead now possesses the following sirna assets non exclusive license from alnylam to use canonical sirnas in oncology  respiratory diseases  metabolic diseases and certain liver diseases 
this includes a sub license from isis pharmaceuticals giving arrowhead license for sirna chemical modifications for these specific disease areas 
non exclusive license from city of hope comprehensive cancer center to dicer substrate and meroduplex sirnas 
the dicer technology may provide advantages over canonical sirnas in certain circumstances 
in addition  different sirna formats may trigger rnai more or less efficiently on a target by target basis 
patent estate covering the dynamic polyconjugate sirna delivery system 
access to certain patents on targeting sirna drugs with antibodies and small molecules 
state of the art laboratory facilities in madison  wisconsin  managed by long term leaders in oligonucleotide therapeutics and delivery  including a small animal research facility and an offsite primate colony 
intellectual property covering roche s internally developed liposomal nanoparticle drug delivery technology 
rondel sirna delivery system which has demonstrated gene knockdown in humans in the calaa clinical trial 
minority ownership position in leonardo biosystems  inc  a private company developing a multi stage silicon based delivery system 
calaa phase oncology drug candidate 
we believe this represents one of the broadest sirna drug technology and delivery portfolios in the world 
rna interference the benefits of sirna therapeutics rna interference rnai is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene  thereby affecting the production of a specific protein 
deemed to be one of the most important recent discoveries in life science with the potential to transform medicine  the discoverers of rnai were awarded a nobel prize in for their work 
mediated by small interfering rnas sirna  a class of ribonucleic acid rna molecules  nucleotides in length  rnai based therapeutics can leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to potentially target and shut down specific disease causing genes 
small molecule and antibody drugs have proven effective at inhibiting certain cell surface  intracellular  and extracellular targets 
however  certain drug targets such as intranuclear genes and some proteins have proven difficult to inhibit with traditional drug based and biologic therapeutics 
developing effective drugs for these targets would have the potential to address large underserved markets for the treatment of many diseases 
using the ability to specifically silence any gene  sirna therapeutics may be able to address previously undruggable targets  unlocking the market potential of such targets 
mechanism of rna interference logo advantages of rnai as a therapeutic modality silences the expression of disease causing genes  potential to address any target in the transcriptome including previously undruggable targets  rapid lead identification  high specificity  opportunity to use multiple rna sequences in one drug product for synergistic silencing of related targets  and sirnas are uniquely suited for personalized medicine through target and cell specific delivery and knockdown 
addressing the sirna delivery challenge to date  the primary challenge to the development of sirna therapeutics has been delivering the fragile  often immunogenic and otherwise rapidly cleared sirna molecules  into the cytoplasm of the cell  where rnai activity occurs 
this hurdle has prevented sirna therapeutics from reaching full potential 
many companies have attempted to overcome the delivery challenge 
most early systems involved cholesterol conjugates or liposomes 
however  development in humans has been limited due to toxicity and immunogenicity of these approaches when studied in clinical trials 
to address the delivery challenge  arrowhead has a leading team of researchers with extensive sirna therapeutic know how and two validated delivery platforms the dynamic polyconjugate system is an amphipathic polymer to which shielding agents and targeting ligands are reversibly attached 
the rondel tm delivery system utilizes targeted cyclodextrin polymers to deliver sirna and other oligonucleotides to tumors 
human in vivo gene knockdown has been demonstrated in a phase cancer trial  establishing human proof of concept for the rondel system 
these are both modular systems that may be optimized on a target by target basis 
importantly  they also may be targeted to address a variety of tissues 
the dynamic polyconjugate sirna delivery system the dpc delivery system represents an innovative solution to the sirna delivery problem  specifically designed to overcome barriers to systemic administration of sirna 
developed by our scientists in madison  wisconsin  the inspiration for dpc technology came from the physical characteristics of viruses  nature s own nanoparticles for nucleic acid delivery 
viruses are efficient at finding their target cells and delivering their nucleic acid payload to the proper cellular compartment 
key features of viruses are their small size  their overall negative surface charge  their specificity for particular cell types based on receptors unique to that cell  and their ability to disassemble and release their nucleic acid cargo to the proper cell compartment in response to cellular triggers 
all of these features are incorporated into dpc technology 
dpcs are small nanoparticles  nanometers nm in size  with an amphipathic polymer backbone 
arrowhead has a library of polymers that may be employed with the system  enabling optimization based on factors such as preferred mode of administration  pharmacokinetics  and target tissue 
shielding agents such as polyethylene glycol and targeting ligands are reversibly attached to the polymer backbone 
in some constructs  the sirna payload is attached to the dpc  while in other constructs  the sirna circulates attached to a different carrier 
when attached  the dpc construct protects the sirna payload while allowing the polymer to circulate in the blood without creating undue toxicity 
the targeting ligand guides the nanoparticles to the cell of interest where  together with the sirna  it is taken up into a membrane enclosed cellular compartment known as an endosome 
the polymer is selected for its ability to disrupt the endosomal membrane which releases the sirna into the cytoplasm 
there  it engages the cell s rnai machinery  ultimately resulting in knockdown of target gene expression 
this lytic chemistry of the dpc polymeric backbone is modified  or masked  using proprietary chemistry 
masking of the polymer s lytic chemistry accomplishes two interrelated objectives that are critical to in vivo sirna delivery reduction of toxicity by controlling when the membrane lytic property of the polymer is activated 
inhibition of non specific interactions with blood components and non targeted cell types 
logo arrowhead has developed multiple forms of the prototypical dpc delivery system 
our arc clinical candidate utilizes a formulation where the sirna is conjugated to cholesterol and is not attached to the dpc 
pre clinical studies have shown co injection of liver targeted dpc polymer together with sirna conjugated to a lipophilic moiety  such as cholesterol  results in a fold increase in the potency when compared to the sirna cholesterol alone 
this formulation retains the potent endosomal escape capabilities of arrowhead s dpc platform  simplifies drug manufacturing  and creates new targeting opportunities 
dpcs using co injection strategy logo a dpc formulation for subcutaneous administration has also been developed using arrowhead s latest proprietary polymer masking technology 
using dpcs to deliver sirna  high level target gene knockdown is observed at low sirna doses with limited toxicity in rodents and non human primates 
arrowhead studies have shown knockdown of in monkeys after a single injection of mg kg  at mg kg  and in mice at mg kg  which represents greater knockdown at lower doses than reported results of other clinical candidates 
pk and biodistribution studies indicate that the new masking technology is highly stable  allowing for maximal bioavailability and long circulation times 
arrowhead is developing this formulation for use in multiple therapeutic areas including oncology 
rondel delivery system for this delivery system  polymers form the foundation for a three part rnai oligonucleotide nanoparticle delivery rondel technology 
the first component is the positively charged polymer that  when mixed with sirna  binds to the negatively charged backbone of the sirna 
the polymer and sirna self assemble into nanoparticles less than nm diameter that are designed to protect the sirna from nuclease degradation in serum 
the cyclodextrin in the polymer enables the surface of the particles to be decorated by stabilizing agents and targeting ligands 
these surface modifications are formed by proprietary methods involving the cyclodextrins 
the surface modifying agents have terminal adamantane groups that form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin and contain polyethylene glycol peg to endow the particles with properties that prevent aggregation  enhance stability and enable systemic administration 
targeting molecules can be covalently attached to the adamantane peg modifier  enabling the sirna containing particles to be targeted to tissues of interest 
rondel nanoparticle logo based on a novel polymeric sugar linear cyclodextrin molecule  rondel has been applied thus far to the delivery of two classes of therapeutics sirna and small molecule drugs 
the polymer is combined with the drug molecule to form a drug containing nanoparticle between nanometers and nanometers in size 
we believe that this particle size is important because drug molecules below nanometers are quickly cleared from the body in the urine while nanoparticles larger than nanometers are not always able to escape the tumor vasculature to reach tumor cells 
nanoparticles between and nanometers can lead to preferential accumulation in tumor tissue  where the drug can take effect  leaving other tissues less affected 
the drug delivery system has the added benefits of increasing solubility and allowing targeting of the nanoparticles 
the rondel delivery system offers the following advantages generalized delivery system binds to and self assembles with the sirna to form uniform colloidal sized particles 
analysis has shown that these particles are spherical and between nm and nm in diameter 
any sirna sequence can be easily substituted because rondel binds to the sirna backbone  other sirnas sequences can be easily incorporated to form a new drug product 
safety the rondel technology has been shown to have a positive safety profile in vitro testing with human cell cultures  and the fully formulated polymer sirna particles exhibit a significant therapeutic window of safety in animals  even when repeated doses up to eight doses over a four week period are used 
effective targeted delivery we have demonstrated successful delivery of functional sirna therapeutics to tumor cells and to hepatocytes by systemic administration and confirmed sequence specific gene inhibition 
human proof of concept calaa  the first clinical candidate developed using the rondel system  has established several important firsts in human testing of an sirna therapeutic including first to show systemic sirna delivery  first to show dose dependent accumulation in target cells and first to show rnai mediated mrna and protein knockdown 
calaa and rondel have been developed by arrowhead s majority owned subsidiary  calando pharmaceuticals  inc calando 
arrowhead owns of the fully diluted shares of calando 
homing peptide program in april  arrowhead acquired alvos therapeutics  inc alvos 
alvos licensed a discovery platform and large library of proprietary human derived homing peptides from the md anderson cancer center 
this discovery platform is designed to identify targeting agents  such as peptides  that selectively accumulate in primary and metastatic tumors  associated vasculature  and to healthy tissue types 
such targeting agents are of interest for drug development because they hold the promise of shepherding drugs into specific cells while sparing others 
this new platform was acquired because it fit well into our existing business 
one of the key advantages of our rna delivery systems is their ability to be targeted 
with a vast proprietary targeting library of our own  we believe that we can enhance the value of our rnai programs and differentiate our capabilities from those of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that we can apply the homing peptide sequences to non rna therapeutics and present attractive value to potential partners 
the platform has the potential to allow arrowhead to develop therapeutic agents that hunt down and destroy known tumors  as well as distant unidentified metastases  convert cancer therapeutics that generally interact with most cells in the body to smart drugs that accumulate primarily at tumor sites and affect cancer cells preferentially  thereby improving the toxicity and side effects of currently used cancer drugs  and selectively target non cancer therapeutics to virtually any tissue type in the body where they can have the desired pharmacologic effect 
this platform is potentially powerful in the specificity of the targeting sequences  the large number of unique sequences and their origin from human screening 
in addition  because of the human based identification process  there is lower risk that animal model data will not translate 
our proprietary library of  unique targeting sequences can be used with our own delivery platforms  as well as with small molecule drugs 
this platform has achieved clinical proof of concept in targeting metastatic prostate cancer with the first sequence tested in humans 
drs 
renata pasqualini and wadih arap  who developed this technology  run a large laboratory at md anderson cancer center 
they focus on discovering novel cell surface receptors and validated receptors on tumor sites and identifying peptide sequences that will bind to those receptors 
importantly  their method identifies peptides that are rapidly internalized into cells 
these peptide receptor pairs hold the promise of shuttling therapeutic payloads preferentially and directly into those cells 
the ability to target and deliver cytotoxins would address some of the problems with current cancer therapeutics by limiting side effects and increasing efficacy 
in order to discover these receptors and sequences that target them  drs 
pasqualini and arap used a technique called in vivo phage display 
over the past several years they have applied phage display screening to end stage cancer patients with primary and metastatic tumors under rigorous ethical standards 
to our knowledge  they are the only group in the world that is generating this type of human derived data 
direct screening in human cancer patients has the potential to eliminate some of the uncertainty that has plagued current discovery methods with animal models 
this strategy sought to map the human vasculature into zip codes and has discovered a large number of novel receptors that are expressed only on the cell surface of tumor sites and nowhere else 
the library can be further increased by continuing to work with md anderson to screen additional patients 
arrowhead is working to apply this technology to targeting our proprietary sirna delivery vehicles 
our two primary delivery platforms  dpcs and rondel  are highly attractive in part because they have been shown to be well tolerated  effective  capable of delivering rnas to multiple organ systems  and they are targetable 
the homing peptide library provides our targeted therapeutic program with a powerful new source of flexibility 
the library is also valuable in creating a new class of therapeutics  peptide drug conjugates  or pdcs 
by linking the homing peptides to traditional small molecule drugs we can potentially transform a therapeutic that interacts with most cells in the body into one that interacts preferentially with the cell of choice 
we believe that this transition from untargeted to targeted drugs is a paradigm shift for cancer therapeutics and that our new library puts us at the forefront of this transformation 
we intend to build our own pipeline and work with partners to apply our targeting sequences to their drugs 
we believe that this specific targeting will enable us to make existing generics safer and more effective and we intend to work with partners to help make their proprietary drugs better 
given the large number of approved apis for oncology and the thousands of homing peptide sequences that we now have  there are many potential combinations of targeting sequence and drug molecules 
pdcs share the promise of the original class of guided therapeutics  antibody drug conjugates or adcs  in that they could increase efficacy and decrease toxicity relative to current standard of care oncology products 
benefits of pdcs as a class are as follows they are potentially faster  cheaper  and simpler to make than adcs  making them attractive development projects for biopharmaceutical companies  their targets are expressed on a high percentage of multiple tumor types  giving them a larger potential commercial market than genetically targeted agents that are efficacious in only a small subset of patient populations  and the use of homing peptides that were discovered in human cancer patients as the targeting moieties for pdcs potentially increases clinical probability of success 
we believe this unique mix of benefits will be attractive to potential partners in the biopharmaceutical industry 
this technology has the potential to facilitate the rapid development of multiple new product candidates  each of which could meet a critical unmet medical need 
in addition  screening in man has broad applicability in other therapeutic areas of interest to the biopharmaceutical industry

license agreements cerulean license the linear cyclodextrin based drug delivery platform  cyclosert  was designed for the delivery of small molecule drugs 
cyclosert provides many of the same benefits as the rondel system 
in december  we completed a phase trial with it  a conjugate of calando s linear cyclodextrin polymer and camptothecin  a potent anti cancer drug  with a positive safety profile and indications of efficacy 
on june   we entered into a transaction with cerulean related to cyclosert and it the cerulean transaction 
in the cerulean transaction  we granted cerulean an irrevocable  perpetual  royalty bearing worldwide license with the right to sublicense  under certain patent rights and know how in the field of human diseases solely in order to a conduct research and development on the linear cyclodextrin system  including making improvements thereto  in order to research and commercialize our clinical asset it now known as crlx  as well as certain other products in which no therapeutic agent is specifically defined the cerulean products  b research  develop  make  have made  use  market  offer to sell  distribute  sell and import crlx and cerulean products  and c use  copy  modify and distribute certain know how for those purposes 
we retained all rights with respect to products in which a therapeutic agent is a i tubulysin  ii cytolysin  iii second generation epothilone or iv nucleic acid hereinafter calando products 
the cerulean transaction also involved the sale and assignment by us of certain patents directed to cyclosert and crlx the cerulean assigned patents to cerulean 
cerulean then granted back to us an exclusive  irrevocable  perpetual  royalty free  worldwide license  with the right to grant sublicenses  under the cerulean assigned patents solely to the extent necessary to research and commercialize products in which each therapeutic agent is a cytolysin  tubulysin  second generation epothilone or any nucleic acid 
as such  we retain the rights to the rondel sirna delivery platform  as well as the sirna based products  calaa and calaa the cerulean transaction resulted in an initial payment to calando of million 
cerulean is obligated to pay development milestone payments of up to million if crlx progresses through clinical trials and receives marketing approval 
if approved  we are also entitled to receive up to an additional million in sales milestone payments  plus single digit royalties on net sales 
should cerulean sublicense crlx to a third party  we shall receive a percentage of any sublicensing income at rates between and  depending on the stage of the drug s development at the time of sublicensing 
cerulean is obligated to further pay development milestone payments of up to million for each cerulean product that progresses through clinical trials and receives marketing approval 
if cerulean products are approved  we are entitled to receive up to an additional million in sales milestone payments  plus single digit royalties on net sales 
should cerulean sublicense a cerulean product to a third party  we shall receive a percentage of any sublicensing income at a rate in the tens 
the terms of the agreements of the cerulean transactions are tied to the expiration of certain controlled patent rights and cerulean assigned patents 
cerulean may terminate the agreements on thirty days notice and unless there is a drug safety concern  would be obligated to re assign the crlx ind back to us and provide us with an exclusive license thereto under the cerulean assigned patents 
we are responsible for the costs associated with prosecution of the patents we control and have licensed to cerulean 
university of texas md anderson cancer center license in december  we obtained an exclusive world wide license from at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston  texas utmdacc related to adipotide technology the utmdacc license 
the utmdacc license granted us a royalty bearing  exclusive right with the right to sublicense under certain utmdacc patents to develop and commercialize certain products in the fields of therapeutics  diagnostics and research services that both i incorporate peptides that specifically target adipose tissue  and ii are used to treat  diagnose or research solely either a obesity  overweight and or b metabolic conditions related to  caused by and or associated with obesity and overweight  eg  diabetes  and cancer therapies  diagnostics and research products associated with a specific targeting moiety 
we also have rights to certain improvements to the utmdacc technology arising in the lab of drs 
wadih arap and renata pasqualini utmdacc improvements 
in consideration for the license  we paid utmdacc an upfront fee of million and are obligated to pay annual fees initially equal to  increasing up to a maximum of  with such annual fees creditable against milestone payments 
we may be obligated to pay development milestone payments of up to million for each utmdcc licensed product that progresses through clinical trials and receives us marketing approval are required 
additional eu and japanese approval milestone payments are in the low single digit million dollar range 
if a commercial drug is developed and approved  royalty payments on net sales of utmdacc licensed products are in the low single digit range 
should we sublicense or partner a utmdacc licensed product  utmdacc would receive partnering fee percentages in the range of single digits to the twenties  depending on the stage of development of the partnered utmdacc licensed product 
the term of the utmdacc license is linked to the last to expire patents licensed therein or years if a licensed product contains only licensed know how 
we are obligated to actively and effectively attempt to commercialize the utmdacc technology and submit to utmdacc a phase clinical trial protocol within two years of obtaining an approved ind 
we are also obligated to commence a phase clinical trial within four years and a phase clinical trial within seven years of approval of an ind 
however  we may obtain yearly extensions of time upon the payment of an increasing fee in the range of tens of thousands of dollars up to several hundred thousand dollars 
we also have diligence obligations with respect to any utmdacc improvements later added to the license 
the utmdacc license shall automatically terminate if we file for bankruptcy or are unable to pay our bills as they come due 
research and development facility arrowhead operates a research and development facility in madison  wisconsin 
this facility was built and equipped by roche and was part of our acquisition of their rna therapeutics business

research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred in identifying  developing and testing our product programs 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  license fees  consulting fees  contract research and manufacturing  and the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities 
research and development expense for was million an increase from million in  primarily due to expenses related to the acquisition of the madison facility 
government regulation governmental authorities in the us and other countries extensively regulate the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing  among other things  of drugs and biologic products 
all of our foreseeable product candidates are expected to be regulated as drug products 
in the us  the fda regulates drug products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdca  and other laws within the public health service act 
failure to comply with applicable us requirements  both before and after approval  may lead to administrative and judicial sanctions  such as a delay in approving or refusal by the fda to approve pending applications  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  and or criminal prosecutions 
before drug products are marketed they must be approved by the fda 
the steps required before a novel drug product is approved by the fda include pre clinical laboratory  animal  and formulation tests  submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application ind for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product for each indication for which approval is sought  submission to the fda of a new drug application nda  satisfactory completion of a fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product is produced to assess compliance with cgmp  and fda review and finally approval of an nda 
pre clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry  toxicity and formulation  as well as animal studies 
the results of the pre clinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
an ind will automatically become effective days after receipt by the fda  unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions  such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the ind 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding fda concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed 
there can be no assurance that submission of an ind will result in fda authorization to commence clinical trials 
once an ind is in effect  each clinical trial to be conducted under the ind must be submitted to the fda  which may or may not allow the trial to proceed 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified physician investigators and healthcare personnel 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three defined phases  but the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase usually involves the initial administration of the investigational drug or biologic product to healthy individuals to evaluate its safety  dosage tolerance and pharmacodynamics 
phase usually involves trials in a limited patient population  with the disease or condition for which the test material is being developed  to evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage  identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks  and preliminarily evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for specific indications 
phase trials usually further evaluate effectiveness and test further for safety by administering the drug or biologic candidate in its final form in an expanded patient population 
our product development partners  the fda  or we may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including any situation where we believe that patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or are obtaining no medical benefit from the test material 
assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing  the results of the pre clinical trials and the clinical trials  together with other detailed information  including information on the manufacture and composition of the product  are submitted to the fda in the form of an nda requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications 
before approving an application  the fda will usually inspect the facilities where the product is manufactured  and will not approve the product unless cgmp compliance is satisfactory 
if the fda determines the nda is not acceptable  the fda may outline the deficiencies in the nda and often will request additional information 
if the fda approves the nda  certain changes to the approved product  such as adding new indications  manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims are subject to further fda review and approval 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and approval on a timely basis  if at all  cannot be guaranteed 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states  or more than  individuals in the us and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the us a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the us for that drug 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity  which means that the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication  except in very limited circumstances  for seven years 
in addition  regardless of the type of approval  we and our partners are required to comply with a number of fda requirements both before and after approval 
for example  drug makers are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems  if any  to the fda  and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products 
in addition  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval  and the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance  including production and quality control to comply with cgmp 
in addition  discovery of problems  such as safety problems  may result in changes in labeling or restrictions on a product manufacturer or nda holder  including removal of the product from the market

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks discussed below and all of the other information contained in this report in evaluating us and an investment in our securities 
if any of the following risks and uncertainties should occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
additionally  we note that we are a development stage company and we have accrued net losses annually since inception 
we urge you to consider our likelihood of success and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by entities at similar stages of development 
risks related to our financial condition our independent auditors have issued a report questioning our ability to continue as a going concern 
the report of our independent auditors contained in our financial statements explains that we have not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover operating costs and allow us to continue as a going concern 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until we become profitable 
if we are unable to obtain adequate capital  we may have to delay  scale back  or discontinue the development and or commercialization of one or more product candidates  or relinquish or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies  product candidates  or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves and or cease operations 
we have a history of net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception  including net losses of million for the year ended september  and a cumulative net loss since inception of approximately million 
we expect that our operating losses will continue as we fund our drug development and discovery efforts 
to achieve profitability  we must  either directly or through licensing and or partnering relationships  successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for a drug candidate and effectively manufacture  market and sell any drugs we successfully develop 
even if we successfully commercialize drug candidates that receive regulatory approval  we may not be able to realize revenues at a level that would allow us to achieve or sustain profitability 
accordingly  we may never generate significant revenue and  even if we do generate significant revenue  we may never achieve profitability 
we have limited cash resources 
our business currently does not generate the cash that is necessary to finance our operations 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in and million since our inception 
subject to the success of the research and development programs of our company and our partners  and potential licensing or partnering transactions  we will need to raise significant additional capital in the immediate future to fund research and development activities relating to our development of our product candidates  including clinical and pre clinical trials  fund our general and administrative activities  pursue licensing opportunities for our technologies  protect our intellectual property  and retain our management and technical staff 
our future capital needs depend on many factors  including the scope  duration and expenditures associated with our research and development  continued scientific progress in these programs  the outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions  if any  competing technological developments  our proprietary patent position  if any  in our products  and the regulatory approval process for our products 
we will need to raise substantial additional funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements in the immediate future to continue our operations 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
general market conditions  as well as market conditions for companies that are facing financial distress  may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets  and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our stockholders will result  which may substantially dilute the value of your investment 
in addition  as a condition to providing additional funds to us  future investors may demand  and may be granted  rights superior to those of existing stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities and  in the event of insolvency  would be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of corporate assets 
we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us  in order to raise additional funds through alliance  joint venture or licensing arrangements 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to further delay  reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities 
these actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock 
the current financial market conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
we do not yet generate substantial revenue  and our operations and research and development activities have been primarily funded to date through the sale of company securities and securities of our subsidiaries 
the global financial markets are volatile and those market conditions may impair our ability to raise the capital we require 
if we are unable to secure additional cash resources from the sale of securities or other sources  it could become necessary to slow or suspend development efforts 
in addition  we may have to reduce expenses  which could impair our ability to manage our business 
even if investment capital is available to us  the terms may be onerous 
because we have not generated significant revenues to cover our operating expenses  we are dependent on raising additional capital from investors or lenders 
to date  we have only generated a small amount of revenue 
given our strategy of financing new and unproven technology research  there can be no assurance we will ever generate significant revenue 
our revenue producing opportunities depend on our ability to attract collaborations or out licenses with other companies  receive milestone and royalty payments from prior divestitures  and or generate income from the sales of products 
these sources of revenue are uncertain as to the amount and timing of potential revenue 
accordingly  our revenue prospects are uncertain and we must plan to finance our operations through the sales of equity securities or debt financing 
if we are unable to continue raising operating capital from these sources  we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations 
we will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our applications to generate revenues and achieve profitability 
even if our research and development efforts yield technologically feasible applications  we may not successfully develop commercial products which would take years to study in human clinical trials prior to regulatory approval  and  even if successfully developed  we may not do so on a timely basis 
during this development period  superior competitive technologies may be introduced which could diminish or extinguish the potential commercial uses for our drug candidates 
additionally  the degree to which patients and consumers will adopt any product we develop is uncertain 
we cannot predict whether significant commercial market acceptance for our products  if approved  will ever develop  and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market 
our revenue growth and achievement of profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce new technological applications to manufacturers for products accepted by customers 
if we are unable to cost effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among the medical establishment and patients  or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
we have debt on our consolidated balance sheet through our subsidiary  calando  which could have negative consequences if we were unable to repay the principal or interest due 
calando has a  unsecured convertible promissory note outstanding 
the note bears interest accrued annually  and matures in november the note is payable at two times face value at maturity and upon the occurrence of certain events  including  the license of calando s sirna delivery system 
if calando is unable to meet its obligations to the bearer of the note  arrowhead may not be in a position to lend calando sufficient cash to pay such demand note 
unless other sources of financing become available  this could result in calando s insolvency 
our subsidiaries are party to technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective and  if these agreements are terminated  our technology and our business would be seriously and adversely affected 
through our subsidiaries  we are party into exclusive  long term license agreements with university of texas md anderson cancer center  california institute of technology  alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc and other entities to incorporate their proprietary technologies into our proposed products 
these license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions  including conditions in some cases related to the commercialization of the licensed technology 
we may not be able to successfully incorporate these technologies into marketable products or  if we do  whether sales will be sufficient to recover the amounts that we are obligated to pay to the licensors 
if we fail to satisfy our obligations under these agreements the terms of the licenses may be materially modified  such as by rendering the licenses non exclusive  or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us  which would limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition 
risks related to our company drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
we are focused on technology related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates 
product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development  such as in animal and early human clinical trials  often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons  such as clinical trial results may be unacceptable  even though preclinical trial results were promising  inefficacy and or harmful side effects in humans or animals  the necessary regulatory bodies  such as the us food and drug administration  may not approve our potential product for the intended use  and manufacturing and distribution may be uneconomical 
for example  the positive pre clinical results for adipotide in animals may not be replicated in human clinical studies or it may be found to be unsafe in humans 
additionally  clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists  medical personnel  regulatory personnel  statisticians and others  which often delays  limits  or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products 
clinical trials can take many years to complete  including the process of study design  clinical site selection and the enrollment of patients 
as a result  we can experience significant delays in completing clinical studies  which can increase the cost of developing a drug candidate 
if our drug candidates are not successful in human clinical trials  we may be forced to curtail or abandon certain development programs 
if we experience significant delays in commencing or completing our clinical studies  we could suffer from significant cost overruns  which could negatively affect our capital resources and our ability to complete these studies 
we may be unable to attract revenue generating collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to advance our drug candidates 
our business strategy includes obtaining collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to support the development of our therapeutic sirna and other drug candidates 
we may not be able to attract such partners  and even if we are able to enter into such partnerships  the terms may be less favorable than anticipated 
further  entering into partnership agreements may limit our commercialization options and or require us to share revenues and profits with our partners 
our products are in the early stages of our development and because we have a short development history with both dpcs and homing peptides  there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects 
we have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any products 
we have only a limited history upon which one can evaluate our targeted therapeutic business and prospects as our therapeutic products are still at an early stage of development 
thus  we have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields  particularly in the biopharmaceutical area 
for example  to execute our business plan  we will need to successfully execute product development activities using an unproven technology  build  maintain and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio  gain acceptance for the development and commercialization of any product we develop  develop and maintain successful strategic relationships  and manage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses are expected to increase in the near term due to preclinical and clinical trials 
if we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives  we may not be able to develop products  raise capital  expand our business or continue our operations 
we may lose a considerable amount of control over our intellectual property and may not receive anticipated revenues in strategic transactions  particularly where the consideration is contingent on the achievement of development or sales milestones 
our business model has been to develop new technologies and to exploit the intellectual property created through the research and development process to develop commercially successful products 
calando has licensed a portion of its technology to cerulean pharma  inc and we intend to pursue licensing arrangements with other companies 
a significant portion of the potential value from these licenses is tied to the achievement of the development and sales milestones  which we cannot control 
similarly  the majority of the consideration  up to million  potentially payable by wisepower in connection with our sale of unidym is tied to the achievement of commercialization milestones  which we cannot control 
although wisepower and cerulean are required to use certain minimum efforts to achieve the post closing milestones  we cannot control whether they actually achieve these milestones 
if the acquirers fail to achieve performance milestones  we may not receive a significant portion of the total value of any sale  license or other strategic transaction 
there are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize new technological applications  and  as a result  we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use 
our research and development efforts involve therapeutics based on nanotechnology and rna interference  which are largely unproven technologies 
our scientists and engineers are working on developing technology in various stages 
however  such technology s commercial feasibility and acceptance are unknown 
scientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes a long time to reach commercial viability  if at all 
to date  our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable applications  and may never do so 
during the research and development process  we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome 
because of these uncertainties  it is possible that none of our potential applications will be successfully developed 
if we are unable to successfully develop applications of our technology for commercial use  we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business 
we will need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop and market our products 
we do not possess all of the financial and development resources necessary to develop and commercialize products that may result from our technologies on a mass scale 
unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing capability  we will need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize current and future products 
if we do not find appropriate partners  or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful  our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected 
even if we are able to find collaborative partners  the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and is beyond our control 
in addition  in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration  there are a variety of technical  business and legal risks  including a development partner would likely gain access to our proprietary information  potentially enabling the partner to develop products without us or design around our intellectual property  we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates or to their marketing and distribution  and disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research  development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management s resources 
the occurrence of any of the above events or other related events not foreseen by us could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to effectively secure first tier technologies when competing against other investors 
our success may require that we acquire new or complimentary technologies 
however  we compete with a substantial number of other companies that may also compete for technologies we desire 
in addition  many venture capital firms and other institutional investors  as well as other pharmaceutical and biotech companies  invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies 
many of these companies have greater financial  scientific and commercial resources than us 
therefore  we may not be able to secure the technologies we desire 
furthermore  should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful  there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and or technologies 
we rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products 
we rely on third parties for various components and processes for our products 
while we try to have at least two sources for each component and process  we may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source  other companies may choose not to work with us  or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist  or does not exist on acceptable terms 
there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third party contractors  suppliers or collaborators which is beyond our control 
if such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us  our business would be adversely affected 
therefore  it is possible that our business plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials  components and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost  if at all  or to get a timely response from vendors 
we must overcome the many obstacles associated with integrating and operating varying development programs 
our model to integrate and oversee research and development projects presents many risks  including the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel  and the diversion of our management s attention as a result of evaluating  negotiating and integrating acquisitions or new business ventures 
if we are unable to timely and efficiently design and integrate administrative and operational support for our subsidiaries  we may be unable to manage projects effectively  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our business objectives and the value of an investment in the company could decline 
in addition  consummating acquisitions and strategic relationships could adversely impact our cash position  and dilute stockholder interests  for many reasons  including collaboration terms that decrease future cash flows from products in exchange for near term benefits  changes to our income to reflect the amortization of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  interest costs and debt service requirements for any debt incurred to fund our growth strategy  and any issuance of securities to fund our operations or growth  which dilutes or lessens the rights of current stockholders 
our success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  including dr 
anzalone  our president and chief executive officer  dr 
bruce given  our chief operating officer  and ken myszkowski  our chief financial officer 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our executives 
our ability to execute our strategy also will depend on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists and management 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we could have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner  or at all 
members of our senior management team and board may have a conflict of interest in also serving as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries 
while we expect that our officers and directors who also serve as officers and or directors of our subsidiaries will comply with their fiduciary duties owed to our stockholders  they may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and the minority stockholders of our subsidiaries 
specifically  dr 
anzalone  our president and ceo  is the founder  ceo and a board member of nanotope  a regenerative medicine company in which the company owns a interest 
further  dr 
anzalone as well as dr 
mauro ferrari  an arrowhead board member  are board members of leonardo  a drug delivery company in which arrowhead owns a interest 
dr 
anzalone owns a noncontrolling interest in the stock of nanotope 
drs 
anzalone and ferrari own a noncontrolling interest in leonardo 
douglass given  a member of our board of directors  is the brother of bruce given 
to the extent that any of our directors choose to recuse themselves from particular board actions to avoid a conflict of interest  the other members of our board of directors will have a greater influence on such decisions 
we face uncertainty related to healthcare reform  pricing and reimbursement  which could reduce our revenue 
in the united states  president obama signed in march the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  ppaca  which is expected to substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers 
ppaca provides for changes to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage  encourages improvements in the quality of health care items and services  and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical industry in a number of ways  further listed below 
by extending coverage to a larger population  ppaca may substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services  drugs and devices 
these structural changes  as well as other changes that may be made as part of deficit and debt reduction efforts in congress  could entail modifications to the existing system of private payers and government programs  such as medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program  as well as the creation of a government sponsored healthcare insurance source  or some combination of both 
such restructuring of the coverage of medical care in the united states could impact the extent of reimbursement for prescribed drugs  including our product candidates  biopharmaceuticals  and medical devices 
some of the specific ppaca provisions  among other things establish annual  non deductible fees on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologics  beginning in  increase minimum medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program  extend manufacturers medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations  establish a new patient centered outcomes research institute to oversee  identify priorities in and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research  require manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program  under which they must agree to offer percent point of sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period  as a condition for the manufacturer s outpatient drugs to be covered under medicare part d  beginning in  and increase the number of entities eligible for discounts under the public health service pharmaceutical pricing program  effective january if future reimbursement for approved product candidates  if any  is substantially less than we project  or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased  our business could be materially and adversely impacted 
sales of any approved drug candidate will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third party payers such as government insurance programs  including medicare and medicaid  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations and other health care related organizations 
accordingly  coverage and reimbursement may be uncertain 
adoption of any drug candidate by the medical community may be limited if third party payers will not offer coverage 
cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any new drug and  in turn  the price that we will be able to charge 
we are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payers 
any denial of private or government payer coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm our business and reduce our revenue 
in addition  both the federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation affecting coverage and reimbursement policies  which are designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care  as well as hold public hearings on these matters  which has resulted in certain private companies dropping the prices of their drugs 
further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely  which could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity 
there may be future changes that result in reductions in current coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates  if approved and commercialized  and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations 
there may be a difference in the investment valuations that we used when making initial and subsequent investments in our subsidiaries and minority investments and actual market values 
our investments in our subsidiaries and noncontrolling interests were the result of negotiation with subsidiary management and equity holders  and the investment valuations may not always have been independently verified 
traditional methods used by independent valuation analysts include a discounted cash flow analysis and a comparable company analysis 
we have not generated a positive cash flow to date and do not expect to generate significant cash flow in the near future 
additionally  we believe that few comparable public companies exist to provide meaningful valuation comparisons 
accordingly  we have not always sought independent valuation analysis in connection with our investments and may have invested in our various holdings at higher or lower valuations than an independent source would have recommended 
there may be no correlation between the investment valuations that we used over the years for our investments and the actual market values 
if we should eventually sell all or a part of any of our consolidated business or that of a subsidiary  the ultimate sale price may be for a value substantially different than previously determined by us  which could materially and adversely impair the value of our common stock 
risks related to our intellectual property our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain  exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage 
we have licensed rights to pending patents and have filed and expect to continue to file patent applications 
researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we choose to license 
if a particular patent is not granted  the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished 
further  even if these patents are granted  they may be difficult to enforce 
even if successful  efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive  distracting for management  cause our patents to be invalidated  and frustrate commercialization of products 
additionally  even if patents are issued and are enforceable  others may independently develop similar  superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us  or our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others 
finally  patent prosecution is expensive  and we may be forced to curtail prosecution if our cash resources are limited 
thus  the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage 
if we are unable to derive value from our licensed or owned intellectual property  the value of your investment may decline 
we may be subject to patent infringement claims  which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products 
because the intellectual property landscape in the fields in which we participate is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary  it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third party rights 
however  we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that  if found to be valid and enforceable  could be alleged to render one or more of our business lines infringing 
if a claim should be brought and is successful  we may be required to pay substantial damages  be forced to abandon any affected business lines and or seek a license from the patent holder 
in addition  any patent infringement claims brought against us  whether or not successful  may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns 
these could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects 
we cannot be certain that patents owned or licensed by us or our subsidiaries will not be challenged by others 
in addition  if our potential products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers  and we may be required to indemnify our customers for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims 
the claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers  regardless of the merits of these claims 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use 
if we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  we may be unable to continue selling such products 
our technology licensed from various third parties may be subject to government rights and retained rights of the originating research institutions 
we license technology from the university of texas md anderson cancer center  caltech  and other universities and companies 
our licensors may have obligations to government agencies or universities 
under their agreements  a government agency or university may obtain certain rights over the technology that we have developed and licensed  including the right to require that a compulsory license be granted to one or more third parties selected by the government agency 
in addition  our licensors often retain certain rights under their agreements with us  including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use  to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology  and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology 
it is difficult to monitor whether our licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses  and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse 
risks related to regulation of our products our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulations 
our operations  including our research and development and our commercialization efforts  such as clinical trials  manufacturing and distribution  are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program  we cannot be assured that the company or our employees are  or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable federal and state regulations or laws 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations or laws  a range of actions could result  including  but not limited to  the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a commercialized product  significant fines  sanctions  or litigation  any of which could harm our business and financial condition 
risks related to our stock stockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in any additional financing 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of  shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  on such terms and at such prices as our board of directors may determine 
adjusted for the for stock split that was implemented on november   as of september   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
the issuance of additional securities in financing transactions by us or through the exercise of options or warrants will dilute the equity interests of our existing stockholders  perhaps substantially  and might result in dilution in the tangible net book value of a share of our common stock  depending upon the price and other terms on which the additional shares are issued 
our common stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future  without regard to our results of operations and prospects 
because we are a development stage company  there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured 
consequently  we expect that the market price of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate significantly 
we may not generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our technology for several years  if at all 
in the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance  we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as announcements of developments related to our business  our ability to enter into or extend investigation phase  development phase  commercialization phase and other agreements with new and or existing partners  announcements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products  market perception and or investor sentiment regarding our technology  announcements regarding developments in the rna interference or biotechnology fields in general  market perception and or announcements regarding other companies developing products in the field of rna interference  the issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights  and variations in our operating results 
we will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price 
as a result  our stock price may be volatile and such volatility could result in the loss of all or part of your investment 
additionally  in the past  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
the market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be very limited  and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  historically our securities have been relatively thinly traded 
investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of the stock 
for example  mandatory sales of our common stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our common stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines 
accordingly  it may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock 
unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock  sales of our stock could continue to result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock  our stock price and trading volume may decline 
the trading market for our common stock can be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business 
we do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by industry or securities analysts 
investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive coverage from analysts 
if no industry or securities analysts commence coverage of the company  the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted 
in the event we obtain industry or security analyst coverage  if one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects  our stock price may decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fails to publish reports about the company regularly  our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets  which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected by the sale of shares by our management or founding stockholders 
sales of our common stock by our officers  directors and founding stockholders could adversely and unpredictably affect the price of those securities 
additionally  the price of our common stock could be affected even by the potential for sales by these persons 
we cannot predict the effect that any future sales of our common stock  or the potential for those sales  will have on our share price 
furthermore  due to relatively low trading volume of our stock  should one or more large stockholders seek to sell a significant portion of their stock in a short period of time  the price of our stock may decline 
we do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we will not distribute cash to our stockholders unless and until we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan 
the time frame for that is unpredictable and investors should not expect dividends in the near future  if at all 
our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  which may make an acquisition of the company by another company more difficult 
we have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest 
specifically  our board of directors  without further action by our stockholders  currently has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights including voting rights  preferences and privileges of these shares blank check preferred 
such preferred stock may have rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock

arrowhead has assembled a broad set of technologies and licenses to enable targeted rnai therapeutics capable of silencing specific gene products in specific cells 
arrowhead has also assembled a proprietary targeting library that may be used with its rnai platforms as well as with small molecule or peptide drugs 
these platforms have yielded several drug candidates under both internal and partnered development 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further information  see note  organization and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements which outlines our application of significant accounting policies and new accounting standards 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed and delivery has occurred  a price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we may generate revenue from technology licenses  collaborative research and development arrangements  research grants and product sales 
revenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and or guaranteed technology license fees  collaborative research funding  and various milestone and future product royalty or profit sharing payments 
revenue associated with research and development funding payments under collaborative agreements is recognized ratably over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research and development period 
revenue from up front license fees  milestones and product royalties are recognized as earned based on the completion of the milestones and product sales  as defined in the respective agreements 
payments received in advance of recognition as revenue are recorded as deferred revenue 
business combinations in october  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of roche madison  inc and certain related intellectual property assets for a  promissory note and  shares of arrowhead common stock  an estimated consideration value of million on the date of the acquisition 
we assigned the value of the consideration to the tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values on the date of acquisition 
the excess of net assets over the consideration was recorded as a nonoperating gain 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of alvos therapeutics  inc in exchange for the issuance of  shares of arrowhead common stock  valued at million at the time of acquisition 
the consideration was assigned to its tangible and intangible assets  and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the time of acquisition 
the allocation of value to certain items  including property and equipment  intangible assets and certain liabilities require management judgment  and is based upon the information available at the time of acquisition 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that our assumptions about the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
if impairment is indicated  recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets consist of in process research and development  patents and license agreements acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition 
intangible assets are monitored for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary 
based on early adoption of asu  the annual review of intangible assets is performed via a two step process 
first  a qualitative assessment is performed to determine if it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired 
if required  a quantitative assessment is performed and  if necessary  impairment is recorded 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes options pricing model  which requires us to make assumptions regarding certain variables including the risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating stock based compensation expense represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties  and if factors change or the company used different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
derivative assets and liabilities we account for warrants and other derivative financial instruments as either equity or assets liabilities based upon the characteristics and provisions of each instrument 
warrants classified as equity are recorded as additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet and no further adjustments to their valuation are made 
some of our warrants were determined to be ineligible for equity classification because of provisions that may result in an adjustment to their exercise price 
warrants classified as derivative liabilities and other derivative financial instruments that require separate accounting as assets or liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair value on the date of issuance and are revalued on each subsequent balance sheet date until such instruments are exercised or expire  with any changes in the fair value between reporting periods recorded as other income or expense 
we estimate the fair value of these assets liabilities using option pricing models that are based on the individual characteristics of the warrants or instruments on the valuation date  as well as assumptions for expected volatility  expected life and risk free interest rate 
changes in the assumptions used could have a material impact on the resulting fair value 
the primary input affecting the value of our derivatives liabilities is the company s stock price 
for example  at september   a change in the value of the company s stock price would affect the value of the derivative liability by approximately million to million  depending on other inputs 
reverse stock split as of november   the company effected a for reverse stock split the reverse stock split 
as a result of the reverse stock split  each ten shares of the company s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the reverse split was combined into one share of common stock 
also  as a result of the reverse stock split  the per share exercise price of  and the number of shares of common stock underlying outstanding company stock options  warrants  series a preferred and any common stock based equity grants outstanding immediately prior to the reverse stock split was proportionally adjusted  based on the one for ten split ratio  in accordance with the terms of such options  warrants or other common stock based equity grants as the case may be 
no fractional shares of common stock were issued in connection with the reverse stock split 
stockholders instead received cash payment in lieu of any fractional shares 
unless otherwise noted  all share and per share amounts in these have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split 
full year review on october   the company acquired roche madison  inc and other intangible assets from roche 
the acquisition included a laboratory research facility in madison  wisconsin comprising over  square feet 
roche madison inc employed employees at the time of the acquisition 
due to the significant new costs associated with the facility  its people and research programs  salary costs  general and administrative costs  and research and development costs increased significantly relative to prior periods 
going forward  we expect this increased cost structure to continue as research and development efforts are accelerated 
on april   the company acquired alvos therapeutics  inc  a targeted therapeutics company 
prior to the acquisition  alvos licensed a large platform proprietary human derived homing peptides and the method for their discovery from md anderson cancer center 
the company hired one employee as a result of the acquisition  and the operations of alvos are being integrated into our research facility in madison  wisconsin 
results of operations the company had a net loss of million for the year ended september   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended september   an increase of million 
the change in the net loss was the result of a number of factors 
during the year ended september   the company recognized income from discontinued operations of million related to the gain on disposal of unidym  which was not repeated in the current period 
in fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charges and recorded as reserve against a receivable from its unconsolidated affiliates  in the amount of million
