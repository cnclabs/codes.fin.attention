the acquisition of color broadband was a business combination accounted for under the acquisition method 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched our wi fi network which is marketed towards mobile operators  internet based marketing companies and wi fi operators 
characteristics of our revenues and expenses we offer our broadband services under agreements having terms of one  two or three years 
pursuant to these agreements  we bill customers on a monthly basis  in advance  for each month of service 
payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized as revenue ratably over the service period 
costs of revenues consists of expenses that are directly related to providing services to our customers  including core network expenses tower and roof rent and utilities  bandwidth costs  points of presence pop maintenance and other and customer network expenses customer maintenance  non installation fees and other customer specific expenses 
we collectively refer to core network and customer network as our network  and core network costs and customer network costs as network costs 
when we first enter a new market  or expand in an existing market  we are required to incur up front costs in order to be able to provide wireless broadband services to commercial customers 
we refer to these activities as establishing a network presence 
these costs include building pops which are company locations where we install a substantial amount of equipment in order to connect numerous customers to the internet 
the costs to build pops are capitalized and expensed over a five year period 
in addition to building pops  we also enter tower and roof rental agreements  secure bandwidth and incur other network costs 
once we have established a network presence in a new market or expanded our network presence in an existing market  we are capable of servicing a significant number of customers through that network presence 
the variable cost to add new customers is relatively modest  especially compared to the upfront cost of establishing or expanding our network presence 
as a result  our gross margins in a market normally increase over time as we add new customers in that market 
however  we may experience variability in gross margins during periods in which we are expanding our network presence in a market 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel and other costs of our sales and marketing teams  as well as marketing initiatives and business development expenses 
customer support services include salaries and related payroll costs associated with our customer support services  customer care  and installation and operations staff

salaries and other related payroll costs for executive management  finance  administration and information systems personnel are included in this category 
other costs include rent  utilities and other facilities costs  accounting  legal and other professional services  and other general operating expenses 
market information we operate in one segment which is the business of wireless broadband services 
although we provide services in multiple markets  these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets  including the nature of the services provided and the type of customers purchasing such services 
while we operate in only one business segment  we recognize that providing information on the revenues and costs of operating in each market can provide useful information to investors regarding our operating performance 
as of december   we operated in twelve markets across the united states including new york  boston  los angeles  chicago  san francisco  miami  seattle  dallas fort worth  philadelphia  nashville  las vegas reno and providence newport 
the markets were launched at different times  and as a result  may have different operating metrics based on their size and stage of maturation 
we incur significant up front costs in order to establish a network presence in a new market 
these costs include building pops and network costs 
other material costs include hiring and training sales and marketing personnel who will be dedicated to securing customers in that market 
once we have established a network presence in a new market  we are capable of servicing a significant number of customers 
the rate of customer additions varies from market to market  and we are unable to predict how many customers will be added in a market during any specific period 
we believe that providing operating information regarding each of our markets provides useful information to shareholders in understanding the leveraging potential of our business model  the operating performance of our mature markets  and the long term potential for our newer markets 
set forth below is a summary of our operating performance on a per market basis  and a description of how each category is determined 
revenues revenues are allocated based on which market each customer is located in 
costs of revenues includes payroll  core network costs and customer network costs that can be allocated to a specific market 
costs that cannot be allocated to a specific market are classified as centralized costs 
operating costs costs which can be specifically allocated to a market include direct sales personnel  certain direct marketing expense  certain customer support and installation payroll expenses and third party commissions 
centralized costs represents costs incurred to support activities across all of our markets that are not allocable to a specific market 
this principally consists of payroll costs for customer care representatives  customer support engineers  sales support  marketing and certain installations personnel 
these individuals service customers across all markets rather than being dedicated to any specific market 
corporate expenses includes costs attributable to corporate overhead and the overall support of our operations 
salaries and related payroll costs for executive management  finance  administration and information systems personnel are included in this category 
other costs include office rent  utilities and other facilities costs  professional services and other general operating expenses 
adjusted market ebitda represents a market s net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  and other income expense

contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period total thereafter capital lease obligations    operating leases    deferred payments     other    total contractual cash obligations   capital lease obligations 
we have entered into capital leases to acquire network and customer premise equipment expiring through march in december  we entered into an agreement with cisco capital to acquire equipment related to our information technology infrastructure 
the lease commences when all of the equipment has been received and installed 
we expect the lease to commence in the second quarter of the principal value of the lease obligation is approximately  and will be paid in varying installments over a month period 
operating leases 
we have entered into operating leases related to roof rights  cellular towers  office space  and equipment leases under various non cancelable agreements expiring through december deferred payments

there were monthly payments of approximately  outstanding as of december other 
in december  we entered into a one year information technology infrastructure support agreement 
the agreement is expected to commence in the second quarter of the monthly payments are approximately  and expected to be paid through the first quarter of impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions pricing for many technology products and services have historically decreased over time due to the effect of product and process improvements and enhancements 
in addition  economic conditions can affect the buying patterns of customers 
in  the core business continued to grow and benefit from a slowly improving economy 
customers  in general  were more willing to make a purchase compared to however they continued to place a premium on value and performance 
an increased need for higher bandwidth resulted in a improvement in overall arpu for pricing of services continued to be a focus for prospective buyers with multi point and midrange product pricing remaining steady while competition for high capacity links intensified 
in part  pressure on high capacity links was due to decreased costs for equipment and some competitors willing to sacrifice margins 
we believe that our customers will continue to upgrade their bandwidth service 
the continued migration of many business activities and functions to the internet  and the growing use of cloud computing should also result in increased bandwidth requirements over the long term 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the amounts of revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the financial statements  we utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming our estimates and judgments  giving appropriate consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to other companies in our industry 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation  or are fundamentally important to our business 
revenue recognition 
we normally enter into contractual agreements with our customers for periods ranging between one to three years 
we recognize the total revenue provided under a contract ratably over the contract period including any periods under which we have agreed to provide services at no cost 
deferred revenues are recognized as a liability when billings are issued in advance of the date when revenues are earned 
we apply the revenue recognition principles set forth under securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  sab which provides for revenue to be recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or installation has been completed  iii the customer accepts and verifies receipt  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
long lived assets with definite lives consist primarily of property and equipment  and intangible assets such as acquired customer contracts 
long lived assets are evaluated periodically for impairment or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
conditions that would result in an impairment charge include a significant decline in the fair value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
when such events or circumstances arise  an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if impairment exists 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value or net realizable value 
business acquisitions 
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method 
the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred on the acquisition date 
when we acquire a business  we assess the acquired assets and liabilities assumed for the appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms  economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date 
the excess of the total consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
if the total consideration is lower than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired  the difference is recognized as a gain on business acquisition 
acquisition costs are expensed and included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in an acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we initially perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill which considers macro economic conditions  industry and market trends  and the current and projected financial performance of the reporting unit 
no further analysis is required if it is determined that there is a less than percent likelihood that the carrying value is greater than the fair value 
we completed a qualitative assessment at the end of and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill as of december  asset retirement obligations 
the fasb guidance on asset retirement obligations addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated costs 
this guidance requires the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
our network equipment is installed on both buildings in which we have a lease agreement company locations and at customer locations 
in both instances  the installation and removal of our equipment is not complicated and does not require structural changes to the building where the equipment is installed 
costs associated with the removal of our equipment at company or customer locations are not material  and accordingly  we have determined that we do not presently have asset retirement obligations under the fasb s accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purposes entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
asu allows entities to assess qualitative factors in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a greater than percent likelihood exists that the fair value is less than the carrying amount  a two step goodwill impairment test must be performed 
we adopted this pronouncement in the fourth quarter of which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk relates to interest rates 
at december   all cash and cash equivalents are immediately available cash balances 
a portion of our cash and cash equivalents are held in three institutional money market funds 
our interest rate risk exposure is to a decline in interest rates which would result in a decline in interest income 
due to our current market yields  a further decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on earnings
