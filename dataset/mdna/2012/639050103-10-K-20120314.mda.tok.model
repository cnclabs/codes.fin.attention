business natus is a leading provider of healthcare products used for the screening  detection  treatment  monitoring and tracking of common medical ailments in newborn care  hearing impairment  neurological dysfunction  epilepsy  sleep disorders  and balance and mobility disorders 
product offerings include computerized neurodiagnostic systems for audiology  neurology  polysomnography  and neonatology  as well as newborn care products such as hearing screening systems  phototherapy devices for the treatment of newborn jaundice  head cooling products for the treatment of brain injury in newborns  incubators to control the newborn s environment  and software systems for managing and tracking disorders and diseases for public health laboratories 
we have completed a number of acquisitions since  consisting of either the purchase of a company  substantially all of the assets of a company  or individual products or product lines 
our significant acquisitions are as follows neometrics in  fischer zoth in  bio logic  deltamed  and olympic in  xltek in  sonamed  schwarzer neurology  and neurocom in  hawaii medical and alpine biomed in  medix in  and embla in we expect to continue to pursue opportunities to acquire other businesses in the future 

table of contents year overview we dealt with a number of challenges in that impacted our operating results 
our operations and financial performance depend significantly on economic conditions in the united states and europe 
the us economy is experiencing a slow economic recovery from recessionary economic conditions and we believe that concerns about the viability of the recovery impact hospital spending 
the european union continues to struggle with an unprecedented sovereign debt crisis that has impacted healthcare spending by ministries of health within the union 
our consolidated revenue increased million for the year ended december  compared to embla  acquired in  and medix  acquired in  contributed million of incremental revenue in we experienced revenue declines across other business units in the united states  europe  and canada in we spent million on restructuring activities to improve efficiencies in operations and eliminate redundant costs from our recent acquisitions 
we acquired embla in september for million in cash 
embla  based in denver  colorado  develops  manufactures and sells devices focused on diagnostic sleep analysis polysomnography or psg with products sold into hospitals and dedicated sleep labs as well as home testing devices 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge as of the october  measurement date 
our impairment analysis was impacted primarily by the significant decrease in the market capitalization of the company as of the measurement date and the continuing deterioration of economic conditions in the fourth quarter within member states of the european union 
we do not believe that our markets have yet returned to the level of activity that prevailed prior to the commencement of the credit crisis in the third quarter of that precipitated the global economic crisis 
as a result of cost containment and other measures we have implemented  and our recent acquisitions  we believe that we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on improving markets when and if economic conditions improve 
application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective and  consequently  our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material effect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosures as of the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition revenue  net of discounts  is recognized from sales of medical devices and supplies  including sales to distributors  when the following conditions have been met a purchase order has been received  title has transferred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
terms of sale for most domestic sales are fob origin  reflecting that title and risk of loss are assumed by the purchaser at the shipping point  however  terms of sale for some neurology  sleep diagnostic  and head cooling systems are fob destination  reflecting that title and risk of loss are assumed by the purchaser upon delivery 
terms of sales to international distributors are generally exw  reflecting that goods are shipped ex works  in which title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point 

table of contents we have historically applied the software revenue recognition rules as prescribed by accounting standards codification asc subtopic to sales of certain of our diagnostic neurology and hearing systems products containing embedded software 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  which amended asc subtopic  and we prospectively adopted the provisions of asu on january  this asu removes tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
in the case of the company s products containing embedded software  we have determined that the hardware and software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality  and therefore  the revenue from the sale of these products no longer falls within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
our revenue recognition policies for sales of these products are now substantially the same as for our other tangible products 
revenue from sales of certain of our products that remain within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules under asc subtopic is not significant 
we previously accounted for arrangements with multiple deliverables under asc topic  where revenue was allocated to the deliverables based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
in october the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends asc topic  and we prospectively adopted the provisions of asu on january  under the revenue recognition rules for tangible products as amended by asu  we now allocate revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling price hierarchy 
a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
the principal deliverables in our multiple deliverable arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting consist of i sales of medical devices and supplies  ii installation services  iii extended service and maintenance agreements  and iv upgrades to embedded software 
the new rules establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe of fair value is defined as the price charged when the same element is sold separately  or if the element has not yet been sold separately  the price for the element established by management having the relevant authority when it is probable that the price will not change before the introduction of the element into the marketplace 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
we have previously established vsoe for substantially all of the deliverables in our multiple element arrangements  however  in the future we may rely on esps  reflecting our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis  to establish the amount of revenue to allocate to the deliverable 
tpe generally does not exist for our products because of their uniqueness 
for products shipped under fob origin or exw terms  delivery is generally considered to have occurred when shipped 
undelivered elements in our sales arrangements  which are not considered to be essential to the functionality of a product  generally include installation or training services that are performed after the related products have been delivered 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is complete at the customer s site 
revenue related to training services is recognized when the service is provided 
fair value for installation or training services is based on the price charged when the service is sold separately 
the fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue from extended service and maintenance agreements  for both medical devices and data management systems  is recognized ratably over the service period 
freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue and freight related expenses are charged to cost of revenue 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as otherwise described above 
we 
table of contents generally do not provide rights of return on products 
we accept trade ins of our own and competitive medical devices 
trade ins are recorded as a reduction of the replacement medical device sale 
provisions are made for initial standard warranty obligations that are generally one year in length 
inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or being held in quantities that exceed anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable salvage value 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives or any determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their estimated fair value could result in additional charges 
we carry goodwill and any other intangible assets with indefinite lives at original cost but do not amortize them 
any future determination that these assets are carried at amounts greater than their estimated fair value could result in additional charges  which could significantly impact our operating results 
we test our definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
impairment is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than its carrying value 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  appropriate discount rates  and operating margins 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually as of october st  this assessment is also performed whenever there is a change in circumstances that indicates the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a two step process 
in the first analysis  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the unit s carrying value  including goodwill  to determine if there is a potential impairment 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and no further analysis or action is required 
if the first analysis indicates that the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second analysis is performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
in step two of the impairment test  the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
that is  the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  including unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of that goodwill 

table of contents to determine the estimated fair value of reporting units  three valuation methodologies are utilized i discounted cash flow analyses  ii market multiples  and iii comparative transactions 
the valuations indicated by these three methodologies are averaged  with the greatest weight placed on discounted cash flow analyses 
discounted cash flow analyses are dependent upon a number of quantitative and qualitative factors including estimates of forecasted revenue  profitability  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ie ebitda and terminal values 
the discount rates applied in the discounted cash flow analyses also have an impact on the estimates of fair value  as use of a higher rate will result in a lower estimate of fair value 
the estimated total fair value of reporting units is reconciled to the company s market capitalization 
for the test as of the october  measurement date we determined that the carrying amount of our european reporting unit exceeded its fair value  indicating a potential goodwill impairment existed 
having determined the goodwill of the european reporting unit was potentially impaired  we performed step two of the goodwill impairment analysis which involved calculating the implied fair value of its goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing the residual value to the carrying amount of goodwill 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the european reporting unit 
key assumptions used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as of the annual testing date of october were i expected cash flow for the period from october  to december   and ii discount rates for its business units ranging from to  which were based on management s best estimate of the after tax weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 
as of october   if forecasted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization within the discounted cash flow analysis had been lower than estimated for each reporting unit except the european reporting unit and all other assumptions were held constant  the goodwill impairment test would have resulted in the same conclusion 
as of october   if the discount rates applied in the company s analysis had been basis points higher than estimated for each reporting unit and all other assumptions were held constant  the goodwill impairment test would have resulted in the same conclusion 
as of october   the fair value of our south america reporting unit was higher than its carrying value under step one of the goodwill impairment analysis 
goodwill allocated to this reporting unit is million 
a future decline in the market capitalization of natus and or a decline in the present value of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit under revised inputs could result in an impairment charge in the future 
such impairment may be difficult to measure in interim reporting periods because of the nature of the south america reporting unit s business cycles 
future changes in the judgments and estimates underlying our analysis of goodwill for possible impairment  including expected future cash flows and discount rate  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in additional impairment of goodwill 
liability for product warranties our medical device products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our medical device products during these service periods 
we base the liability on actual warranty costs incurred to service those products 
on new products  additions to the reserve are based on a combination of factors including the percentage of service department labor applied to warranty repairs  as well as actual service department costs and other judgments  such as the degree to which the product incorporates new technology applied to the number of units sold 
as warranty costs are incurred  the reserve is reduced 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and reductions in our operating profits and results of operations 

table of contents share based compensation we record the fair value of share based compensation awards as expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  expected term  and forfeiture rate 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  expected stock price volatility  expected life  and forfeiture rate assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
if we used different assumptions  we would have recorded different amounts of share based compensation 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenue 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

medix completed on october  medix reported revenue of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition alpine biomed completed on september  alpine biomed reported revenue from its neurology business of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition 
hawaii medical completed on july  hawaii medical reported revenue of approximately million during its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition 
the pre acquisition revenue of our acquired companies may not be indicative of their contribution to revenue in the future 

table of contents comparison of and operating results because our acquisitions have been significant  we measure the contribution to consolidated revenue of the businesses we acquire 
we also analyze our revenue as coming from two sources devices and systems  and supplies and services 
we report freight revenue separate from these two sources 
for the year ended december   our consolidated revenue increased by million  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to our recent acquisitions 
embla  acquired in september  contributed million of revenue in medix  acquired in september  contributed million of revenue in  compared to million of revenue in  or an increase of million

our cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was due mainly to our increased sales 
gross profit increased  or  to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in compared with in  reflecting higher trade materials and manufacturing overhead costs coupled with lower gross profit margins of our medix division  which we owned for only three months in medix realized a gross profit much lower than our consolidated average during because of its revenue was generated through products that it sells in argentina as a distributor for other companies 

table of contents total operating costs increased million  or  to million in  from million in we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge related to our european reporting unit  representing of the increase in total operating costs 
the operations of embla and medix contributed to a million increase in operating costs  offset by a reduction in the fair value of a contingent liability associated with the acquisition of medix and a decrease in incentive compensation associated with lower earnings 
our marketing and selling expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in the operations of embla and medix contributed to million of the increase and the remainder of the increase was primarily related to higher sales commission and sales related costs associated with the increase in our revenue and a  impairment charge relating to tradenames in compared with a  impairment of tradenames in marketing and selling expenses as a percent of total revenue increased to in  from in our research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the operations of embla and medix contributed to million of research and development expense coupled with costs in sustaining engineering to improve existing products

we recorded a restructuring charge of million and other severance related costs of  for which there were no comparable costs in other expenses exclusive of those associated with alpine biomed  medix  restructuring and severance related costs were million higher in compared to  which resulted primarily from increased payroll and related benefit costs  professional fees  travel and outside consulting costs 

table of contents other income expense  net consists of investment income  interest expense  net currency exchange gains and losses  and other miscellaneous income and expense 
we reported other income expense  net of  in  compared to million in investment income of  in was  less than the amount reported for reflecting lower interest rates 
we reported  of foreign currency exchange losses in versus  of foreign exchange gains in interest expense was marginally lower in compared to due primarily to lower outstanding balances on our credit facilities 
we recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to million recorded in our effective tax rate for decreased to from in because more of our income was taxed in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates lower than in the us at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
income tax expense related to our international operations is based on the statutory rates in those jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources comparison of and liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing and to raise capital 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of our current funds and the potential to increase those funds in the future 
we plan to use these resources in meeting our commitments and in achieving our business objectives 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million  compared with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million as of december  as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents outside the us in certain of our foreign operations of approximately million 
we currently intend to permanently reinvest the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if  however  a portion of these funds were needed for and distributed to our operations in the united states  we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
the amount of taxes due would depend on the amount and manner of repatriation  as well as the location from where the funds are repatriated 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and any cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we completed the acquisition of embla at the end of the third quarter of  one acquisition in  two acquisitions in  four acquisitions in  one in  and three in we intend to continue to acquire additional technologies  products  or businesses and these acquisitions could be significant 
these actions would likely affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
in order to finance future acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
any equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increase our cost of capital 
we have a million revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants  including covenants relating to liquidity and other financial measurements  and provides for events of default  including failure to pay any interest when due  failure to perform or observe covenants  bankruptcy or insolvency events and the occurrence of a material adverse effect  and restricts our ability to pay dividends 
we have granted wells fargo a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we did not draw on the facility during and there was no balance outstanding under the facility at december  we have no other significant credit facilities

in our after tax cost of stock based compensation was  more than the tax benefit we received from those arrangements  compared with an excess tax benefit of  in on the exercise of employee stock options 
these amounts were recorded as a decrease to stockholders equity in and as an increase to stockholders equity in we repaid million and million under term loan agreements in the years ended december  and  respectively

we have granted wells fargo a security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we did not draw on the facility during we have no other significant credit facilities 
global capital markets have been  and may continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
the cost and availability of equity and debt funding has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid capital and credit markets 
some lenders have reduced or  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our present needs 
continued turbulence in the united states and international financial markets  however  could adversely affect the cost and availability of financing to us in the future and limit our ability to acquire products  other assets  or businesses

in our after tax cost of stock based compensation was  more than the tax benefit we received from those arrangements which was recorded as a decrease to stockholders equity 
we repaid million and  under term loan agreements in the years ended december  and  respectively 
future liquidity our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue  extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  extent to which we make acquisitions  cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  cost and timing of marketing and selling activities  and availability of borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments result primarily from firm  noncancellable purchase orders placed with contract vendors that manufacture some of the components used in our medical devices and related disposable supply products  as well as commitments for leased office equipment and term loans 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years unconditional purchase obligations operating lease obligations long term debt including current portion and interest total 
table of contents purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the table above does not include obligations under employment agreements for services rendered in the ordinary course of business 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential payments for uncertain tax positions under asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement as a result  the preceding table excludes any potential future payments related to our asc liability for uncertain tax positions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on income taxes 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the u 
s  canada  argentina  and europe and sell those products into more than countries throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
most of our sales in europe and asia are denominated in us dollars and euros and with the acquisitions of xltek in november and medix in  a small portion of our sales are now denominated in canadian dollars and argentine pesos 
as our sales in currencies other than the us dollar increase  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase 
in addition  changes in exchange rates also may affect the end user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors  who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing 
these factors may make our products less competitive in some countries 
if the us dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net income would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us however  because current market conditions have resulted in historically low rates of return on our investments  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  when able  we invest excess cash in bank money market funds or discrete short term investments 
the fair value of our short term investments and cash equivalents investments is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  and the fair value of these investments will fall if market interest rates increase 
however  since we generally have the ability to hold the investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio  and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
off balance sheet arrangements under our bylaws  we have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director s serving in such capacity 
we have a directors and officers liability insurance policy that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid resulting from the indemnification of our officers and directors 
in addition  we enter into indemnification agreements with 
table of contents other parties in the ordinary course of business 
in some cases we have obtained liability insurance providing coverage that limits our exposure for these other indemnified matters 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and have not recorded a liability for these agreements as of december  we had no other off balance sheet arrangements during any of fiscal  or that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity
