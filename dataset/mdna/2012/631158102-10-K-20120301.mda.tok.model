item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in terms of revenue  we are the second largest publicly traded wholesale food distributor in the united states serving the military commissary and exchange systems and the retail grocery industry 
our business consists of three primary operating segments military  food distribution and retail 
our military segment contracts with manufacturers to distribute a wide variety of grocery products to military commissaries and exchanges located in the united states  the district of columbia  europe  puerto rico  cuba  the azores  egypt and bahrain 
we have over years of experience acting as a distributor to us military commissaries and exchanges 
on january   we completed the purchase from gsc enterprises  inc  of substantially all of the assets relating to three wholesale food distribution centers located in san antonio  texas  pensacola  florida and junction city  kansas  including all inventory and customer contracts related to the purchased facilities gsc acquisition 
on december   we purchased a facility in columbus  georgia which began servicing military commissaries and exchanges in the third quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  we purchased a facility in bloomington  indiana and two adjacent facilities in oklahoma city  oklahoma for expansion of our military food distribution business 
the bloomington  indiana facility became operational during the fourth quarter of fiscal  while the oklahoma city  oklahoma facilities are scheduled to become operational during the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we purchased the real estate associated with our pensacola  florida and a norfolk  virginia facility  which had previously been leased facilities  during the third quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  respectively 
our food distribution segment sells and distributes a wide variety of nationally branded and private label grocery products and perishable food products from distribution centers to approximately  independent retail locations located in states  primarily in the midwest and southeast regions of the united states 
our retail segment operated corporate owned stores primarily in the upper midwest as of december  primarily due to highly competitive conditions in which supercenters and other alternative formats compete for price conscious customers  we closed or sold four retail stores in  two retail stores in and six retail stores in we are implementing initiatives of varying scope and duration with a view toward improving our response to and performance under these highly competitive conditions 
these initiatives include designing and reformatting some of our retail stores into alternative formats to increase overall retail sales performance 
as we continue to assess the impact of performance improvement initiatives and the operating results of individual stores  we may need to recognize additional impairments of long lived assets and goodwill associated with our retail segment  and may incur restructuring or other charges in connection with closure or sales activities 
the retail segment yields a higher gross profit percent of sales and higher selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent of sales compared to our food distribution and military segments 
thus  changes in sales of the retail segment can have a disproportionate impact on consolidated gross profit and sg a as compared to similar changes in sales in our food distribution and military segments

liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
we expect that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and enable us to reduce our debt  with temporary draws on our revolving credit line needed during the year to build inventories for certain holidays 
longer term  we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will continue to generate cash flows at current levels as our business is sensitive to trends in consumer spending at our customer locations and our owned retail food stores  as well as certain factors outside of our control  including  but not limited to  the current and future state of the us and global economy  competition  recent and potential future disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the us and worldwide and continued volatility in food and energy commodities

derivative instruments we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
from time to time we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swap agreements and fixed price fuel supply agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 

table of contents we entered into two interest rate swap agreements on october  with notional amounts totaling million 
the term of the agreements was for one year  and they expired on october  during the term of the agreements  these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts were deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses were amortized as an adjustment to expense over the same period in which the related items being hedged were recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts were not considered to be effective in accordance with asc topic asc in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts were immediately recognized in income 
as of december   there were no interest rate swap agreements in existence 
the two commodity swap agreements in place during fiscal with notional amounts totaling million expired during the fourth quarter and were settled for fair market value 
in addition to the previously discussed interest rate swap agreements  from time to time we enter into fixed price fuel supply agreements to support our food distribution segment 
on january   we entered into an agreement which required us to purchase a total of  gallons of diesel fuel per month at prices ranging from to per gallon 
the term of the agreement was for one year and expired on december  the fixed price fuel agreement qualified for the normal purchase exception under asc  therefore the fuel purchases under the contract were expensed as incurred as an increase to cost of sales 
off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this report  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit and finance committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
an accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectability based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 

table of contents as of december   we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for our accounts and notes receivables of million as compared to million as of january  during fiscal  we recorded additional allowance for doubtful account reserves of million and experienced write offs of million 
lease commitments 
we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sub lessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
should the number of defaults by sub lessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
as of december   we have recorded a provision for losses related to leases on closed locations of million as compared to million as of january  during fiscal  we recorded additional provisions for losses related to leases on closed locations of million  which was partially offset by payments made of million 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others 
we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of december  as compared to million as of january   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
we have entered into loan and lease guarantees on behalf of certain food distribution customers that are accounted for under asc topic asc topic provides that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the maximum undiscounted payments we would be required to make in the event of default under the guarantees is million  which is included in the million total referenced above 
these guarantees are secured by certain business assets and personal guarantees of the respective customers 
we believe these customers will be able to perform under the lease agreements and that no payments will be required and no loss will be incurred under the guarantees 
as required by asc topic  a liability representing the fair value of the obligations assumed under the guarantees of million is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all of the other guarantees were issued prior to december  and therefore not subject to the recognition and measurement provisions of asc topic we have also assigned various leases to certain food distribution customers and other third parties 
if the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we estimate our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases  net of reserves  to be approximately million as of december  as compared to million as of january  in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed or assigned by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above in allowance for doubtful accounts methodology and lease commitments 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
triggering these guarantees or obligations under assigned leases would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives

table of contents impairment of long lived assets property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows 
impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales and costs  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets 
estimates of future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets 
an asset impairment would be indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
an impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount 
we generally determine fair value by discounting expected future cash flows at a rate which management has determined to be consistent with assumptions used by market participants 
the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage our business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the impairment charge 
actual outcomes may differ from the estimates 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation of future results could be materially affected by different judgments as to competition  strategies and market conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results 
goodwill we maintain three reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing  which are the same as our reporting segments disclosed in part ii  item of this report under note segment reporting 
goodwill for each of our reporting units is tested for impairment annually and or when factors indicating impairment are present  which requires a significant amount of management s judgment 
such indicators may include a decline in our expected future cash flows  unanticipated competition  the loss of a major customer  slower growth rates or a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we began applying the provision of asc topic in relation to our goodwill impairment testing by applying  to the extent possible  observable market inputs to arrive at the fair values of our reporting units 
our fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an income approach which incorporates a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach that utilizes current earnings multiples for comparable publically traded companies 
our income approach is based on an estimate of future cash flows and a terminal value that factors in estimated long term growth 
the estimate of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist  including operating performance  economic conditions  long term growth rates  capital expenditures  changes in working capital and effective tax rates 
the discount rates applied to the income approach reflect a weighted average cost of capital for comparable publicly traded companies which are adjusted for equity and size risk premiums based on market capitalization 

table of contents we have weighted the valuation of our reporting units at based on the income approach and based on the market approach 
we believe that this weighting is appropriate since it is often difficult to find other appropriate publicly traded companies that are similar to our reporting units and it is our view that future discounted cash flows are more reflective of the value of the reporting units 
our estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as competitive forces  customer behaviors  changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on financial condition and operating results potentially resulting in impairment of the goodwill 
none of the reporting units are more susceptible to economic conditions than others 
the income approach and market approach used to determine fair value are sensitive to changes in discount rates and market trading multiples 
we performed our fiscal annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on conditions as of the end of our third quarter of fiscal and determined that no indication of impairment existed in any of our reporting segments 
the fair value of the retail segment was approximately higher than its carrying value  while the food distribution segment s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately and the military segment s fair value was approximately higher than its carrying value 
discount rates applied in our income approach during fiscal ranged from to and were reflective of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable publically trade companies with an adjustment for equity and size premiums based on market capitalization 
growth rates ranged from to 
for the food distribution segment to have an indication of impairment the discount rate applied would need to increase by or the assumed long term growth rate would need to decrease by more than with a corresponding increase in the discount rate of 
for the retail segment to have an indication of impairment the discount rate applied would need to increase by over or the assumed long term growth rate would need to decrease by over with a corresponding increase in the discount rate of 
while we believe our estimates of fair value of our reporting units are reasonable  there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions  customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur  resulting in a goodwill impairment loss 
please refer to part ii  item in this report under note summary of significant accounting policies under the caption goodwill and intangible assets of this form k for additional information pertaining to our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse or are settled 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions could be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending our positions 
these reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as  related penalties and interest 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 

table of contents reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation  general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
on a per claim basis  our exposure for workers compensation is million  auto liability and general liability is million and for health insurance our exposure is million 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a material impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
a basis point change in discount rates would increase our liability by approximately million 
vendor allowances and credits as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establish a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service provider as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
we also establish reserves for future repayments to vendors for disputed payment deductions related to accounts payable audits  promotional allowances and other items 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have a material impact on our currently recorded reserves 
share based compensation the company is required to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the company uses the grant date market value per share of our common stock to estimate the fair value of restricted stock units rsus and performance units granted pursuant to its long term incentive plan ltip 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options 
no options were granted during fiscal years  or and no options were outstanding as of december  the company uses a lattice model to estimate the fair value of stock appreciation rights sars which contain market conditions 
the value of the portion of the awards ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which is derived from the data in the lattice valuation model 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ materially from those estimates 
significant judgment is required in selecting the assumptions used for estimating fair value of share based compensation as well estimating forfeiture rates 
further  any awards with performance conditions that can affect vesting also add additional judgment in determining the amount expected to vest 
there can be significant volatility in many of our assumptions and therefore our estimates of fair value  forfeitures  etc 
are sensitive to changes in these assumptions 
please refer to part ii  item in this form k under note share based compensation plans for a comprehensive discussion related to our share based compensation plans 

table of contents new accounting standards there have been no recently adopted accounting standards that have resulted in a material impact to the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure in the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to our investment in notes receivable  the balance of our debt obligations outstanding and derivatives employed from time to time to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and diesel fuel prices 
we do not use financial instruments or derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
we carry notes receivable because  in the normal course of business  we make long term loans to certain retail customers 
substantially all notes receivable are based on floating interest rates which adjust to changes in market rates 
as a result  the carrying value of notes receivable approximates market value 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the table below provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
