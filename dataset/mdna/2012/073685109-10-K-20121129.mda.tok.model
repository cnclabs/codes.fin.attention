overview we are one of the largest distributors of residential and non residential roofing materials in the united states and canada 
we are also a distributor of other building materials  including siding  windows  specialty lumber products and waterproofing systems for residential and nonresidential building exteriors 
we purchase products from a large number of manufacturers and then distribute these goods to a customer base consisting of contractors and  to a lesser extent  general contractors  retailers and building material suppliers 
we currently carry up to  skus through branches in the united states and canada 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were in the united states 
we stock one of the most extensive assortments of high quality branded products in the industry  enabling us to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
execution of the operating plan at each of our branches drives our financial results 
revenues are impacted by the relative strength of the residential and non residential roofing markets we serve 
we strive for an appropriate mix of residential  non residential and complementary product sales in all of our regions but allow each of our branches to influence its own marketing plan and mix of products based upon its local market 
we differentiate ourselves from the competition by providing many customer services such as job site delivery  tapered insulation layouts and design and metal fabrication  and by providing credit 
we consider customer relations and our employees knowledge of roofing and exterior building materials to be important to our ability to increase customer loyalty and maintain customer satisfaction 
we invest significant resources in training our employees in sales techniques  management skills and product knowledge 
while we consider these attributes important drivers of our business  we also continually pay close attention to controlling operating costs 
our growth strategy includes both internal growth opening new branches  growing sales with existing customers  adding new customers and introducing new products and acquisition growth 
our main acquisition strategy is to target market leaders in geographic areas that we do not service 
our may acquisition of enercon products inc enercon is one example of this approach 
enercon is a roofing distributor with six locations in western canada 
headquartered within its branch in edmonton  enercon also has branches in calgary  regina and saskatoon and two branches in vancouver  with no branch overlap with our existing operations 
in addition  we also acquire smaller companies to supplement branch openings within existing markets 
our july acquisition of structural materials co 
structural  a distributor of residential and commercial roofing products and related accessories headquartered in santa ana  ca  is an example of this second approach 
structural has six locations in los angeles and orange counties and in the surrounding areas  which we integrated into our existing pacific supply region in southern california 
general we sell all materials necessary to install  replace and repair residential and non residential roofs  including shingles  single ply roofing  metal roofing and accessories  modified bitumen  built up roofing  insulation  slate and tile  fasteners  coatings and cements  and other roofing accessories 
we also sell complementary building products such as vinyl siding  doors  windows and millwork  wood and fiber cement siding  residential insulation  and waterproofing systems 
the following is a summary of our net sales by product group in thousands for the last three full fiscal years  and 
percentages may not total due to rounding 
year ended september  net sales mix net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products   non residential roofing products   complementary building products   we have over  customers  none of which represents more than of our net sales 
many of our customers are small to mid size contractors with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain strict credit review and approval policies  which has helped to keep losses from uncollectible customer receivables within our expectations 
bad debts in were within our normal historical levels at approximately of net sales  while bad debts in were slightly higher than normal levels at of net sales but still within our tolerance in consideration of the challenging economic and credit climate 
our expenses consist primarily of the cost of products purchased for resale  labor  fleet  occupancy  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete for business and may respond to competitive pressures at times by lowering prices in order to maintain our market share 
we opened four new branches in  three in and none in we slowed the pace of new branch openings since  mostly as a result of the economic downturn  but expect to increase the pace in typically  when we open a new branch  we transfer a certain level of existing business from an existing branch to the new branch 
this allows the new branch to commence with a base business and also allows the existing branch to target other growth opportunities 
in managing our business  we consider all growth  including the opening of new branches  to be internal growth unless it is a result of an acquisition 
when we refer to growth in existing markets in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we include growth from existing and newly opened branches but exclude growth from acquired branches until they have been under our ownership for at least four full fiscal quarters at the start of the reporting period 
our average annual internal sales growth over the eight fiscal years since our ipo has been 
when we refer to our net product costs  we are referring to our invoice cost less the impact of short term buying programs also referred to as special buys given the manner in which they are offered 
results of operations the following discussion compares our results of operations for  and the following table shows  for the periods indicated  information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods presented

year ended september  net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses income from operations interest expense and other financing costs income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to the following table shows a summary of our results of operations for and  broken down by existing markets and acquired markets 
existing markets acquired markets consolidated in thousands net sales     gross profit     gross margin operating expenses     operating expenses as a of net sales operating income loss    operating margin net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to  million in from  million in existing market sales increased million or based on the same number of business days 
acquired market sales increased million due to a full year s sales impact from the acquisitions and the partial year impact from our acquisitions 
we attribute the existing market sales increase primarily to the following factors better weather conditions in the first half of this year allowed for an increase in roofing activities  especially residential roofing  strong growth in the first half of this year in the markets affected by last year s storms  strong growth in non residential roofing activity in most of our regions through the second quarter  and industry wide price increases in our roofing product groups since last year s second quarter 
partially offset by less roofing activity in the back half of this year in the markets affected by last spring s hail storms  and a slowdown in non residential roofing activity during the back half of this year 
in  we acquired twenty two branches  opened four new branches  and closed two branches 
in  we have estimated the impact of inflation or deflation on our sales and gross profit by looking at changes in our average selling prices and gross margins discussed below 
average selling prices were up overall in compared to  with price increases of non residential products at 
residential roofing product prices were up slightly at  while complementary product prices were up 
the higher gross margins in are an indicator that the inflation in our net product costs was less than the impact from the increase in our average selling prices 
existing market net sales by geographical region increased decreased as follows northeast  mid atlantic  southeast  southwest  midwest  west  and canada 
these variations were primarily caused by short term factors such as local economic conditions  weather conditions and storm activity that influence the comparisons of a single geographical region 
we had business days in compared to in the product group sales for our existing markets were as follows for the fiscal years ended change based on average sales change per business day dollars in millions net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products for  our acquired markets recognized sales of  and million in residential roofing products  non residential roofing products and complementary building products  respectively

the existing market sales of  million plus the sales from acquired markets of million agrees to our reported total sales of  million 
prior year sales by product group are presented in a manner consistent with the current year s product classifications 
we believe the existing market information is useful to investors because it helps explain organic growth or decline 
gross profit change dollars in millions gross profit existing markets gross margin existing markets our existing market gross profit increased million or in  while our acquired market gross profit increased million 
our overall and existing market gross margins increased to and in  respectively  from in the higher gross margins in were due primarily to improved gross margins in residential roofing product sales and an increase in our mix of those residential product sales  which generally have higher gross margins than our other products 
direct sales products shipped by our vendors directly to our customers  which typically have substantially lower gross margins than our warehouse sales  represented and of our net sales in and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the lower mix of non residential roofing product sales  which are more commonly facilitated by direct shipment 
there were no material divisional impacts from changes in the direct sales mix of our geographical regions 
operating expenses change dollars in millions operating expenses existing markets operating expenses as a of sales existing markets operating expenses in our existing market increased million or in to million  compared to million in  while our acquired market expenses increased by million to million 
the following factors were the leading causes of the higher operating expenses in our existing markets increased payroll and related costs of million primarily due to higher incentive based pay  overtime pay  certain benefits and payroll taxes  increased selling expenses of million from higher fuel and transportation costs and credit card fees  and increases in general and administrative costs of million principally from higher professional fees  severance costs  general insurance costs and travel expenses  partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization expense of million from lower amortization of intangibles and reduced depreciation from the impact of low capital expenditures in recent years  and decreased bad debts of million due primarily to a lower percentage of past due accounts as improvement in the roofing industry enabled more of our customers to stay current with their required payments 
in and  we expensed a total of million and million  respectively  for the amortization of intangible assets recorded under purchase accounting  including the impact from acquired markets 
our existing market operating expenses as a percentage of the related net sales decreased to in from in due to the positive impact from the higher sales  partially offset by the impact from the above increases 
interest expense and other financing costs interest expense and other financing costs were million in compared to million in the expense includes a charge of million for the recognition of the fair value of certain interest rate derivatives and million resulting from the refinancing of our debt 
these negative factors on interest expense and other financing costs in were partially offset by the benefit from lower outstanding total debt 
interest expense and other financing costs would have been and million lower in and  respectively  without the impact of our interest rate derivatives 
income taxes income tax expense was million in  an effective tax rate of  compared to million in  which was an effective tax rate of 
the income tax expense includes the beneficial impact of million  diluted earnings per share  from the reversal of the net deferred tax liability associated with a change in the tax status of our canadian operations as discussed below 
without that benefit  our effective tax rate would have been approximately in we expect our future annual income tax rate to average approximately to  excluding any discrete items

existing markets acquired markets consolidated in thousands net sales     gross profit     gross margin operating expenses     operating expenses as a of net sales operating income loss    operating margin net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to billion in from billion in existing market sales increased million or based on the same number of business days  while acquired market sales increased million due to a full year s sales impact from the acquisitions and the impact from the may enercon acquisition 
we attribute the existing market sales increase primarily to the following factors strong growth in the markets affected by the spring of s hail storms  continued strong growth in non residential roofing activity in most of the other regions  and industry wide increases in asphalt shingle and other prices  partially offset by volume declines in residential re roofing activity in a few regions 
in  we acquired six branches  opened three new branches  and closed three branches 
in  we estimated the impact of inflation or deflation on our sales and gross profit by looking at changes in our net product costs and invoiced gross margins  and since we experienced an approximate increase in residential roofing product costs and approximately increases in non residential and complementary product costs 
the net impact of these factors increased our overall net product costs by approximately  although we believe average sales prices may have increased at a slightly higher rate as mentioned in the discussion of gross profit below 
we had business days in compared to in net sales  excluding acquired branches  increased in every geographical region as follows northeast  mid atlantic  southeast  southwest  midwest  west  and canada 
these variations were primarily caused by short term factors such as local economic conditions  weather conditions and storm activity 
the product group sales for our existing markets were as follows for the fiscal years ended change based on average sales change per business day dollars in millions net sales mix net sales mix residential roofing products non residential roofing products complementary building products for  our acquired markets recognized sales of  and million in residential roofing products  non residential roofing products and complementary building products  respectively

the existing market sales of  million plus the sales from acquired markets of million agrees to our reported total sales of  million 
sales by product group for are presented in a manner consistent with the product classifications 
we believe the existing market information is useful to investors because it helps explain organic growth or decline 
gross profit change dollars in millions gross profit existing markets gross margin existing markets our existing market gross profit increased million or in  while our acquired market gross profit increased million 
our overall and existing market gross margins increased to from in from the margin rate was lower than the historical average rate due to a more competitive market and low demand in in  there was more storm demand and average selling prices increased in most of our markets  which allowed us to generate gross margins more consistent with our historical results 
in addition  we were able to increase our inventory levels ahead of certain vendor price increases 
however  our mix of non residential product sales  which generally have lower gross margins  increased slightly in direct sales products shipped by our vendors directly to our customers  which typically have substantially lower gross margins than our warehouse sales  represented and of our net sales in and  respectively 
this slight increase in the percentage of direct sales was primarily attributable to the slightly higher mix of non residential roofing product sales  which are more commonly facilitated by direct shipment 
there were no material regional impacts from changes in the direct sales mix of our geographical regions 
operating expenses change dollars in millions operating expenses existing markets operating expenses as a of sales existing markets operating expenses in our existing markets increased by million or in to million from million in  while our acquired market expenses increased million 
the following factors were the leading causes of the higher operating expenses in our existing markets increased payroll and related costs of million due to higher incentive based and overtime pay  primarily associated with our higher sales and operating results  along with higher related payroll taxes and certain benefits  increased selling expenses of million principally from higher fuel costs  outsourced trucking expenses  credit card fees and other selling expenses  and increased bad debt expense of million mainly due to an increased estimated allowance for potential bad debts  partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization expense of million from lower amortization of intangibles and reduced depreciation from the impact of low capital expenditures in recent years  and savings in warehouse expenses of million mainly from lower maintenance costs 
in  we expensed a total of million for the amortization of intangible assets recorded under purchase accounting compared to million in our existing market operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in due to the positive impact from the higher sales  partially offset by the impact from the above increases 
interest expense and other financing costs interest expense and other financing costs decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower debt and the expiration of certain interest rate derivatives in april that carried higher interest rates than the rates on our current derivatives 
in addition  we benefited from low interest rates on the portion of our debt no longer hedged 
interest expense and other financing costs would have been and million less in and  respectively  without the impact of our derivatives 
income taxes income tax expense was million in  an effective tax rate of  compared to million in  which was an effective tax rate of 
this year s income tax expense includes the beneficial impact of million  diluted earnings per share  from the reversal of the net deferred tax liability associated with a change in the tax status of our canadian operations as discussed below 
without that benefit  our effective tax rate would have been approximately in the effective rate included benefits totaling million from reversals of certain discrete tax reserves and releases of valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  our request to have our canadian subsidiary beacon roofing supply canada company or brscc treated as a controlled foreign corporation cfc  retroactive to october   was approved by the irs 
brscc was previously treated as a pass through or disregarded entity for us federal income tax purposes 
subsequent to october   brscc s taxable income  which reflects all of our canadian operations  is being taxed only in canada and would generally be taxed in the us only upon an actual or deemed distribution 
we expect to indefinitely reinvest brscc s earnings and therefore no us deferred tax asset or liability for the differences between the book basis and the tax basis of brscc will be recorded in the foreseeable future 
unremitted earnings of million were considered permanently reinvested at september  a quantification of the associated deferred tax liability on those unremitted earnings of brscc has not been made  as the determination of such liability is not practicable 
asc provides that the effect of an election for a voluntary change in tax status is recognized for accounting purposes on the approval date 
therefore all of the associated adjustments to our income tax accounts for the above approved election were recorded in the fourth quarter of  including the adjustments resulting from a lower canadian tax rate compared to the us tax rate in and deferred assets and liabilities that were recorded over the time brscc was treated as a pass through entity were derecognized and the resulting impact of million was included in income from continuing operations  including the reversal of a deferred tax liability of million previously reported as a component of other comprehensive income 
the reversal was recorded in current year earnings  as backwards tracing of such amounts to other comprehensive income is prohibited 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations in general  sales and net income are highest during our first  third and fourth fiscal quarters  which represent the peak months of construction and re roofing  especially in our branches in the northern and mid western us and in canada 
we have historically incurred low net income levels or net losses during the second quarter when our sales are substantially lower 
we generally experience an increase in inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable during the third and fourth quarters of the year as a result of the seasonality of our business 
our peak cash usage generally occurs during the third quarter  primarily because accounts payable terms offered by our suppliers typically have due dates in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur from june through november 
we generally experience a slowing of our accounts receivable collections during our second quarter  mainly due to the inability of some of our customers to conduct their businesses effectively in inclement weather in certain of our divisions 
we continue to attempt to collect those receivables  which require payment under our standard terms 
we do not provide material concessions to our customers during this quarter of the year 
our vendors are also affected by the seasonality in the industry and are more likely to provide seasonal incentives in our second quarter as a result of the lower level of roofing activity 
we generally experience our peak working capital needs during the third quarter after we build our inventories following the winter season but before we begin collecting on most of our spring receivables 
certain quarterly financial data the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the fiscal years and which  in the opinion of management  reflect all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily indicative of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 
totals may not total due to rounding 
fiscal year fiscal year qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr qtr dollars in millions  except per share data unaudited net sales gross profit income loss from operations net income loss earnings loss per share basic earnings loss per share fully diluted quarterly sales as of year s sales quarterly gross profit as of year s gross profit quarterly income loss from operations as of year s income from operations earnings in the first quarter of fiscal included the beneficial impact of million  or diluted earnings per share  from the reduction in the liability for enercon products contingent consideration 
earnings in the third quarter of fiscal were impacted by the following charges million million net of tax  or diluted earnings per share  for the recognition of the fair value of certain interest rate derivatives in interest expense and other financing costs  million million net of tax  or diluted earnings per share  resulting from the refinancing  and million  or diluted earnings per share  from the increase in the liability for enercon products contingent consideration 
earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal included a charge of million million net of tax for termination benefits  or diluted earnings per share  associated with the july acquisition of structural materials co 
and the retirement of one of our officers  and a benefit of million million net of tax  or diluted earnings per share  for the recognition of the fair value of certain interest rate derivatives in interest expense and other financing costs 
earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal included the beneficial impact of million  diluted earnings per share  from the reversal of a net deferred tax liability associated with a change in the tax status of our canadian operations 
the calculation of the net loss per share for the second quarter of does not include the effects of outstanding stock awards since the impact would have been anti dilutive 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate 
in general  we have been able to pass on price increases from our vendors to our customers in a timely manner 
although we experienced fluctuations in average inventory prices that were consistent throughout the industry during and  inflation and changing prices did not have a material impact on our net operating results in or liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at september  compared to million at september  our net working capital was million at september  compared to million at september  compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the higher cash from operations was due to the increase in net income of million and higher non cash adjustments of million  mostly offset by more cash used by working capital changes of million  net of the impact of businesses acquired 
changes in working capital in included decreases in accounts receivable and inventories of and million  respectively 
the positive impact from those changes  however  were more than offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable was due to improved collections from customers in as compared to our days sales outstanding calculated based on the ending accounts receivable balance and the most recent quarter s sales were down slightly due to the improvement in collections from our customers and more residential sales  which generally have shorter payment terms 
inventory turns were relatively flat year over year  as the impact of a higher inventory level was offset by the positive impact of higher sales 
the higher level of inventory was primarily due to our acquisitions during the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to a lower level of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter of compared to lastly  the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was mostly due to an increase in amounts due from vendors for incentives 
net cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million used in capital expenditures were million in compared to million in in addition  we spent million on acquisitions in compared to million in we currently expect fiscal year capital expenditures to total between to of net sales  mostly dependent upon our sales volume and exclusive of the impact of new branch openings 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million used in in  there were million of loan repayments  net of proceeds of million from our new term loan and million from new loans under our equipment financing facility 
we borrowed million under our new revolving lines of credit 
we also received million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and paid million in deferred financing costs in the financing activities in primarily reflected repayments under our credit and equipment financing facilities  net of proceeds of million from new loans under our equipment financing facility  and proceeds from exercises of stock options 
compared to our net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the higher cash from operations was due to the increase in net income of million  mostly offset by cash used by working capital changes  net of the impact of businesses acquired 
changes in working capital provided a favorable increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a favorable decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
these were more than offset by unfavorable increases in accounts receivable and inventories of and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was primarily due to a higher level of inventory purchases later this year and higher accrued income taxes 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to stronger fourth quarter sales in as compared to our days sales outstanding calculated based on the ending accounts receivable balance and the most recent quarter s sales were down slightly due to the stronger fourth quarter sales and a lower fourth quarter mix of non residential sales this year  which generally have longer payment terms 
inventory turns were relatively flat year over year  as the impact of this year s larger build up of inventory was offset by the impact of the higher sales 
the higher level of inventory was primarily due to more normal purchasing levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year  when we curtailed fourth quarter purchases 
we also maintained higher levels of inventories in the branches that serviced storm demand in in addition  we have seen average overall product costs increase approximately from to lastly  the decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets was mostly due to declines in prepaid income taxes and amounts due from vendors for incentives 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this increase was due to the cost of our acquisitions and higher capital spending for transportation and material handling equipment 
net cash used by financing activities was million in compared to million in these amounts primarily reflected repayments under our credit facilities  partially offset by proceeds from new equipment financings million in and from the exercise of stock options 
capital resources our principal source of liquidity at september  was our cash and cash equivalents of million and our available borrowings of million under revolving lines of credit  which takes into account all of the debt covenants under the credit facility see below  including the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio 
borrowings outstanding under the revolving lines of credit in the accompanying balance sheet at september  and september  were classified as short term debt 
this was because there is no current expectation of a minimum level of outstanding revolver borrowings in the twelve months following and we paid off the september  borrowings in liquidity is defined as the current amount of readily available cash and the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current needs for cash 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
our cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid money market funds which invest primarily in commercial paper or bonds with a rating of a or better  and bank certificates of deposit 
significant factors which could affect future liquidity include the following the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms  cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  and capital expenditures 
our primary capital needs are for working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations and cash equivalents  supplemented by bank borrowings 
in the past  we have paid for acquisitions from cash on hand or financed them initially through increased bank borrowings  the issuance of common stock and or other borrowings 
we then repay any such borrowings with cash flows from operations 
we have funded our past capital expenditures through increased bank borrowings  including equipment financing  or through capital leases  and then have reduced these obligations with cash flows from operations 
we believe we have adequate current liquidity and availability of capital to fund our present operations  meet our commitments on our existing debt and fund anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually seek potential acquisitions and from time to time hold discussions with acquisition candidates 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a strong base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms  as we have in the past 
we may also issue additional shares of common stock to raise funds  which we last did in december  or we may issue preferred stock 
monitoring and assessing collectability of accounts receivable we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and typically do not require collateral  although we typically obtain payment and performance bonds for any type of public work and have the ability to lien projects under certain circumstances 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from most customers within days  except for sales to our commercial roofing contractors  which we typically require to pay in days 
as our business is seasonal in certain geographic regions  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months and our past due accounts receivable balance as a percentage of total receivables generally increases during this time 
throughout the year  we closely monitor our receivables and record estimated reserves based upon our judgment of specific customer situations  aging of accounts and our historical write offs of uncollectible accounts 
our regional credit offices are staffed to manage and monitor our receivable aging balances and our systems allow us to enforce pre determined credit approval levels and properly leverage new business 
the credit pre approval process denotes the maximum requested credit amount that each level of management can approve  with the highest credit amount requiring approval by our ceo and cfo 
there are daily communications with branch and field staff 
our regional offices conduct periodic reviews with their branch managers  various regional management staff and the vp credit 
depending on the state of the respective region s receivables  these reviews can be weekly  bi weekly or monthly 
additionally  the regions are required to submit a monthly receivable forecast to the vp credit 
on a monthly basis  the vp credit will review and discuss these forecasts  as well as a prior month recap  with the ceo and cfo 
periodically  we perform a specific analysis of all accounts past due and write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote based upon the following factors aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  review of the customer s financial statements when available  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
we still pursue collection of amounts written off in certain circumstances and credit the allowance for any subsequent recoveries 
in the past  annual bad debts typically averaged approximately of net sales 
in  bad debts declined to only of net sales 
in  bad debts increased slightly to of net sales  which was still within our tolerance in consideration of the challenging economic and credit climate 
indebtedness we currently have the following credit facilities a senior secured credit facility in the us  a canadian senior secured credit facility  and an equipment financing facility 
senior secured credit facility on april   we replaced the prior credit facility see below with a new five year senior secured credit facility that includes a million us credit facility and a c million million canadian credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  and a syndicate of other lenders combined  the credit facility 
we paid off debt of million that was outstanding under the prior credit facility with the proceeds from the credit facility and from approximately million of cash on hand 
the million u 
s credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility of million the us revolver  which includes a sub facility of million for letters of credit  and a million term loan the term loan 
the term loan has required amortization of per year that is payable in quarterly installments  with the balance due on march  we may increase the credit facility by up to million under certain conditions 
there was and million outstanding under the us revolver and term loan  respectively  at september  there were million of outstanding standby letters of credit at september interest borrowings under the credit facility carry interest at a margin above the libor rate 
the margin is currently per annum and can range from to per annum depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility 
the credit facility also provides for a us base rate  defined in the agreement as the higher of the prime rate  or the federal funds rate plus  plus a margin above that rate 
in addition  the canadian credit facility permits borrowings under a base rate  defined in the agreement as the higher of the canadian prime rate  or the annual rate of interest equal to the sum of the cdor rate plus  plus a margin above that rate 
the margin for both base rates is currently per annum and can range from to per annum depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio  as defined in the credit facility 
current unused commitment fees on the revolving credit facilities are per annum 
the unused commitment fees can range from to per annum  again depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio 
our outstanding borrowings under the us revolver at september  carried an interest rate of libor plus at september  for million and the remainder at the base rate 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the canada revolver 
the term loan balance carried an interest rate of libor plus at september  
financial covenants under the credit facility are as follows maximum consolidated total leverage ratio on the last day of each fiscal quarter  our consolidated total leverage ratio the ratio of our outstanding debt to our trailing twelve month earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  as more fully defined in the credit facility  must not be greater than  or under a one time request by us subsequent to an acquisition that meets the requirements under the credit facility 
at september   this ratio was minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio on the last day of each fiscal quarter  our consolidated interest coverage ratio the ratio of our trailing twelve month earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation to our cash interest expense for the same period  as more fully defined in the credit facility  must not be less than at september   this ratio was as of september   we were in compliance with these covenants 
substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock and assets of wholly owned subsidiaries  secure obligations under the credit facility 
prior credit facility on november   we entered into an amended and restated seven year million us senior secured credit facility and a c million senior secured canadian credit facility with ge antares capital ge antares and a syndicate of other lenders combined  the prior credit facility 
the prior credit facility provided for a cash receipts lock box arrangement that gave us sole control over the funds in lock box accounts  unless excess availability was less than million or an event of default occurred  in which case the senior secured lenders would have had the right to take control over such funds and to apply such funds to repayment of the senior debt 
the prior credit facility consisted of a us revolving credit facility providing up to million  which included a sub facility of million for letters of credit  and a term loan with an initial principal amount of million term loan the prior term loan 
the prior credit facility also included a c million senior secured revolving credit facility provided by ge canada finance holding company 
the prior term loan required amortization of per year  payable in quarterly installments of approximately million  and the remainder was scheduled to be due in the prior credit facility could have also been expanded by up to an additional million under certain conditions 
there were million of outstanding standby letters of credit at september  there were mandatory prepayments under the prior credit facility under certain conditions  including the following cash flow condition excess cash flow by may of each fiscal year  we were required to pay an amount equal to of the excess cash flow as defined in the prior credit facility for the prior fiscal year  not to exceed million with respect to any fiscal year 
based on our results for fiscal year  a required payment of million was due by may and was paid in january a payment of million was also made in january for fiscal year the amount payable under this provision as of september  was classified as short term debt 
equipment financing facilities as of september   there was a total of million outstanding under prior equipment financing facilities  with fixed interest rates ranging from to and payments due through september subsequent to september   we entered into a new equipment financing facility that provides financing for up to million of purchased transportation and material handling equipment through october  the applicable interest rate at the time of the advances will be approximately above the year term swap rate for year loans and above the year term swap rate for year loans 
contractual obligations at september   contractual obligations were as follows in millions fiscal years thereafter senior bank debt and revolver equipment financing operating leases interest non cancelable purchase obligations total interest payments reflect all currently scheduled amounts along with projected amounts to be paid under the senior bank debt using a libor curve to estimate the future interest rates and considering our current interest rate hedges 
in general  we purchase products under purchase obligations that are cancelable by us without cost or expire after days 
capital expenditures we incurred capital expenditures of  and million in  and  respectively 
typically  over of our capital expenditures have generally been made for transportation and material handling equipment 
in  we incurred a lower spend rate with capital expenditures at of sales as we reduced capital expenditures due to the business slowdown 
we currently expect future annual capital expenditures to be approximately of net sales  exclusive of the impact of new branch openings and assuming improved economic and industry conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as us gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following accounting policies that require us to make the most subjective or complex judgments in order to fairly present our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for employee and non employee director stock based compensation using the fair value method of accounting 
compensation cost arising from stock options and restricted stock awards granted to employees and non employee directors is recognized using the straight line method over the vesting period  which represents the requisite service or performance period 
in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation  we estimate option forfeitures and project the number of restricted shares and units that are expected to vest based on the related performance measures 
in addition  we report the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost as both a financing cash inflow and an operating cash outflow 
the excess tax benefit classified as a financing activity would have been classified as an operating inflow if we did not use the fair value method 
interest rate swaps we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the swap agreements are contracts to exchange variable rate for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we record the effective portions of changes in their fair value  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
the effectiveness of the hedges is periodically assessed by management during the lives of the hedges by comparing the current terms of the hedges with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide and through an evaluation of the ability of the counterparties to the hedges to honor their obligations under the hedges 
any ineffective portions of the hedges are recognized in earnings through interest expense and other financing costs 
our refinancing transaction on april   resulted in hedge ineffectiveness on the derivative instruments that expire in april  as the underlying term debt being hedged was repaid before the expiration of the derivative instruments 
this resulted in a charge to interest expense and other financing costs in the third quarter of for the fair value of the derivative instruments previously recorded as a component of comprehensive loss 
subsequent changes in the fair value of those swaps are also being recognized in interest expense and other financing costs 
our new derivative instrument entered into in is designated as a cash flow hedge  for which we record the effective portions of changes in its fair value  net of tax  in other comprehensive income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the failure of our customers to make required payments 
we charge write offs against our allowance for doubtful accounts  although we still pursue collection in certain circumstances and credit the allowance for any subsequent recoveries 
inventory valuation product inventories represent one of our largest assets and are recorded at net realizable value 
our goal is to manage our inventory so that we minimize out of stock positions 
to do this  we maintain an adequate inventory of skus at each branch based on sales history 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory 
we monitor our inventory levels by branch and record provisions for excess inventories based on slower moving inventory 
we define potential excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the historical usage  excluding items purchased in the last three months 
we then review our most recent history of sales and adjustments of such excess inventory and apply our judgment as to forecasted demand and other factors  including liquidation value  to determine the required adjustments to net realizable value 
in addition  at the end of each year  we evaluate our inventory at each branch and write off and dispose of obsolete products 
our inventories are generally not susceptible to technological obsolescence 
during the year  we perform periodic cycle counts and write off excess or damaged inventory as needed 
at year end  we take a physical inventory and record any necessary additional write offs 
vendor rebates our typical rebate arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount  payable to us after we make a special purchase or after we achieve any of a number of measures generally related to the volume of our purchases over a period of time  usually quarterly or annually 
we account for these rebates as a reduction of the prices of the related vendors products  which reduces the inventory cost until the period in which we sell the product  at which time these rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of rebates receivable for the periodic programs based upon the expected level of purchases 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
historically  our actual rebates have been within our expectations used for our estimates 
if we fail to achieve a measure which is required to obtain a vendor rebate  we will have to record a charge in the period that we determine the criteria or measure for the vendor rebate will not be met to the extent the vendor rebate was estimated and included as a reduction to cost of sales 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
although these changes would not affect the amounts which we have recorded related to products already purchased  it may impact our gross margin on products we sell or revenues earned in future periods 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize revenue at the point of sale or upon delivery to the customer s site 
for goods shipped by third party carriers  we recognize revenue upon shipment since the terms are fob shipping point 
approximately of our revenues are for products delivered by us or picked up by our customers at our facilities  which provides for timely and accurate revenue recognition 
we also ship certain products directly from the manufacturer to the customer 
revenues are recognized upon notifications of deliveries from our vendors 
delays in receiving delivery notifications could impact our financial results  although it has not been material to our consolidated results of operations in the past 
we also provide certain job site delivery services  which include crane rentals and rooftop deliveries of certain products  for which the associated revenues are recognized upon completion of the services 
these revenues represent less than of our net sales 
all revenues recognized are net of sales taxes collected  allowances for discounts and estimated returns  which are provided for at the time of pick up or delivery 
in the past  customer returns have not been material to our consolidated results of operations 
all sales taxes collected are subsequently remitted to the appropriate government authorities 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires us to recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities to the extent that they are realizable 
deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
see the compared to income taxes discussion above and note for a discussion of the impact from a change in the tax status of our canadian operations in fasb asc topic  income taxes asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
based on this guidance  we analyze our filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based solely on its technical merits 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
examples of such indicators include a significant change in the business climate  unexpected competition  loss of key personnel or a decline in our market capitalization below our net book value 
as discussed below  we adopted guidance in that permits companies to perform a qualitative assessment based on economic  industry and company specific factors as the initial step in the annual goodwill impairment test for all or selected reporting units 
based on the results of the qualitative assessment  companies are only required to perform step of the annual impairment test for a reporting unit if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount  the two step approach is applied 
the first step would require a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component ie a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by component managers 
we currently have five components which we evaluate for aggregation 
we evaluate the distribution methods  sales mix  and operating results of each of our components to determine if these characteristics have or will be sustained over a long term basis 
for purposes of this evaluation  we would expect our components to exhibit similar economic characteristics years after events such as an acquisition within our core roofing business or management business restructuring 
this evaluation also considers major storm activity or local economic challenges that may impact the short term operations of an individual component 
components that exhibit similar economic characteristic are subsequently aggregated into a single reporting unit 
based on our evaluation at august   one of the five components did not exhibit similar economic characteristics and therefore was individually evaluated for goodwill impairment as a separate reporting unit the individual reporting unit 
this was primarily due to the fact that this component had an above average concentration of residential business that provided gross margin and operating income rates well above the company average 
the remaining components were aggregated into a second reporting unit the aggregated reporting unit 
the individual reporting unit represents approximately of the consolidated operating income  while the aggregated reporting unit comprises the remaining 
we concluded that the fair values for both the aggregated and individual reporting unit more likely than not exceeded their respective carrying values at the goodwill measurement date 
this position is consistent with the operating results in which sales and operating income for the aggregated reporting unit exceeded those in the prior year by and  respectively 
in addition  sales and operating income for the individual reporting unit exceeded those in the prior year by and  respectively 
we further expect both the aggregated and individual reporting units to experience moderate growth in the near future 
our analysis further noted the total market capitalization exceeded the company s carrying value by approximately at august  this compares to for that same measure at august  in addition  we did not identify any macroeconomic or industry conditions or cost related factors that would indicate the fair values of the two reporting units were more likely than not to be less than their respective carrying values 
lastly  there have been no events or circumstances since the date of the above assessments that would change our conclusion 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate it is more likely than not that the fair values of any of our reporting units under the guidelines discussed above have fallen below their carrying values  we would test such reporting units for impairment 
adoption of recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued accounting standards no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which permits an entity the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with subtopic an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we early adopted this update for our review of our other intangible assets for in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previous guidance under topic required an entity to test goodwill for impairment  on at least an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill step one 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
under the amendments in this update  an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
we early adopted this update for our goodwill impairment testing for as described under goodwill above 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards no 
 an amendment to business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  which specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments in this update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  our adoption of this update in did not have an impact on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards no 
an amendment to intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
the new guidance modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples in paragraph  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  our adoption of this amendment in did not have an impact on the financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends the criteria for allocating a contract s consideration to individual services or products in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance was effective for us beginning in but did not have an impact on the financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued financial accounting statement fas  accounting for transfers of financial assets  and fas  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  codified as accounting standards update no 
asu  which changes the way entities account for securitizations and special purpose entities 
both statements were effective for us beginning in but did not have an impact on the financial statements 
other recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards no 
technical corrections and improvements  which includes certain corrections to the accounting standards codification and amendments that identify when the use of fair value should be linked to the definition of fair value in topic  fair value measurement 
this update contains conforming amendments to the codification to reflect the measurement and disclosure requirements of topic the amendments in this update that will not have transition guidance are effective for us upon issuance 
the amendments that are subject to the transition guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this new guidance may only affect the way in which we reference and report accounting and reporting standards 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which requires an entity to disclose certain information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
an entity is required to apply the amendments in this update for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have an impact on the financial statements 
the fasb has clarified the scope of asu and proposed to limit the disclosures to derivatives  sale and repurchase agreements and reverse sale and repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and lending arrangements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which provides an entity with the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in a single continuous statement  the entity is required to present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with the total of comprehensive income in that statement 
in the two statement approach  an entity is required to present components of net income and total net income in the statement of net income 
the statement of other comprehensive income should immediately follow the statement of net income and include the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with a total for comprehensive income 
these changes apply to both annual and interim financial statements 
the amendments in asu should be applied retrospectively 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   however accounting standards no 
 issued by the fasb in december  has deferred the effective date of the portions of this update that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
early adoption is permitted 
we do not currently expect the adoption of asu to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which changes the wording used to describe the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   and should be applied prospectively 
we do not currently expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our on going business operations 
our primary exposure includes changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk relates primarily to the variable rate borrowings under our credit facility 
the following discussion of our interest rate swaps see financial derivatives below is based on a change in interest rates 
these changes are hypothetical scenarios used to calibrate potential risk and do not represent our view of future market changes 
as the hypothetical figures discussed below indicate  changes in fair value based on the assumed change in rates generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
at september   we had and million of outstanding term loans and revolver borrowings  respectively  under our credit facility  and million of equipment financing outstanding 
our weighted average effective interest rate was on total debt at september  compared to on total debt outstanding at september  at september   a hypothetical increase in interest rates in effect at that date would have increased annual interest expense by million 
we enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the risks and costs associated with financing activities  as well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
the swap agreements discussed below are contracts to exchange variable rate for fixed interest rate payments over the life of the agreements 
the aggregate fair value of these swaps represented an unrealized loss of million at september  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in interest rates from the level in effect at september   would result in an aggregate realized gain or loss in value of the swaps of less than million or million  respectively  and an aggregate unrealized gain or loss in value of the swaps of approximately million or million  respectively 
financial derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure related to fluctuating cash flows from changes in interest rates 
use of derivative financial instruments in hedging programs subjects us to certain risks  such as market and credit risks 
market risk represents the possibility that the value of the derivative instrument will change 
in a hedging relationship  the change in the value of the derivative is offset to a great extent by the change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
credit risk related to derivatives represents the possibility that the counterparty will not fulfill the terms of the contract 
the notional  or contractual  amount of our derivative financial instruments is used to measure interest to be paid or received and does not represent our exposure due to credit risk 
our current derivative instruments are with large financial counterparties rated highly by nationally recognized credit rating agencies 
we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk related to fluctuating cash flows from interest rate changes by converting a portion of its variable rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings 
as of september   our outstanding interest rate derivative instruments included a a million interest rate swap with interest payments at a fixed rate of  b a million interest rate swap with interest payments at a fixed rate of  and c a million interest rate swap with interest payments at a fixed rate of 
these interest rate swaps expire in april and  as discussed further below  were designated as cash flow hedges until our refinancing 
in addition  on april   we entered into a new interest rate derivative instrument consisting of a million interest rate swap with interest payments at a fixed rate of  commencing on june  this new interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge and amortizes at million per quarter beginning on june  and expires on march  for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we record the effective portions of changes in their fair value  net of taxes  in other comprehensive income 
the effectiveness of the hedges is periodically assessed by management during the lives of the hedges by comparing the current terms of the hedges with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide and through an evaluation of the ability of the counterparties to the hedges to honor their obligations under the hedges 
any ineffective portions of the hedges are recognized in earnings through interest expense and other financing costs 
our refinancing transaction on april  resulted in hedge ineffectiveness on the derivative instruments that expire in april  as the underlying term debt being hedged was repaid before the expiration of the derivative instruments 
this resulted in a million charge to interest expense and other financing costs in the third quarter of for the fair value of the derivative instruments previously recorded as a component of comprehensive loss 
subsequent changes in the fair value of those swaps are also being recognized in interest expense and other financing costs and there was a decline of million in the fair value of the ineffective swaps in the second half of that was recognized as a reduction to interest expense and other financing costs 
we record any differences paid or received on its interest rate hedges as adjustments to interest expense 
the table below presents the combined fair values of the interest rate derivative instruments unrealized losses location on september  september  instrument balance sheet fair value hierarchy dollars in thousands designated interest rate swaps effective accrued expenses  non designated interest rate swaps ineffective accrued expenses level the fair values of the interest rate hedges were determined through the use of pricing models  which utilize verifiable inputs such as market interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals generally referred to as the libor curve for the full terms of the hedge agreements 
these values reflect a level measurement under the applicable fair value hierarchy 
the table below presents the amounts of gain loss on the interest rate derivative instruments recognized in other comprehensive income oci dollars in thousands amount of gain loss recognized in oci net of tax designated interest rate swaps   non designated interest rate swaps reclassified from accumulated oci the table below presents the amounts of gain loss on the interest rate derivative instruments recognized in interest expense and other financing costs amount of gain loss recognized in interest expense non designated interest rate swaps  non designated interest rate swaps reclassified from accumulated oci foreign currency exchange rate risk we have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the united states  which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows 
approximately of our revenues in were derived from sales to customers in canada 
this business is primarily conducted in the local currency 
this exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can adversely affect revenues  net income and cash flows 
we do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk
