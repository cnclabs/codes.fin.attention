as of february   we operated upscale  casual  full service dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark  under the grand lux cafe mark and one under the rocksugar pan asian kitchen mark 
we also operated two bakery production facilities 
the cheesecake factory is an upscale  casual dining concept that offers more than menu items including appetizers  pizza  seafood  steaks  chicken  burgers  pasta  specialty items  salads  sandwiches  omelettes and desserts  including approximately varieties of cheesecake and other baked desserts 
grand lux cafe and rocksugar pan asian kitchen are also upscale  casual dining concepts offering approximately and menu items  respectively 
in contrast to many chain restaurant operations  substantially all of our menu items except certain desserts manufactured at our bakery production facilities are prepared on site at our restaurants using high quality  fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes 
we believe our restaurants are recognized by consumers for offering value with generous food portions at moderate prices 
our restaurants distinctive  contemporary design and decor create a high energy ambiance in a casual setting 
our restaurants typically range in size from  to  interior square feet  provide full liquor service and are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner  as well as sunday brunch 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december st for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal years and each consisted of weeks  while fiscal consisted of weeks 
the estimated impact of the rd week in fiscal in comparison to fiscal was an increase in revenue of approximately million 
while certain expenses increased in direct relationship to additional revenue from the rd week  some expenses are incurred on a calendar month basis 
overview in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending  changes in general economic conditions  public safety conditions  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost and availability of food products  labor and energy  and government regulations 
accordingly  as part of our strategy we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to protect our competitiveness and to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands 
our strategy is driven by our commitment to guest satisfaction and is focused primarily on menu innovation and operational execution to continue to differentiate ourselves from other restaurant concepts  as well as drive competitively strong performance that is sustainable 
financially  we are focused on prudently managing expenses at our restaurants  bakery facilities and corporate support center 
we are also committed to allocating capital in a manner that will maximize profitability and returns 
investing in new restaurant development that meets our return on investment criteria is our top capital allocation priority with a focus on opening our restaurant concepts in premier locations within both existing and new markets 
in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we believe the following are key performance indicators that should be taken into consideration comparable restaurant sales and overall revenue growth 
changes in comparable restaurant sales come from variations in guest traffic  as well as in check average as a result of menu price increases and or changes in menu mix 
our strategy is to grow guest traffic by continuing to offer innovative  high quality menu items that offer guests a wide range of options in terms of flavor  price and value 
in addition  we plan to continue focusing on service and hospitality with the goal of delivering an exceptional guest experience 
our philosophy with regard to menu pricing is to use price increases to help offset key operating costs in a manner that balances protecting both our margins and guest traffic levels 
historically  menu mix generally had a neutral effect on our average check  allowing us to retain the full impact of our menu price increases 
however  as a result of the economic downturn  menu mix became slightly negative due to check management by our guests 
we expect to return more toward the previous neutral pattern as the economy strengthens 
comparable restaurant sales growth  in addition to revenue from new restaurant openings and increases in third party bakery sales  drive our overall revenue growth 
in the future  we expect international locations to also contribute to our revenue growth 

table of contents income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues operating margins 
operating margins are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor  restaurant level occupancy expenses  general and administrative expenses g a and preopening expenses 
our objective is to gradually increase our operating margins by capturing fixed cost leverage from comparable restaurant sales increases  maximizing our purchasing power as our business grows  and operating our restaurants as productively as possible by retaining the efficiencies we gained through the implementation of cost management initiatives 
by efficiently scaling our restaurant and bakery support infrastructure and improving our internal processes  we strive to grow g a expenses at a slower rate than revenue growth over the long term  which should also contribute to operating margin expansion 
return on investment 
return on investment measures our ability to make the best decisions regarding our allocation of capital 
returns are affected by the cost to build restaurants  the level of revenues that each restaurant can deliver and our ability to maximize the profitability of restaurants through operational execution and disciplined cost management 
our objective is to deploy capital in a manner that will maximize our return on investment 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses impairment of assets preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest expense interest income other expense income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal  including approximately million contributed by the rd week  compared to  million for fiscal restaurant revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
the rd week contributed approximately million in restaurant revenues in fiscal comparable sales at the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe restaurants increased by  or million  from fiscal to fiscal the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales calculations in their th month of operation 
at january   there were eight the cheesecake factory restaurants not included in the comparable sales base 
comparable sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants increased from fiscal on a week basis driven by both improved guest traffic and average check 
we implemented effective menu price increases of approximately and during the first and third quarters of fiscal  respectively 
on a weighted average basis  based on the timing of our menu roll outs within each quarter  the cheesecake factory menu included a increase in pricing for fiscal year this increase in menu pricing 
table of contents was partially offset by a menu mix shift due to check management by guests  particularly related to non alcoholic beverage purchases 
inclusive of our summer and winter menu changes  we are targeting an effective price increase of approximately for the first half of fiscal we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
comparable sales at our grand lux cafe restaurants decreased from fiscal year on a week basis driven by a decline in guest traffic  partially offset by an increase in average check 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented an effective menu price increase of approximately 
on a weighted average basis  based on the timing of our menu roll outs within each quarter  the grand lux cafe menu included a increase in pricing for fiscal year this increase in menu pricing was offset by menu mix shifts due to ongoing check management by guests  particularly with regard to their purchase of non alcoholic beverages 
we generally update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
as part of these menu updates  we evaluate the need for price increases based on those operating cost and expense increases of which we are aware or that we can reasonably expect 
while menu price increases can facilitate increased comparable restaurant sales in addition to offsetting margin pressure  we carefully consider all potential price increases in light of the extent to which we believe they will be accepted by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as general economic conditions  inclement weather  timing of holidays  and competitive and other factors  including those referenced in part i  item a  risk factors  of this report can impact comparable sales 
total restaurant operating weeks increased to  in fiscal from the prior year due to the opening of seven new restaurants during the trailing month period 
excluding the impact of the rd week in fiscal  total operating weeks increased to  average sales per restaurant operating week increased approximately to  in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an improvement in both guest traffic and average check 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year due primarily to decreases in warehouse club and national account sales 
we strive to develop and maintain long term  growing relationships with our bakery customers  based largely on our year reputation for producing high quality and creative baked desserts 
however  it is difficult to predict the timing of bakery product shipments and contribution margins on a quarterly basis  as the purchasing plans of our large account customers may fluctuate 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of food  beverage  retail and bakery production supply costs incurred in conjunction with our restaurant and bakery revenues  and excludes depreciation  which is captured separately in depreciation and amortization expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was due to continuing cost pressures from certain commodities  primarily dairy and some general grocery items 
our restaurant menus are among the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  are not overly dependent on a few select commodities 
changes in costs for one commodity can sometimes be counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  dairy  bread and general grocery items 
we attempt to negotiate short term and long term agreements for our principal commodity  supply and equipment requirements  depending on market conditions and expected demand 
however  we are currently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities such as fish and many dairy items excluding cream cheese used in our bakery operations 
consequently  these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products 
we contracted for a substantial portion of our fiscal cream cheese requirements and also purchased cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our contracted amounts 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected menu price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for these commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher during the first three to four months of operations until our management team becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes at the new restaurant 

table of contents labor expenses as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor  including associated fringe benefits  decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to leverage from increased comparable sales and favorable group medical insurance costs  partially offset by higher payroll taxes due to a benefit in fiscal from the federal hiring incentives to restore employment hire act  which resulted in lower employer fica costs in that year 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  common area expenses  insurance  licenses  taxes and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses  which are reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to leverage from increased comparable sales and lower marketing expenses  partially offset by higher year over year expense related to our self insured workers compensation and general liability plans 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  as well as the restaurant field supervision  bakery administrative and corporate support organizations 
as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal due primarily to a lower fiscal accrual for incentive compensation and leverage from increased sales 
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to lower capital investments due to fewer restaurant openings in the past few years  as well as proportionately higher investment during those years in information systems  which have shorter useful lives than most restaurant capital expenditures 
impairment of assets in fiscal  we recorded expense of million  representing reductions to the carrying values of three previously impaired locations  consisting of one grand lux cafe and two the cheesecake factory restaurants 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal if the economic recovery remains slow and or we are unable to implement initiatives to appropriately scale our infrastructure in a timely manner  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies regarding impairment of long lived assets 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we incurred preopening costs to open seven the cheesecake factory restaurants in fiscal compared to opening three the cheesecake factory restaurant during fiscal preopening costs include all costs to relocate and compensate restaurant management employees during the preopening period  costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  and straight line minimum base rent during the build out and in restaurant training periods 
also included in preopening costs are expenses for maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings  the associated temporary housing and other costs necessary to relocate managers in alignment with future restaurant opening and operating needs  and corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant 
interest expense  interest income and other expense income  net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to million recorded in fiscal to unwind an interest rate collar 
in addition  we had no outstanding borrowings under our facility during fiscal as compared to a million average debt balance in the prior year 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt and derivative financial instruments  respectively 
interest expense also included million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with accounting guidance 
interest income increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year due primarily to million of interest income in fiscal related to the favorable resolution of litigation we filed against the irs relating to disallowed employee compensation expense as to tax years and  as described in note of notes to consolidated financials statements in part iv  item of this report 

table of contents we recorded net other expense of million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal this variance primarily relates to changes in the value of our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our executive savings plan esp  a non qualified deferred compensation plan 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to the hire act retention credit in fiscal and the favorable resolution of litigation we filed against the irs relating to disallowed employee compensation expense as to tax years and  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
these decreases were partially offset by non deductible losses in fiscal as compared non taxable gains in fiscal on our investments in variable life insurance use to support our esp 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal restaurant revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
comparable sales at the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe restaurants increased by  or million  from fiscal to fiscal at december   there were three the cheesecake factory restaurants not included in the comparable sales base 
comparable sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants increased from fiscal driven primarily by improved guest traffic 
we implemented effective menu price increases of approximately and during the first and third quarter of fiscal  respectively 
on a weighted average basis  based on the timing of our menu roll outs within each quarter  the cheesecake factory menu included a increase in pricing for fiscal year ended december  this increase in menu pricing was partially offset by menu mix shifts due to ongoing check management by guests  particularly with regard to their purchase of non alcoholic beverages 
comparable sales at our grand lux cafe restaurants increased from fiscal year  driven by improved guest traffic 
we did not implement any price increases in fiscal however  menu price increases made in fiscal had a year over year impact in fiscal on a weighted average basis  the grand lux menu included a increase in pricing for fiscal year ended december  this increase in menu pricing was offset by menu mix shifts due to ongoing check management by guests  particularly with regard to their purchase of non alcoholic beverages 
total restaurant operating weeks increased to  in fiscal from the prior year due to the opening of three new restaurants during the trailing month period 
in addition  average sales per restaurant operating week increased approximately to  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year due principally to the improvement in guest traffic 
bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year due primarily to increases in warehouse club and national account sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was due to cost pressures from certain commodities  primarily dairy and cheese  partially offset by pricing leverage and savings from our cost of sales initiatives  including the development of new menu items with lower food costs  negotiation of more favorable pricing for certain commodities and improvements in our supply chain 
labor expenses as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to overall productivity gains as a result of our operational initiatives  which included aligning the staffing in our restaurants with current sales volumes  leverage from positive comparable sales and lower stock based compensation 
other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to savings from our cost management initiatives  leverage of fixed costs due to positive comparable sales and favorable experience related to our self insured workers compensation and general liability plans 

table of contents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this variance was primarily due to a million charge in fiscal resulting from a change in the amount and structure of the retirement benefit contained in the employment agreement with our chief executive officer  as well as to lower stock based compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to leveraging from positive comparable sales  as well as to lower depreciation expense resulting from the impairment charge we recorded in fiscal discussed below in impairment of assets 
impairment of assets we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of four grand lux cafe restaurants in fiscal no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we incurred preopening costs to open three the cheesecake factory restaurants in fiscal compared to opening one the cheesecake factory restaurant during fiscal interest expense  interest income and other expense income  net interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to lower average outstanding debt balances during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
interest expense included million in both fiscal and to unwind interest rate collars in conjunction with reducing our revolving credit facility balance 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt and derivative financial instruments  respectively 
interest expense also included million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with accounting guidance 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year due primarily to lower invested balances and lower interest rates on those invested balances during fiscal we recorded net other expense of million for fiscal compared to net other income of million for fiscal this variance primarily relates to changes in the value of our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  and the realization in fiscal of million in proceeds from one of these contracts  as well as reductions in other miscellaneous income items 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to deleverage from employment related tax credits on higher pretax income  as well as lower non taxable gains on our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  partially offset by the favorable resolution of our litigation we filed against the irs relating to disallowed employee compensation expense as to tax years and  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
fiscal outlook this discussion contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part iv  item of this report  the risk factors included in part i  item a of this report  and the cautionary statements included throughout this report 
in fiscal  we plan to open as many as seven to eight new restaurants  including one grand lux cafe 
we estimate diluted earnings per share for fiscal will be between and based on the assumption that comparable restaurant sales will increase in a range of between and 
we expect cash capital expenditures in fiscal to range between million and million 
we also plan to continue to use the majority of our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources our corporate financial objectives are to maintain a sufficiently strong and conservative balance sheet to support our operating initiatives and unit growth with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery brands  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations in the current economic environment and through future economic and industry cycles 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan and ongoing maintenance of our restaurants and bakery facilities  as well as investment in our corporate and information technology infrastructures 

table of contents similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while most of our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum base rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
historically  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  debt financing  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities dollar amounts in millions fiscal year cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from exercise of employee stock options repayment on credit facility purchase of treasury stock during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million at january  this decrease was primarily attributable to treasury stock purchases and capital expenditures  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from exercises of employee stock options 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of cash and cash equivalents 
capital expenditures were higher in fiscal compared to fiscal and due to the number of restaurants opened in each year seven  three and one  respectively 
capital expenditures for new restaurants  including locations under development as of each fiscal year end were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal capital expenditures also included million for our existing restaurants  and approximately million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between million and million  net of agreed upon up front cash landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
the amount reflected as additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows may vary from this estimate based on the accounting treatment of each lease see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
our estimate for capital expenditures for fiscal contemplates a net outlay of million to million for as many as seven to eight restaurants expected to be opened during fiscal and estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings 
these amounts are net of estimated collections of up front cash landlord construction contributions 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include million to million for maintenance and capacity additions on our existing restaurants and million to million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
at january   we had no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit facility facility 
availability under the facility is reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit  which are used to support our self insurance programs 
as of january   we had net availability for borrowings of million  based upon a zero outstanding debt balance and million in standby letters of credit 
in addition  our facility limits our cash distributions with respect to our equity interests  such as cash dividends and share repurchases  based on a defined leverage ratio 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt 
during fiscal and  we entered into several zero cost interest rate collars that hedged interest rate variability on a portion of outstanding borrowings on our facility 
during fiscal and  in conjunction with repayments on our facility  we unwound our derivatives at a cost of million in each year 
we had no derivative instruments outstanding at january  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments 
on october   our board of directors increased the authorization to repurchase our common stock by million shares to million shares 
under this authorization  we have cumulatively repurchased a total of million shares at a total cost of million through january  our share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date  does not require us to 
table of contents purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our repurchase authorization and methods 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that during the upcoming months our cash and cash equivalents  combined with expected cash flows provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our capital allocation strategy  including capital expenditures and share repurchases and allow us to consider additional possible capital allocation strategies  such as the initiation of a dividend or the acquisition of other growth vehicles 
as of january   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  amounts in millions payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations leases long term debt purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit represents aggregate minimum lease payments for our restaurant operations  automobiles and certain equipment  including amounts characterized as deemed landlord financing payments in accordance with accounting guidance 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
most of our leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum base rent based on a percentage of sales ranging from to and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
purchasing obligations represent commitments for the purchase of goods and estimated construction commitments  net of agreed upon up front landlord construction contributions 
amounts exclude agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
represents liability for uncertain tax positions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of income taxes 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset or lease term  whichever is shorter 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we regularly review any restaurants that are cash flow negative for the previous four quarters to determine if impairment testing is warranted 
at any given time  we may be monitoring a small number of locations  and future impairment charges could be required if individual restaurant performance does not improve 
we have determined that our asset group for impairment testing is comprised of the assets and liabilities of each of our individual restaurants  as this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
we have identified leasehold improvements as the primary asset because it is the most significant component of our restaurant assets  is the principal asset from which our restaurants derive their cash flow generating capacity and has the longest remaining useful life 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair values 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment based on our experience and knowledge 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in the economic environment  real estate market conditions and capital spending decisions 
in fiscal  we recorded expense of million  representing additional reductions to the carrying values of three previously impaired locations  consisting of one grand lux cafe and two the cheesecake factory restaurants 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against four grand lux cafe locations 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal if the economic recovery remains slow and or we are unable to implement initiatives to appropriately scale our infrastructure in a timely manner  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we evaluate each lease to determine its appropriate classification as an operating or capital lease for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the initial lease term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is recorded as incurred to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we expend cash for leasehold improvements and ff e to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises 
generally a portion of the leasehold improvements and building costs are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against our future minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space and the lease agreement  amounts paid for structural components are recorded during the construction period as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions are recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction  we perform an analysis on the leases for which the structural cost was initially recorded to construction in progress to determine if they qualify for sale leaseback treatment 
for those qualifying leases  the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress are removed and the difference is reclassified to either prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
if the lease does not qualify for sale leaseback treatment  the deemed landlord financing liability is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
gift card revenue recognition we recognize a liability upon the sale of our gift cards and recognize revenue when these gift cards are redeemed in our restaurants or on our website 
based on our historical gift card redemption patterns  we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote  which is referred to as breakage 
breakage is recognized in proportion to historical redemption trends and is classified as revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
utilizing this method  we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption 
if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates  actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded 
self insurance liability we retain the financial responsibility for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  employment practices  employee health benefits and other insurable risks 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but 
table of contents not yet reported to us ibnr as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgment regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim exposure for many of our programs and for aggregate exposure on our employee health benefits program 
the estimated amounts receivable from our third party insurers under this coverage are recorded in other receivables 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr amounts as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option grants  which requires the use of subjective assumptions  including the volatility of our common stock price and the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options prior to exercise 
additionally  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to stock options  restricted shares and restricted share units in determining the amount of stock based compensation expense for each period 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect our results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we update our estimates  which  in turn  may result in adjustments to our effective tax rate 
we generally file our income tax returns within nine to ten months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we account for uncertain tax positions under financial accounting standards board guidance  which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments relating to the amounts  timing and likelihood of resolution 
our actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for a summary of new accounting standards 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our operating margins depend on  among other things  our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities such as fish and many dairy items excluding cream cheese used in our bakery operations 
consequently  these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
our staff members are subject to various minimum wage requirements 
we operate in many states  including california  where the minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum and in such states our staff members receive minimum compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
there have been and may be additional minimum wage increases in excess of federal minimum wage implemented in various jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate 
minimum wage increases may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from 
table of contents time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will generate increases in comparable restaurant and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations in that our restaurant sales are typically higher during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year  as well as during the christmas holiday season 
historically  our highest levels of revenues for our established restaurants occur in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
approximately of our restaurants are located in or near retail centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating in our restaurants and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs and operating inefficiencies 
our bakery revenue is seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday related orders and also may vary significantly due to the timing and or size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
see item a risk factors our business is somewhat seasonal  which could result in fluctuations in our financial performance from quarter to quarter and year to year and adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could unfavorably impact our restaurant sales 
as a result of these factors  our financial results for any single quarter or for periods of less than a year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved on an annual basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from interest rate changes on our funded debt 
this exposure relates to the component of the interest rate on our million revolving credit facility facility that is indexed to three month libor 
as of january  we had no debt outstanding under the facility 
therefore  we had no exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our funded debt at year end fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt 
we are also subject to market risk related to our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  to the extent these investments are not equivalent to the related liability 
in addition  because changes in these investments are not taxable  the full impact of gains or losses affects net income 
based on balances at january  and december   a hypothetical decline in the market value of our deferred compensation asset and related liability would not have impacted income before income taxes 
however  net income would have declined by million at both dates 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
we attempt to negotiate short term and long term agreements for our principal commodity  supply and equipment requirements  depending on market conditions and expected demand 
however  we are currently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities such as fish and many dairy items excluding cream cheese used in our bakery operations 
consequently  these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from multiple qualified suppliers  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
in addition  we may have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary menu items  in response to food commodity price increases 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
