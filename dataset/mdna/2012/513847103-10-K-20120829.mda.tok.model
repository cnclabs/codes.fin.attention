item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our fiscal year begins on july and ends on june unless otherwise noted  references to year pertain to our fiscal year  for example  refers to fiscal  which is the period from july  to june  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
overview business overview lancaster colony corporation is a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products focusing primarily on specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets 
we also manufacture and market candles for the food  drug and mass markets 
although not material to our consolidated operations  we are also engaged in the distribution of various products  including glassware and candles  to commercial markets 
our operations are organized in two reportable segments specialty foods and glassware and candles 
the sales of each segment are predominately domestic 
in recent years  our strategy has shifted away from operating businesses in a variety of industries towards emphasizing the growth and success we have achieved in our specialty foods segment 
in  approximately of our consolidated net sales and effectively all of our operating income were derived from the specialty foods segment 
for perspective  in  our specialty foods segment comprised approximately and of our reported consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
we intend to periodically reassess the strategic fit and contribution of our remaining nonfood operations in light of market conditions  capital needs and other factors 
our current strategy focuses our efforts on the most profitable part of our business and minimizes the amount of financial and management resources devoted to our nonfood operations 
we view our food operations as having the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as leading retail market positions in several branded products with a high quality perception  a broad customer base in both retail and foodservice accounts  well regarded culinary expertise among foodservice accounts  recognized leadership in foodservice product development  experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions  and historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities 
our goal is to grow our specialty foods retail and foodservice business over time by leveraging the strength of our retail brands to increase current product sales and introduce new products  growing our foodservice sales through the strength of our reputation in product development and quality  and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria 
within retail markets  our specialty foods segment utilizes numerous branded products to support growth and maintain market competitiveness 
we place great emphasis on our product innovation and development efforts so as to enhance growth by providing distinctive new products meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers 

table of contents our foodservice sales primarily consist of products sold to restaurant chains 
over the long term  we have experienced broad based growth in our foodservice sales  as we build on our strong reputation for product development and quality 
we expect that part of our future growth in the specialty foods segment will result from acquisitions 
we continue to review potential acquisitions that we believe will provide good complements to our existing product lines  enhance our gross margins or offer good expansion opportunities in a manner that fits our overall goals 
as has occasionally been required to support future growth opportunities  we have historically made substantial capital investments to support our existing food operations  such as the construction of a new frozen yeast roll facility in horse cave  kentucky that began operations in and was significantly expanded through a project that was completed in june this facility has helped accommodate potential future sales growth and also provided greater manufacturing efficiencies 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that our total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
summary of results consolidated net sales reached approximately  million during  increasing by approximately as compared to prior year net sales of  million  driven by growth coming from our specialty foods segment  as partially offset by a decline in glassware and candles segment sales 
the specialty foods segment s increase reflected higher retail and foodservice sales 
the decrease in sales of the glassware and candles segment primarily reflected lower candle volumes 
gross margin decreased to approximately million from the prior year comparable total of million 
comparatively higher raw material costs  as well as a less favorable sales mix and higher freight costs within the specialty foods segment  contributed to the lower gross margin 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under cdsoa 
in  we received approximately million under cdsoa  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in for a more detailed discussion of cdsoa  see the subcaption other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
net income totaled approximately million in  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in net income in totaled approximately million  or per diluted share 
looking forward factors that will affect our future performance include the impact of several recently introduced retail food products  as well as the expansion of existing product lines with current customers or into new geographic markets 
we will also continue to review acquisition opportunities within the specialty foods segment that are consistent with our growth strategy and represent good value or otherwise provide significant strategic benefits 
however  unsettled economic conditions affecting consumer and retailer buying patterns  as well as recent drought conditions adversely affecting domestic crop yields  are among the many influences that may impact our ability to improve sales and operating margins in the coming year 
within our specialty foods segment  we anticipate that our overall material input costs should begin the year somewhat below the comparable levels 
it is possible that future changes in the economy and regulatory environment could cause increases in these costs 
to help offset or stabilize the impact of such increases  we have historically pursued various pricing actions and operational strategies that we believe will aid our future results 
for example  as part of our cost reduction efforts  we consolidated our wilson  new york and atlanta  georgia production operations into our other existing facilities in the second quarter of and early  respectively 
further  the expansion of our frozen roll capacity has improved  and is expected to further improve  production throughput 
we are also continuing to limit some of our exposure to volatile swings in food commodity costs through a structured purchasing program for certain future requirements 

table of contents with respect to our glassware and candles segment  in we experienced lower sales levels  especially for holiday products  as some lower margin business was not retained 
looking forward to influences  we expect growth in our seasonal sales and higher production levels 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of commodity costs  see the impact of inflation section of this md a below 
in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
we will continue to reassess our allocation of capital periodically to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to our shareholders  whether through share repurchases or cash dividends  including special dividends  if appropriate 
review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles net sales and gross margin year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods glassware and candles total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased by approximately to approximately  million from the prior year total of approximately  million 
in  increased sales within the specialty foods segment were partially offset by lower sales within the glassware and candles segment 
the specialty foods segment s increase reflected higher retail and foodservice sales 
higher pricing totaled approximately of segment net sales for retail sales also reflected the incremental benefit from some recently introduced food products 
the segment s foodservice sales also increased on expanded volumes associated with programs among existing customers 
the decrease in sales of the glassware and candles segment primarily reflected lower candle volumes 
in  we exited certain lower margin business  including some seasonal candle programs 
higher pricing helped to offset some of these declines 
consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased by approximately over the total of approximately  million  which reflected growth in both operating segments 
the specialty foods segment s increase reflected higher foodservice sales  which were partially offset by lower retail sales 
the foodservice sales increase resulted from both higher pricing and new programs with some large restaurant chains 
the decline in retail sales was influenced by the exiting of less profitable dressing lines midway through  the loss of product placement for certain produce dips at one customer and generally weak retail market conditions 
the increase in sales of the glassware and candles segment primarily reflected higher candle volumes from product placement into new accounts that began in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately in compared with in and in gross margin percentages in the specialty foods segment declined in  reflecting a somewhat less favorable sales mix  as well as comparatively higher costs for a wide variety of raw materials especially for soybean oil and flour and freight  as partially offset by higher pricing 
in the glassware and candles segment  gross margin percentages improved slightly primarily due to the impact of higher pricing and an improved sales mix 
these factors were somewhat mitigated by higher wax costs  lower sales and reduced production levels 
for  as a percentage of net sales  higher material costs were estimated to have impacted gross margin comparisons by approximately 
in the specialty foods segment  gross margin percentages declined in  reflecting broadly higher ingredient and freight costs and a less favorable sales mix 
gross margin percentages in the glassware and candles segment declined in due to higher wax costs and  to a lesser extent  lower production volumes

vs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expense as a percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses for totaled approximately million and increased as compared with the total of million  which had increased from the total of million 
the increase was influenced by the higher levels of food sales 
for  higher sales based expenses  increased compensation expense and greater consumer directed marketing costs contributed to the overall increase  although as a percentage of net sales the expenses were comparable to restructuring and impairment charges in  we closed our dressings and sauces manufacturing operation located in wilson  new york 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million million after taxes within the specialty foods segment 
this closure was essentially complete at december  we do not expect any other costs or cash expenditures related to this closure

table of contents other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa provides for the distribution of monies collected by us customs from anti dumping cases to qualifying domestic producers 
our reported cdsoa receipts totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cdsoa remittances have related to certain candles being imported from the people s republic of china 
cdsoa provisions for remittances apply only to duties collected on products imported prior to october accordingly  we may receive some level of annual distributions for an undetermined period of years in the future as the monies collected that relate to entries filed prior to october are administratively finalized by us customs 
without further legislative action  we expect these distributions will eventually cease 
cases have been brought in us courts challenging certain aspects of cdsoa 
in two separate cases  the us court of international trade cit ruled that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed both cit decisions and the us supreme court did not hear either case 
this allowed the appellate court decisions to stand  but other legal challenges to cdsoa are still pending 
we are unable to determine  at this time  what the ultimate outcome of other litigation will be  and it is possible that further legal action  potential additional changes in the law and other factors could affect the amount of funds available for distribution  including funds relating to entries prior to october accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of future distributions  if any  we may receive 
any change in cdsoa distributions could affect our earnings and cash flow

contribution from higher pricing was 
table of contents approximately of net sales 
the segment s foodservice net sales rose approximately in on increased volumes  particularly from new programs with existing large chain restaurants  and higher pricing 
retail net sales declined approximately in as influenced by the prior year rationalization of some product lines associated with the mid year closing of one of our dressing facilities 
also  sales of produce dips declined  reflecting a weaker category and the loss of placement for certain products at one of our customers 
mitigating these declines were increased retail sales of frozen rolls and the success of several recently introduced products 
operating income of the specialty foods segment in totaled approximately million  a decrease from the level of million 
the level decreased from the record level of million 
the decrease reflected a somewhat less favorable sales mix  as well as comparatively higher costs for a wide variety of raw materials especially for soybean oil and flour and freight  as partially offset by higher pricing 
we estimate that higher material costs in adversely affected comparative results by approximately of segment net sales 
the decrease reflected broadly higher ingredient and freight costs  a less favorable sales mix and increased marketing costs 
we estimate that higher material costs in adversely affected the segment s comparative results by approximately of net sales 
segment review glassware and candles glassware and candles segment net sales totaled approximately million during  as compared to million in and million in the decrease primarily reflected lower candle volumes 
in  we exited certain lower margin business  including some seasonal candle programs 
higher pricing helped to offset some of the volume declines 
the increase reflected higher candle sales volumes  mainly product placement into new accounts that began in the fourth quarter of the segment recorded operating income of approximately million in  million in and million in the decrease reflected higher wax costs  lower sales and reduced production levels 
these factors were somewhat mitigated by modestly higher pricing and an improved sales mix 
in  despite the benefits of achieving higher sales volumes  operating results were adversely affected by higher wax costs and  to a lesser extent  lower production volumes 
we estimate that higher wax costs in the glassware and candles segment adversely affected the segment s comparative results in by over of net sales  and by approximately of net sales compared to corporate expenses the corporate expenses totaled approximately million as compared to million in and million in the decrease reflected lower expenses related to real estate available for sale 
the increase in expenses in from related to increased professional fees and personnel related costs 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
our balance sheet retained fundamental financial strength during  and we ended the year with approximately million in cash and equivalents  along with shareholders equity of approximately million and no debt 
under our unsecured revolving credit facility  we may borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time 
loans may be used for general corporate purposes 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at june  at june   we had approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding  which reduced the amount available for borrowing on the unsecured revolving credit facility 
the facility expires in april  and all outstanding amounts are then due and payable 
interest is variable based upon formulas tied to libor or an alternative base rate defined in the credit agreement  at our option 
we must also pay facility fees that are tied to our then applicable consolidated leverage ratio 
based on the 
table of contents long term nature of this facility  when we have outstanding borrowings under this facility  we will classify the outstanding balance as long term debt 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  asset sales and acquisitions  and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage 
at june   we were in compliance with all applicable provisions and covenants of the facility  and we exceeded the requirements of the financial covenants by substantial margins 
we currently expect to remain in compliance with the facility s covenants for the foreseeable future 
a default under the facility could accelerate the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness and limit our access to additional credit available under the facility 
such an event could require curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases  reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans  or otherwise impact our ability to meet our obligations when due 
at june   we were not aware of any event that would constitute a default under the facility 
we believe that internally generated funds and our existing balances in cash and equivalents  in addition to our currently available bank credit arrangements  should be adequate to meet our foreseeable cash requirements 
if we were to borrow outside of our credit facility under current market terms  our average interest rate may increase significantly and have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
for additional information regarding our credit facility  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
provided by operating activities used in investing activities used in financing activities our cash flows for the years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided by operating activities in totaled approximately million  a decrease of as compared with the prior year total of million  which increased from the total of million 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities reflected relative changes in working capital  particularly accounts receivable  as well as lower net income 
the increase reflected favorable changes in working capital  especially within accounts receivable  inventory and other current assets  as partially offset by the decrease in net income 
most notably  consolidated inventories declined approximately million in  despite broadly higher material costs  due to a reduced need for building seasonal inventories 
cash used in investing activities totaled approximately million in  million in and million for the decrease in cash used in investing activities reflected a lower level of capital expenditures 
the increase reflected a higher level of capital expenditures in due to the expansion of our frozen yeast roll facility in kentucky  which was substantially completed in june capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  compared to million in and million in capital spending allocations during by segment approximated for specialty foods  for glassware and candles and for corporate 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that our total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
financing activities used net cash totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities was due to a lower level of share repurchases  as partially offset by an increase in dividend payments 
the increase reflected a higher level of share repurchases  lower proceeds from the exercise of stock awards and a lower cash overdraft balance 
the total payment for cash dividends for the year ended june  was approximately million 
the dividend payout rate for was per share as compared to per share during  and per share in this past fiscal year marked the th consecutive year 
table of contents in which our dividend rate was increased 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our board approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares in november approximately  shares from this authorization remained authorized for future purchase at june  the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 
our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material 
we are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits  taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of business 
we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments we do not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as variable interest entities  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures 
we have various contractual obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june  dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other noncurrent liabilities as reflected on consolidated balance sheet total operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of raw materials  supplies  services  and property  plant and equipment 
this amount does not include approximately million of other noncurrent liabilities recorded on the balance sheet  which consist of the underfunded pension liability  other post employment benefit obligations  tax liabilities  noncurrent workers compensation obligations  deferred compensation and interest on deferred compensation 
these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation in recent years  we have been exposed to significant fluctuations in certain manufacturing input costs  including materials such as food commodities and paraffin wax 
in  we experienced comparatively higher costs for a wide variety of raw materials especially for soybean oil  flour and paraffin wax 
in  
table of contents we experienced comparatively higher ingredient costs including for soybean oil  dairy products  sugar  eggs and paraffin wax 
we estimate that higher material costs adversely affected our and results by approximately and of net sales  respectively 
we also experienced higher distribution costs  which were  in part  influenced by higher diesel costs 
entering  we expect that our overall material costs may compare somewhat favorably  at least over the first six months of the year 
over the course of and  we were generally able to adjust various selling prices of food products to partially offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments generally lagged the increase in our costs  having a net negative impact on our and operating margins 
our operating results will also be impacted by our ability to offset any resumption of higher input costs through pricing adjustments with our customers 
we also attempt to minimize the exposure to increased costs through our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have typically not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances  historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products and may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer and consumer demand 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 

table of contents long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually at april  through asset impairment testing  as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index  yield curve analysis results from our actuaries based on expected cash flows of our plans  and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
any changes in that funded status caused by subsequent plan revaluations are recognized through comprehensive income 
we may also experience future plan settlements or curtailments having unanticipated effects on operating results

the entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying value 
asu will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we will adopt this guidance in fiscal  but because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed  the amended standards will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements
