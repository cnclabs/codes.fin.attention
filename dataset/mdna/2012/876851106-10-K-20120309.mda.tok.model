item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in this report 
our business taylor capital group  inc the company  we  us  or our is a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago  and we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank the bank

we were formed in and acquired cole taylor bank in we provide a range of products and services primarily to closely held commercial customers and their owner operators in the chicago area

our primary businesses are commercial banking  asset based lending  mortgage banking services and retail banking

our commercial and industrial lending group operates primarily in the chicago area 
in addition  through offices located across the united states  we also offer asset based financing through cole taylor business capital including revolving lines of credit supported by receivables and inventory and term loans supported by equipment and real estate 
in addition  we originate  sell and service mortgage loans through cole taylor mortgage 
we are qualified to do business in states  three of which were added in loan production is sourced through a national broker network  retail offices across the united states and from the bank s banking centers branches  located in the chicago area 
this line of business  launched in early  is a source of noninterest fee income and provides earnings and geographic diversification 
in addition to our lending activities  we offer deposit products  such as checking  savings and money market accounts  as well as time deposits through nine banking centers located in the chicago area and through our on line banking application 
we also cross sell products and services to the owners and executives of our business customers to help them meet their personal financial goals  including personal credit 
in addition to commercial clients  we provide deposit and credit services to our community based customers  typically individuals and small  local businesses located near one of our banking centers 
we use third party providers to offer investment management and brokerage services 
our commercial and retail banking and deposit products are delivered by a single operations area located in rosemont  illinois 
our mortgage unit is based in ann arbor  michigan 
we have two separate and discrete operating segments  banking and mortgage banking 

table of contents our strategy our ongoing strategy to increase stockholder value is a two pronged approach  which we generally refer to as our fix and grow strategy 
this strategy focuses on remediating the asset quality issues brought on by the downturn of the chicago area real estate market in recent years  while simultaneously growing and diversifying our earnings 
this strategy has been in place since early when we first embarked on repositioning the bank as a commercial and industrial lender to closely held businesses in the chicago area 
at that time  we began shifting away from industries and sectors that we no longer considered economically desirable and reducing areas of significant risk concentration  such as in residential real estate construction and land loans 
grow strategy our commercial and industrial banking business was bolstered and expanded in early with the addition of new leadership and more than experienced commercial bankers 
the foundation of this business is built on the belief that the owners of closely held businesses value a long term relationship with a quality banker who provides innovative advice  creative ideas and an understanding of the challenges and opportunities these owners face 
for this reason  we believe our relationship managers  as well as our customers access to our senior management  are the most important products that we offer 
today  our commercial and industrial banking team is our strategic backbone  and approximately of the loan portfolio is made up of commercial and industrial loans  including owner occupied real estate  spread across many industry sectors 
to complement and extend our growth strategy  in we added new  experienced leadership  as well as sales and lending capability in asset based lending  formed cole taylor business capital  and thus expanded our product set and geographic reach 
since inception  this unit has added over new clients 
this unit increased loans outstanding by million in this business line provides us with additional geographic diversity given its nationwide reach from nine offices spread across the us we expect this business will continue to grow  adding additional offices to boost coverage and increase production 
in january  we established cole taylor mortgage by hiring experienced leadership with extensive mortgage banking knowledge and relationships 
the addition of a mortgage lending operation provided us with further geographic diversity and a significant source of fee income  both important strategic considerations 
in  cole taylor mortgage funded more than billion in mortgage loans  generating more than million in fee income  and had positive operating profit revenue less noninterest expense 
it is expected that this unit s origination volumes will increase as operations grow 
we anticipate further growth in loan production to result from the opening of additional retail offices  as well as through our growing network of relationships with mortgage brokers and the addition of new products 
in addition  in we began to diversify the mortgage banking revenue stream 
we began retaining some of our originated mortgages in our portfolio rather than selling them in the secondary market 
we also began retaining servicing on some originated loans  as well as purchasing mortgage servicing rights from third parties 
fix strategy with the downturn of the chicago area real estate market that began in late  and because of prior years when the bank was more heavily concentrated in real estate construction and land development lending  we augmented our growth strategy with a focus on asset quality remediation 
since  we added significant workout capabilities to support that effort  retained additional experienced asset quality remediation consultants and overhauled our loan operations 
as necessitated by the deterioration in the residential real estate construction and land loan portfolio due to economic conditions in the chicago area  a significant focus of the asset quality remediation strategy has been reducing our residential construction and land portfolio 
at the beginning of  this portfolio was approximately million and at year end was approximately million  an reduction 
this 
table of contents reduction was largely accomplished through loan resolutions and asset sales 
as this exposure has decreased over time and as other parts of the chicago commercial real estate market have also weakened  we directed our expanded workout resources to include other areas of the bank s loan portfolio that have shown the most propensity for losses  including commercial construction and land loans  loans to banks and bank holding companies and other categories of commercial real estate loans 
results our fix and grow strategy is showing sustainable results 
nonperforming loans have dropped to approximately million at december   with an allowance coverage ratio over  and credit costs provision for loan losses and nonperforming asset expense have declined 
the repositioning of the balance sheet away from a focus on real estate loans and the addition of our two national businesses has expanded our revenue streams and provided a stronger  more diverse balance sheet 
we continued planned actions in to reduce our cost of funds  significantly increasing core deposits and modifying or terminating certain repurchase agreements and other advances early in order to shift funding sources to lower cost alternatives 
improvements in revenue and credit quality  combined with our belief that our profitability is sustainable  supported the reversal of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset in to further support our strategy  in we also improved our product and processing capabilities by upgrading our core processing system  which will allow us to expand our product offerings  enhance customer service and further complement the other improvements in infrastructure that we have made in the past four years 
competition we encounter intense competition for all of our products and services  including substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in obtaining loan customers in the chicago area 
we also experience strong competition in the pricing of our products and services  including interest rates paid on deposits  interest rates charged on loans  as well as credit terms and underwriting criteria  residential mortgage origination fees charged and other professional services 
our principal competitors are numerous and include other commercial banks  both locally and nationally  savings and loan associations  mutual funds  money market funds  finance companies  credit unions  mortgage companies  the united states government  private issuers of debt obligations and suppliers of other investment alternatives  such as securities firms 
we may also face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size  limited banking center network and narrower product offerings 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than us and have access to greater financial and other resources 
in addition  many of our non bank competitors are not subject to all of the same federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and federally insured banks or the state regulations governing state chartered banks 
as a result  our non bank competitors may have advantages over us in providing some services 
employees together with the bank  we had full time employees as of december  none of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
supervision and regulation the following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework that applies to us and cole taylor bank  our banking subsidiary 
it does not describe all of the statutes  regulations  regulatory policies and agreements that apply or restate all of the requirements of those that are described 
the descriptions of  and references to  the statutes  regulations and agreements below do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statute  regulation  policy or agreement 
see the discussion captioned our business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate under item ia 
risk factors  which follows in this report 

table of contents overview financial institutions  their holding companies and their affiliates are highly regulated both at the federal and state levels 
financial institution regulation and supervision is intended for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance fund dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and the banking system as a whole  and not necessarily for the protection of a bank or a bank holding company s stockholders or creditors 
the banking regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory  regulatory and enforcement powers over the company  as a regulated bank holding company  and over the bank  as a regulated subsidiary depository institution 
as a result  the growth and earnings performance of the company is affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of the applicable bank regulatory authorities 
as a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended bhc act  we are regulated and supervised by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve 
the bank  an illinois state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system  is regulated by both the illinois department of financial and professional regulation idfpr and the federal reserve 
the bank is required to file periodic reports with both agencies and is subject to periodic examination by both the idfpr and federal reserve 
the bank also accepts deposits which are insured by the fdic  and therefore it is also subject to supervision by the fdic 
in addition  pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  the fdic has backup enforcement authority over an insured depository institution holding company  such as the company  if the conduct or threatened conduct of such holding company poses a risk to the dif 
financial regulatory reform on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act into law 
the dodd frank act represents a sweeping reform of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions and capital markets in the united states  certain aspects of which are described below in more detail 
the dodd frank act creates new federal governmental entities responsible for overseeing different aspects of the us financial services industry  including identifying emerging systemic risks 
it also shifts certain authorities and responsibilities among federal financial institution regulators  including the supervision of holding company affiliates and the regulation of consumer financial services and products 
in particular some of which are discussed in more detail below  and among other things  the dodd frank act creates a bureau of consumer financial protection authorized to regulate providers of consumer credit  savings  payment and other consumer financial products and services  narrows the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws enjoyed by national banks and federal savings associations and expands the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation  imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies and subjects certain activities  including interstate mergers and acquisitions  to heightened capital conditions  repealed the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting the financial institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts  significantly expands underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by family residential real property  creates a financial stability oversight council as part of a regulatory structure for identifying emerging systemic risks and improving interagency cooperation  provides for enhanced regulation of advisers to private funds and of the derivatives markets  enhances oversight of credit rating agencies  
table of contents changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminated the ceiling and size of the dif  and increased the floor applicable to the size of the dif  and prohibits banking agency requirements tied to credit ratings 
numerous provisions of the dodd frank act are required to be implemented through rulemaking by the appropriate federal regulatory agencies 
some of the required regulations have been issued and some have been released for public comment  but many have yet to be released in any form 
furthermore  while the reforms primarily target systemically important financial service providers  their influence is expected to filter down in varying degrees to smaller institutions over time 
management of the company and bank will continue to evaluate the effect of these changes  however  in many respects  the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act will not be fully known for years  and no current assurance may be given that the dodd frank act  or any other new legislative changes  will not have a negative impact on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company and the bank 
the increasing regulatory emphasis on capital we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal and state banking agencies noted above 
failure to meet regulatory capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action described below  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting policies 
our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to judgments by the regulators regarding qualitative components  risk weightings and other factors 
while capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both holding companies and depository institutions  its role is becoming fundamentally more important in the wake of the financial crisis 
not only will capital requirements increase as a result of the dodd frank act  but the type of instruments that constitute capital will also change and  after a three year phase in period beginning in january  bank holding companies will have to hold capital under rules as stringent as those for insured depository institutions 
moreover  the actions of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors  to reassess the nature and uses of capital in connection with an initiative called basel iii  discussed below  will have a significant impact on the capital requirements applicable to us bank holding companies and depository institutions 
required capital levels 
the dodd frank act mandates the federal reserve to establish minimum capital levels for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions 
the components of tier capital will be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
as a result  the proceeds of trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may  by bank holding companies with less than billion of assets 
as the company has assets of less than billion  it will be able to maintain its trust preferred proceeds as tier capital but it will have to comply with new capital mandates in other respects  and it will not be able to raise tier capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities 
under current federal regulations  the bank is subject to  and  after the phase in period  the company will be subject to  the following minimum capital standards a leverage requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets of for the most highly rated banks with a minimum requirement of at least for all others  and a risk based capital requirement consisting of a minimum ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets of 
for this 
table of contents purpose  tier capital consists primarily of common stock  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less intangible assets other than certain loan servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships 
total capital consists primarily of tier capital plus tier capital  which includes other non permanent capital items  such as certain other debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as tier capital  and a portion of the bank s allowance for loan and lease losses 
at december   our leverage ratio was  our tier capital ratio was and our total capital ratio was 
the capital requirements described above are minimum requirements 
federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements 
for example  a banking organization that is well capitalized may qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities may qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications  and may accept brokered deposits 
under the capital regulations of the federal reserve  in order to be well capitalized  a banking organization must maintain a ratio of total capital to total risk weighted assets of or greater  a ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets of or greater and a ratio of tier capital to total assets of or greater 
the federal reserve s guidelines also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio deducting all intangibles in evaluating proposals for expansion or to engage in new activity 
higher capital levels may also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations 
for example  the federal reserve s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  or the risks posed by concentrations of credit  nontraditional activities or securities trading activities 
further  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions ie  tier capital less all intangible assets  well above the minimum levels 
it is important to note that certain provisions of the dodd frank act and basel iii  discussed below  will ultimately establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies  will require more capital to be held in the form of common stock and will disallow certain funds from being included in a tier capital determination 
once fully implemented  these provisions may represent regulatory capital requirements which are meaningfully more stringent than those outlined above 
basel iii 
the current risk based capital guidelines that apply to the bank and will apply to the company are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors  as implemented by the us federal banking agencies on an interagency basis 
in  the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase in capital standards based on a second capital accord  referred to as basel ii  for large or core international banks generally defined for us purposes as having total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more 
basel ii emphasized internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
on september   the group of governors and heads of supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee on banking supervision  announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations in the united states and around the world  known as basel iii 
the agreement is currently supported by the us federal banking agencies 
as agreed to  basel iii is intended to be fully phased in on a global basis on january  basel iii requires  among other things a new required ratio of minimum common equity equal to of total assets plus a capital conservation buffer of  
table of contents an increase in the minimum required amount of tier capital from the current level of of total assets to of total assets  and an increase in the minimum required amount of total capital  from the current level of to including attributable to the capital conservation buffer 
the purpose of the conservation buffer to be phased in from january until january  is to ensure that banks maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress 
there will also be a required countercyclical buffer to achieve the broader goal of protecting the banking sector from periods of excess aggregate credit growth 
pursuant to basel iii  certain deductions  including minority interests in financial institutions  mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax asset from timing differences  would be deducted in increasing percentages beginning january   and would be fully deducted from common equity by january  the basel iii agreement calls for national jurisdictions to implement the new requirements beginning january  at that time  the us federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve  will be expected to have implemented appropriate changes to incorporate the basel iii concepts into us capital adequacy standards 
although it is likely that the countercyclical buffer will apply only to larger institutions  it is not yet clear what portions of basel iii will apply to the bank 
emergency economic stabilization act of on october   president bush signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  giving the united states department of the treasury ust authority to take certain actions to restore liquidity and stability to the us banking markets 
based upon its authority under the eesa  a number of temporary emergency programs were announced and implemented including the ust s capital purchase program cpp 
pursuant to this program  the ust  on behalf of the us government  purchased preferred stock  along with warrants to purchase common stock  from certain financial institutions  including bank holding companies  savings and loan holding companies and banks or savings associations not controlled by a holding company 
the terms of the preferred stock purchased by the ust included a dividend rate of per year  until the fifth anniversary of the ust s purchase  and a dividend rate of thereafter 
during the time the ust holds securities purchased pursuant to the cpp  participating financial institutions are required to comply with certain i provisions regarding executive compensation paid to senior executives and certain other employees and ii corporate governance disclosure and certification requirements 
participation in the cpp also imposes certain restrictions upon a financial institution s ability to pay dividends to its common stockholders and on its stock repurchase activities 
as described further elsewhere in this report  we elected to participate in the cpp  and on november   we issued and sold senior preferred stock to the ust  which generated million of proceeds to the company 
pursuant to the terms of the cpp  and subject to the consent requirements described in the next sentence  while any of our senior preferred stock issued under the cpp is outstanding  we may pay dividends on our common stock  provided that all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the senior preferred stock are fully paid 
prior to november   unless our senior preferred stock has been redeemed or the ust has transferred all of the senior preferred stock to third parties  we need the consent of the ust before paying any dividends on our common stock 
the company general 
the company  as the sole shareholder of the bank  is a bank holding company 
we are a registered bank holding company under the bhc act and illinois law 
in addition to supervision and regulation  the bhc act also governs the activities that are permissible to bank holding companies and their affiliates and permits the federal reserve  in certain circumstances  to issue cease and desist orders and other enforcement 
table of contents actions against bank holding companies and their non banking affiliates to correct and curtail unsafe or unsound banking practices 
under the dodd frank act and longstanding federal reserve policy  bank holding companies are required to act as a source of financial strength to each of their subsidiaries pursuant to which such holding companies may be required to commit financial resources to support such subsidiaries in circumstances when  absent such requirements  they might not otherwise do so 
the bhc act further regulates holding company activities  including requirements and limitations relating to capital  transactions with officers  directors and affiliates  securities issuances  dividend payments  inter affiliate liabilities  extensions of credit and expansion through mergers and acquisitions 
the gramm leach bliley act of significantly amended the bhc act 
the amendments  among other things  allow certain qualifying bank holding companies that elect treatment as financial holding companies to engage in activities that are financial in nature and that explicitly include the underwriting and sale of insurance 
the company has not elected to be treated as a financial holding company and accordingly we generally must limit our activities to banking activities and activities that are closely related to banking 
acquisitions  activities and change in control 
the primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks 
the bhc act generally requires the prior approval of the federal reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company 
subject to certain conditions including deposit concentration limits established by the bhc act and the dodd frank act  the federal reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states 
in approving interstate acquisitions  the federal reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies and state laws that require that the target bank has been in existence for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
furthermore  in accordance with the dodd frank act  as of july   bank holding companies must be well capitalized in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions 
for a discussion of the capital requirements  see the increasing regulatory emphasis on capital above 
the bhc act generally prohibits the company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking  managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries 
this general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions 
the principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in  and to own shares of companies engaged in  certain businesses found by the federal reserve prior to november  to be so closely related to banking 
as to be a proper incident thereto 
this authority would permit the company to engage in a variety of banking related businesses  including the ownership and operation of a savings association  or any entity engaged in consumer finance  equipment leasing  the operation of a computer service bureau including software development  and mortgage banking and brokerage 
the bhc act generally does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
additionally  bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the bhc act and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in  or own shares in companies engaged in  a wider range of nonbanking activities  including securities and insurance underwriting and sales  merchant banking and any other activity that the federal reserve  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the federal reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
as of the date of this filing  the company has not applied for approval to operate as a financial holding company 

table of contents federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring control of an fdic insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator 
control is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company  but may arise under certain circumstances between and ownership 
dividend payments 
our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the federal reserve applicable to bank holding companies 
as a delaware corporation  the company is subject to the limitations of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibit the company from paying dividends if the company is  or by payment of the dividend would become  insolvent  or if the payment of dividends would render the company unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business 
as a bank holding company  we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and our other subsidiaries 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue comes from dividends paid to us by the bank 
the federal reserve has the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends to its stockholders if it deems such dividend payments to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
with respect to this authority  and consistent with the source of strength policy for subsidiary banks  the federal reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for a bank holding company to pay dividends unless the company s net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the company s expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with its capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
both we and the bank are subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends  including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums 
the appropriate federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company  that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof 
the appropriate federal regulatory authorities have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
further  with respect to the company s participation in the cpp  the terms of our senior preferred stock sold to the ust provide that no dividends on any common or preferred stock that ranks equal to or junior to the senior preferred stock may be paid unless and until all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods on the senior preferred stock have been fully paid 
the bank has not paid cash dividends to us since  and no further dividends may be paid by the bank to us  or by us to our stockholders  without prior notice to our regulators 
the bank general 
the bank is an illinois state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system and accepts deposits which are insured by the fdic 
enforcement powers of our bank regulators  prompt corrective action 
a banking organization s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement 
federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
the extent of the regulators powers depends on whether the institution in question is adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  in each case as defined by regulation 
depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned  the regulators corrective powers include requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan  limiting the institution s asset growth and restricting its activities  requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock including additional voting stock or to be acquired  
table of contents restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates  restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits  ordering a new election of directors of the institution  requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed  prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks  requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries  prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt  and ultimately  appointing a receiver for the institution 
as of december  the bank was not subject to a directive from the federal reserve to increase its capital to an amount in excess of the minimum regulatory capital requirements  the bank exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements under federal reserve capital adequacy guidelines  and the bank was well capitalized  as defined by federal reserve regulations 
standards for safety and soundness 
the federal banking agencies have adopted the interagency guidelines for establishing standards for safety and soundness 
the guidelines establish certain safety and soundness standards for all depository institutions 
the operational and managerial standards in the guidelines relate to the following internal controls and information systems  internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  asset quality  and earnings 
rather than providing specific rules  the guidelines set forth basic compliance considerations and guidance with respect to a depository institution 
failure to meet the standards in the guidelines  however  could result in a request by the bank s regulators to provide a written compliance plan to demonstrate its efforts to come into compliance with such guidelines 
failure to provide a plan or to implement a provided plan requires the appropriate federal banking agency to issue an order to the institution requiring compliance 
until the deficiency cited in the regulator s order is cured  the regulator may restrict the institution s rate of growth  require the institution to increase its capital  restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances 
noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal banking regulators  including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments 

table of contents interstate branching 
pursuant to the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of riegle neal act  an adequately capitalized and managed bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state without regard to the permissibility of such acquisitions under state law  but remain subject to state requirements that a bank has been organized and operating for a period of time 
subject to certain other restrictions  the riegle neal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines to create interstate branches 
the riegle neal amendments act of and the regulatory relief act of provide further guidance on the application of host state laws to any branch located outside the host state 
the establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state rather than the acquisition of an out of state bank in its entirety has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion 
however  the dodd frank act permits well capitalized banks to establish branches across state lines without these impediments 
deposit insurance premiums 
the bank is a member of the dif and pays an insurance premium to the fund based upon its assessable deposits on a quarterly basis 
deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government 
the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of and require reporting by fdic insured institutions 
it is also authorized to terminate a depository bank s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the bank s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency 
the dodd frank act permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per insured depositor  retroactive to january  furthermore  the legislation provides that non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance coverage through december  this temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage replaces the transaction account guarantee program tag that expired on december  it covers all depository institution noninterest bearing transaction accounts  but not low interest bearing accounts 
unlike tag  there is no special assessment associated with the temporary unlimited insurance coverage  nor may institutions opt out of the unlimited coverage 
the dodd frank act also set a new minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
the fdic is required to attain this ratio by september  in addition  the dodd frank act had a significant impact on the calculation of deposit insurance assessment premiums 
beginning april   the dodd frank act required the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity 
the amount of the assessment rate is a function of the institution s risk category  of which there are four  and assessment base 
an institution s risk category is determined according to its supervisory rating and capital level 
the assessment rate for risk categories are calculated according to a formula  which relies on supervisory ratings and either certain financial ratios or long term debt ratings 
because the system is risk based  it allows banks to pay lower assessments to the fdic as their capital level and supervisory ratings improve 
similarly  if these indicators deteriorate  affected institutions will have to pay higher assessments to the fdic 
assessment rates range from basis points to basis points 
the fdic rule also provides the fdic s board with the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment if certain restrictions are met 
under the federal deposit insurance act fdia  the fdic board has the authority to set the annual assessment rate range for the various risk categories within certain regulatory limits and to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions when deemed necessary by the fdic s board 
the fdic imposed an emergency special assessment on june   which was collected on september  in addition  in september  the fdic extended the restoration plan period to eight years 
on november   the fdic adopted a final rule requiring prepayment of quarters of fdic premiums 
the fdic began to 
table of contents offset prepaid assessments on march   representing payment of the regular quarterly risk based deposit insurance assessment for the fourth quarter of any prepaid assessment not exhausted after collection of the amount due on june   will be returned to the institution 
fico assessments 
dif insured institutions pay a financing corporation fico assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued in the s in connection with the failures in the thrift industry 
these fico assessments are in addition to amounts assessed by the fdic for deposit insurance 
these assessments will continue until the bonds mature in supervisory assessments 
all illinois banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the idfpr to fund the agency s operations 
the amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of a bank s total assets 
during the year ended december   the bank paid supervisory assessments to the idfpr totaling  interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
in december  the federal banking agencies issued the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
this guidance  which updated guidance originally issued in  sets forth the minimum regulatory standards for appraisals 
it incorporates previous regulatory issuances affecting appraisals  addresses advances in information technology used in collateral evaluation  and clarifies standards for use of analytical methods and technological tools in developing evaluations 
this guidance also requires institutions to utilize strong internal controls to ensure reliable appraisals and evaluations and to monitor and periodically update valuations of collateral for existing real estate loans and transactions 
safe act registration requirements 
in connection with implementation of the secure and fair enforcement for mortgage licensing act of  the federal banking agencies announced final rules in july these rules implemented the provisions of the act requiring employees of agency related institutions to register with the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry  a database created by the states to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators 
residential mortgage loan originators must register prior to originating residential mortgage loans 
community reinvestment act requirements 
the bank is subject to periodic community reinvestment act cra review by our primary federal regulators 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions and does not limit the ability of such institutions to develop products and services believed best suited for a particular community 
note that an institution s cra assessment can be used by its regulators in their evaluation of certain applications  including a merger or the establishment of a branch office 
an unsatisfactory cra rating may form the basis for denial of such application 
the bank underwent a cra examination in january  for which it received an outstanding rating 
transactions with affiliates 
the bank must comply with sections a and b of the federal reserve act containing certain restrictions on its transactions with affiliates 
in general terms  these provisions require that transactions between a banking institution or its subsidiaries and such institution s affiliates be on terms as favorable to the institution as transactions with non affiliates 
in addition  these provisions contain certain restrictions on loans to affiliates  restricting such loans to a percentage of the institution s capital 
a covered affiliate  for purposes of these provisions  would include the company and any other company that is under our common control 
the dodd frank act significantly expanded the scope and coverage of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization and included specific changes to the law related to the definition of covered transaction in sections a and b  limitations on asset purchases from insiders and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements for covered transactions must be maintained 
with respect to the definition of covered transaction  the dodd frank act now defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank s loan or extension of credit to another person or company 
in addition  a derivative transaction with an affiliate is now deemed to be a covered transaction to 
table of contents the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate 
a separate provision of the dodd frank act states that an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from  or sell an asset to a bank insider or their related interests unless i the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties  and ii if the proposed transaction represents more than percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution  it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution s noninterested directors 
additionally  certain transactions with our directors  officers or controlling persons are also subject to conflicts of interest regulations 
among other things  these regulations require that loans to such persons and their related interests be made on terms substantially the same as for loans to unaffiliated individuals and must not create an abnormal risk of repayment or other unfavorable features for the financial institution

government monetary policies and economic controls 
our earnings and growth  as well as the earnings and growth of the banking industry  are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities  including the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recession and curb inflationary pressures 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits  and changes in the federal reserve discount rate 
these means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve authorities have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to have such an effect in the future 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in money markets  as well as the effect of credit policies by monetary and fiscal authorities  including the federal reserve  no prediction can be made as to possible future changes in interest rates  deposit levels  and loan demand  or their effect on our business and earnings or on the financial condition of our various customers 
changes to mortgage loan originator compensation 
effective april   previously existing regulations concerning the compensation of mortgage loan originators were amended 
as a result of these amendments  mortgage loan originators may not receive compensation based on a mortgage transaction s terms or conditions other than the amount of credit extended under the mortgage loan 
further  the new standards limit the total points and fees that a bank and or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to of the total loan amount 
mortgage loan originators may receive compensation from a consumer or from a lender  but not both 
these rules contain requirements designed to prohibit mortgage loan originators from steering consumers to loans that provide mortgage loan originators with greater compensation 
in addition  the rules contain other requirements concerning record keeping 
foreclosure and loan modifications 
federal and state laws further impact foreclosures and loan modifications  many of which laws have the effect of delaying or impeding the foreclosure process on real estate secured loans in default 
mortgages on commercial property can be modified  such as by reducing the principal amount of the loan or the interest rate  or by extending the term of the loan  through plans confirmed under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
in recent years  legislation has been introduced in the us congress that would amend the bankruptcy code to permit the modification of mortgages secured by residences  although at this time the enactment of such legislation is not presently proposed 
the scope  duration and terms of potential future legislation with similar effect continue to be discussed 
we cannot predict whether any such legislation will be passed or the impact  if any  it would have on our business 

table of contents legislative and regulatory initiatives from time to time  various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in the us congress and state legislatures  as well as by regulatory agencies 
such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system 
such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of the company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
if enacted  such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings associations  credit unions and other financial institutions 
the company cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted and  if enacted  the effect that it  or any implementing regulations  would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
a change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the company or the bank could have a material effect on the business of the company 
other regulatory authorities in addition to regulation  supervision and examination by federal banking agencies  we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to other federal and state laws and regulations  and to supervision and examination by other regulatory and self governing authorities  including the sec  the nasdaq global select market and others

item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks  including those described below  which in turn may affect the value of our securities 
in addition  other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  perhaps materially 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward looking statements 
before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities  you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
our business may be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
the company and the bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation  supervision and examination 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  fdic funds  customers and the banking system as a whole  rather than stockholders 
these regulations affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 

table of contents as a bank holding company  we are subject to regulation and supervision primarily by the federal reserve 
the bank  as an illinois chartered state member bank  is subject to regulation and supervision by both the idfpr and the federal reserve 
we and the bank undergo periodic examinations by these regulators  which have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies 
the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us are described in this report under the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business 
these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
for example  on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law  which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act  together with the regulations to be developed thereunder  includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike  including several provisions that will affect how community banks  thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future 
in addition  the federal reserve has adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks overdraft and mortgage lending practices 
further  the bureau of consumer financial protection was recently established  with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws  and additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in the near future 
such changes  including changes regarding interpretations and implementation  could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such changes could subject the company to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products the company may offer  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil monetary penalties  and or damage to the company s reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the company has policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
the policies of the federal reserve also have a significant impact on us 
among other things  the federal reserve s monetary policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest bearing deposits  and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition from financial institutions and other financial services providers may adversely affect our growth and profitability 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and experience intense competition from other financial institutions in our market 
we compete with these institutions in making loans  attracting deposits and recruiting and retaining talented people 
we also compete with nonbank financial service providers  including mortgage companies  finance companies  mutual funds and credit unions 
many of these competitors are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a result 
we have observed that the competition in our market for making commercial loans has resulted in more competitive pricing and credit structure  as well as intense competition for qualified commercial lending officers 
we also may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size  limited branch network  narrower product offerings and lack of geographic diversification as compared to some of our larger competitors 
although our competitive strategy is to provide a distinctly superior customer and employee experience  we can give no assurance that this strategy will be successful 
our growth and profitability depend on our continued ability to compete effectively within our market area 

table of contents our business is subject to the conditions of the local economy in which we operate and continued weakness in the local economy and the real estate markets may adversely affect us 
our success is dependent to a large extent upon the general economic conditions in the chicago area  where most of our banking and financial services are provided 
accordingly  the local economic conditions in chicago have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
our operating results have been negatively impacted by the historically high level of nonperforming loans in our commercial loan portfolio 
continued weakness in the chicago area economy has had and may continue to have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including higher provisions for loan losses and net loan charge offs  lower net interest income caused by an increase in nonaccrual loans  and higher legal and collection costs 
in addition  we may be required to continue to devote substantial additional attention and resources to nonperforming asset management rather than focusing on business growth activities 
continued adverse conditions in the local economy could also reduce demand for new loans and other financial services and impair our ability to attract and retain deposits 
our business is subject to domestic and  to a lesser extent  international economic conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control and could adversely affect our business 
from december through june  the united states economy was in recession 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions in the united states was greatly reduced 
although general economic conditions have improved  certain sectors  such as real estate and manufacturing  remain weak  and unemployment remains at historically high levels  including within the chicago area  where most of our customers are located 
in addition  local governments and many businesses continue to experience serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and decreased liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions also led to the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which  in turn  has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  as well as demand for loans and other products and services the company offers  is highly dependent upon on the business environment in the markets where the company operates  in the state of illinois generally and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
on august   standard poor s lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america from aaa to aa 
a further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and worldwide 
any such adverse impact could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial condition and results of operations 
many of our investment securities are issued by us government sponsored entities 
further  concerns about the european union s sovereign debt crisis have also caused uncertainty for financial markets globally 
such risks could indirectly affect the company by affecting its hedging or other counterparties  as well as the company s customers with european businesses or assets denominated in the euro or companies in the company s market with european businesses or affiliates 

table of contents overall  during  the business environment was unfavorable for many households and businesses in the united states 
while economic conditions in the chicago area  the state of illinois and the united states have generally improved since the recession  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue or occur at a meaningful rate 
such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans  business  results of operations and financial condition 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments  which are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and which may differ from actual results 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and general reporting practices within the financial services industry  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
some accounting policies  such as those pertaining to our allowance for loan loss and deferred tax asset and the necessity of any related valuation allowance  require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in subsequent periods 
our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
making loans is a substantial part of our business  and every loan we make is subject to the risk that it will not be repaid or that any underlying collateral in the case of secured loans will not be sufficient to assure full repayment 
among other things  the risk of non payment is affected by changes in economic  market and industry conditions  the credit risks associated with the particular borrower and type of loan  cash flow of the borrower and or the project being financed  the duration of the loan  and opportunities to identify potential loan repayment issues when remedial action may be most effective 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is established through an accounting reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  which we believe is adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which are subject to material changes 
continuing deterioration in or stagnation of economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans and any underlying collateral  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of our control  may require an increase in our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  our federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and  based on judgments that differ from those of our management  may require an increase in our provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs 
further  if loan charge offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance 
any increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned allowance for loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to the process for determining the appropriate level of our allowance for loan losses 

table of contents our mortgage loan repurchase reserve for losses could be insufficient 
we currently maintain a repurchase reserve  which is a liability on the balance sheets  to reflect best estimate of expected losses that have incurred on loans that we have sold or securitized into the secondary market and must subsequently repurchase or with respect to which we must indemnify the purchasers and insurers because of violations of customary representations and warranties 
increases to this reserve for current loan sales reduce mortgage banking revenue 
the level of the reserve reflects management s continuing evaluation of loss experience on repurchased loans  indemnifications  and present economic conditions  as well as the actions of loan purchasers and guarantors 
the determination of the appropriate level of the secondary market reserve inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of repurchase risks and expected losses subsequently experienced 
both the assumptions and estimates used could be inaccurate  resulting in a level of reserve that is less than actual losses 
if additional reserves are required  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to interest rate risk  including interest rate fluctuations that could reduce our profitability 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the open market committee of the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of the company s securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore  earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  if these strategies prove ineffective  or if any substantial  unexpected and prolonged change in market interest rates occurs  such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain hedging strategies that we use to manage investment in mortgage servicing rights msrs may be ineffective to offset any adverse changes in the fair value of these assets due to changes in interest rates and market liquidity 
we invest in msrs to support mortgage banking strategies and diversify revenue streams from our mortgage banking segment 
the value of these assets and the income they provide tend to be counter cyclical to the changes in production volumes and gain on sale of loans 
we also enter into derivatives to hedge msrs to offset changes in fair value resulting from the actual or anticipated changes in prepayments and changing interest rate environments 
the primary risk associated with msrs is that in a declining interest rate environment  they will likely lose a substantial portion of their value as a result of higher than anticipated prepayments 
conversely  
table of contents these assets generally increase in value in a rising interest rate environment to the extent that prepayments are slower than previously estimated 
our hedging strategies are highly susceptible to prepayment risk  basis risk  market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve  among other factors 
in addition  hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding assets and general market factors 
if these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds  it may incur losses that would adversely impact earnings 
our residential mortgage lending profitability could be significantly reduced if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans 
mortgage production  especially refinancings  decline in rising interest rate environments 
while we have been experiencing historically low interest rates  the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely 
when interest rates increase  there can be no assurance that our mortgage production will continue at current levels 
because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate  the profitability of our mortgage banking operations depends in large part upon our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain 
thus  in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment  we are dependent upon i the existence of an active secondary market and ii our ability to profitably sell loans into that market 
our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single family mortgage loans  which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by the gses and other institutional and non institutional investors 
these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans 
because the largest participants in the secondary market are government sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law  any future changes in laws that significantly affect them could  in turn  adversely affect our operations 
the impact on us of existing proposals to reform fannie mae and freddie mac  which were place into conservatorship in  is difficult to predict 
in addition  our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by gses and other market participants 
our ability to remain eligible to originate and securitize government insured loans may also depend on having an acceptable peer relative delinquency ratio for federal housing administration the fha loans 
any significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the gses could materially and adversely affect our operations 
further  the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time to time by the sponsoring entity which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations or other administrative costs 
we have counterparty risk and therefore we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and the soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are generally interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  credit or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and regularly engage in transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks and other institutional customers 
many of these transactions may expose us to credit or other risks if another financial institution experiences adverse circumstances 
in certain circumstances  the collateral that we hold may be insufficient to fully cover the risk that a counterparty defaults on its obligations  which may cause us to experience losses that could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to certain operational risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees of financial services firms in recent years 
misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us  improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information 
employee fraud  errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation 
it is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct  and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases 
employee errors could also subject us to civil claims for negligence 
we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures designed to reduce the risk of loss from employee or customer fraud or misconduct  employee errors and operational risks  including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of company records and data 
the company relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various company transactions 
in some cases  the company has contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on behalf of the company 
these systems include  but are not limited to  general ledger  payroll  employee benefits  loan and deposit processing  mortgage origination  secondary marketing  msrs  servicing of mortgage loans and securities portfolio management 
while the company performs a review of controls instituted by the applicable vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and performs its own testing of user controls  the company must rely on the continued maintenance of controls by these third party vendors  including safeguards over the security of customer data 
in addition  the company maintains  or contracts with third parties to maintain  backups of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems 
nonetheless  the company may incur a temporary disruption in its ability to conduct its business or process its transactions  or incur damage to its reputation if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems 
such disruption or a breach of security may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
system failure or breaches of our network security  including with respect to our internet banking activities  could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use in our operations and internet banking activities could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from physical theft  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event  as well as from security breaches  denial of service attacks  viruses  worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers 
computer break ins  phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  as well as that of our customers engaging in internet banking activities 
in addition  advances in computer capabilities or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of our systems designed to protect customer data 
although we have procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to mitigate the risk of such occurrences  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
any interruption in  or breach in security of  our computer systems and network infrastructure  or that of our internet 
table of contents banking customers  could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to lending concentration risks 
we have focused on repositioning our portfolio to reduce our exposure to industries and sectors that we no longer consider economically desirable 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans of which approximately are commercial real estate loans 
our commercial loans are typically larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have the potential for higher losses on an individual loan basis 
credit quality issues on larger commercial loans  if they were to occur  could cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans  and the amount of charge offs and recoveries between periods 
the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans  which would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
the problems that have occurred in the residential real estate and mortgage markets throughout much of the united states also affected the commercial real estate market 
in our market areas  we have generally experienced a downturn in credit performance by our commercial real estate loan customers  and in light of the uncertainty that exists in the economy and credit markets  there can be no guarantee that we will not experience further deterioration in the performance of commercial real estate and other real estate loans in the future 
in such case  we may not be able to realize the amount of security that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan  which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition or capital 
we may not be able to access sufficient and cost effective sources of liquidity 
liquidity is essential to our business and drives our ability to make new loans or invest in securities 
in addition  the company requires liquidity to meet its deposit and debt obligations as they come due 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy generally 
factors that could reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the chicago area market  difficult credit markets or adverse regulatory actions against us 
as part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to what is provided by in market deposits and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
although we have increased our funding from our core customers to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding  we continue to use brokered money market accounts and certificates of deposits  out of local market certificates of deposit  broker dealer repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank frb advances as a source of liquidity 
under fdic regulations  only well capitalized institutions may issue brokered certificates of deposit cds without prior regulatory approval 
the bank is currently categorized as well capitalized and  therefore  may continue to utilize this funding source 
brokered cd distributors may use other criteria in determining which banks to allow to issue brokered cds through their distribution network 
if our access to the brokered cd market were reduced in any material respect  it could lead to an inability to replace brokered deposits at maturity  which would result in higher costs to  or reduced asset levels at  the bank 

table of contents our liquidity position is affected by the amount of cash and other liquid assets on hand  payment of interest and dividends on our outstanding debt and equity instruments  capital we inject into the bank  redemption of our previously issued debt  proceeds we raise through the issuance of debt and equity instruments  and dividends received from the bank if permitted 
our future liquidity position may be materially adversely affected if  in the future  one or a combination of the following events occur the bank reports net losses or its earnings are weak relative to our cash flow needs as a holding company  we deem it advisable or are required by our regulators to use cash at the holding company level to support loan growth of the bank or address other capital needs of the bank through downstream capital injections  or we have difficulty raising cash at the holding company level through the issuance of debt or equity securities or accessing additional sources of credit 
given the losses recorded by the bank from through and the resulting limitations imposed by our regulators on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us  we have been dependent upon our current cash position and cash proceeds generated by capital raises to meet liquidity needs at the holding company level 
if we foresee that we face diminished liquidity  we may  to the extent possible  seek to manage this risk by reducing the amount of capital we inject into the bank 
this may further reduce the capital position of the bank  cause our growth to slow and result in regulatory criticism 
we are subject to liquidity risk  including unanticipated deposit volatility 
our usual liquidity management challenges include responding to potential volatility in our customers deposit balances 
we primarily use advances from the fhlb  broker dealer repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased to meet our immediate liquidity needs 
since  we have experienced a significant increase in client deposits  which has allowed us to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding sources 
however  there can be no assurance that this recent level of client deposit growth will continue  that client deposits will remain at current levels or that we will be able to maintain the recent reduced reliance on wholesale deposits 
increased customer confidence in general economic conditions  higher expected rates of return on other investments including a rise in interest rates or additional restrictions on the availability of fdic coverage could each cause our customers to move all or a portion of their deposits to other investment options  thus causing a reduction in our deposits and increasing our reliance on wholesale or other funding sources 
in addition  we have customers that maintain significant deposit balances with us  the immediate withdrawal of which could have a material adverse affect on our daily liquidity management 
further  the number of branches we maintain is small relative to our asset size  which could negatively impact our ability to acquire new deposits 
in the event that we experience a significant deposit outflow  our liquidity could be negatively impacted such that our capital position  reputation or profitability could also be adversely affected 
if we fail to effectively manage the risk of deposit volatility  our business  financial condition  results of operations and reputation could be materially adversely affected 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on business demand deposits could increase the company s interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on these demand deposits to compete for customers 
if competitive pressures require the company to pay interest on these demand deposits to attract and retain business customers  its interest expense would increase and its net interest margin would decrease 
this could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  the effect of the repeal of the prohibition could be more significant in a higher interest rate environment as business customers would have a greater incentive to seek interest on demand deposits 

table of contents changes in our credit ratings could increase our financing costs or make it more difficult for us to obtain funding or capital on commercially acceptable terms 
we are rated by several different rating agencies  including idc and bankrate 
com 
many factors  both within and out of our control  may cause these agencies to downgrade their ratings related to the company  which could subject us to negative publicity  adversely impact our ability to acquire or retain deposits and increase our cost of borrowing or limit our asset growth 
also  our credit ratings are an important factor to the institutions that provide our sources of liquidity  and reductions in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity  increase our borrowing costs  limit our access to the capital markets or trigger unfavorable contractual obligations 
we cannot give any assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
the company is a bank holding company and its sources of funds are limited 
the company is a bank holding company  and its operations are primarily conducted by the bank  which is subject to significant federal and state regulation  as discussed above and elsewhere in this report 
when available  cash to pay dividends to stockholders of the company is derived primarily from dividends received from the bank 
the company s ability to receive dividends or loans from the bank is restricted 
dividend payments by the bank to the company in the future will require generation of future earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval if any proposed dividends are in excess of prescribed guidelines 
further  as a structural matter  the company s right to participate in the assets of the bank in the event of a liquidation or reorganization of the bank would be subject to the claims of the bank s creditors  including depositors  which would take priority except to the extent the company may be a creditor with a recognized claim 
as of december   the bank had deposits and other liabilities of approximately billion 
our business strategy is dependent on our continued ability to attract  develop and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel in senior management and customer relationship positions 
we believe our future success is dependent  in part  on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced personnel in key senior management and other positions 
our competitive strategy is to provide each of our commercial customers with a highly qualified relationship manager that will serve as the customer s key point of contact with us 
achieving the status of a trusted advisor for our customers also requires that we minimize relationship manager turnover and provide stability to the customer relationship 
competition for experienced personnel in our industry is intense  and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain such personnel 
our recent operating results have reduced our cash based incentive awards to senior management and other key employees 
in addition  our participation in the troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program cpp places limits on executive compensation  which may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain certain key employees  especially if we are competing for talent against institutions that are not subject to such restrictions 
any inability to retain and attract key personnel could negatively impact our operations 
our reputation could be damaged by negative publicity 
reputational risk  or the risk to our business  financial condition or results of operations from negative publicity  is inherent in our business 
negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas  including legal and regulatory compliance  lending practices  corporate governance  litigation  inadequate protection of customer data  ethical behavior of our employees  and from actions taken by regulators  ratings agencies and others as a result of that conduct 
damage to our reputation could impact our ability to attract new or maintain existing loan and deposit customers  employees and business relationships 

table of contents new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to certain additional risks 
from time to time  we will consider and may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
these activities can involve a number of uncertainties  risks and expenses  including the investment of significant time and resources  and we can give no assurance that our projected price and profitability targets will be attainable or that our efforts will be successful 
these initiatives have required and will continue to require us to enter geographical markets that are new to us 
in addition  new lines of business and new products and services could significantly impact the effectiveness of our system of internal controls  and present requirements for legal compliance with which we were previously unfamiliar 
failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may experience difficulties in managing our future growth 
our future success in part  depends on our achieving growth in commercial banking relationships that result in increased commercial loans outstanding at yields that are profitable to us 
achieving our growth targets requires us to attract customers who currently bank at other financial institutions in our market  thereby increasing our share of the market 
our commercial banking strategy is to provide a local  high touch relationship servicing experience that we believe is attractive to customers in our marketplace 
in addition  we actively pursue high quality relationship managers to extend our reach in the market place 
our success will also depend in part on continued growth in our mortgage banking business 
our mortgage growth goals will necessitate further expansion of our national mortgage platform and  to a lesser degree  additional diversification of revenue streams from this business 
although we believe that we have the necessary resources in place to successfully manage our future growth  our growth strategy exposes us to certain risks and expenses  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our market presence or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations 
our strategy for future growth also may place a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
maintaining credit quality while growing our loan portfolio is critical to achieving and sustaining profitable growth 
we may not be able to manage our growth effectively 
if we fail to do so  our business would be materially harmed 
in furtherance of our growth strategy  we may also seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future  and we may engage in banking center expansion 
in connection with future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current stockholders 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our regulators will permit us to implement an acquisition strategy 
furthermore  there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve a level of profitability that will justify the investment that we made in any such acquisition 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state tax laws and changes in interpretation of existing laws 
the company s financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws 
given the current economic and political environment  and ongoing federal and state budgetary pressures  the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation may occur 
for example  in january  the state of illinois passed an income tax increase for both individuals and corporations  which increased our state income tax rate 
the further enactment of such legislation  or changes in the interpretation of existing law  including provisions impacting tax rates  apportionment  consolidation or combination  income  expenses  and credits  may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our participation in the tarp cpp may place significant restrictions on our operations 
under the tarp cpp  our ability to declare or pay dividends on any of our shares of common stock is limited 
specifically  we are not permitted to pay dividends on our common stock without the ust s approval until november   unless all of the outstanding shares of our series b preferred have been redeemed or 
table of contents transferred by the ust to unaffiliated third parties 
in addition  our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock and other securities is restricted 
the consent of the ust generally is required for us to make any stock repurchases other than in connection with the administration of any employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice until november   unless all of the outstanding shares of our series b preferred have been redeemed or transferred by the ust to unaffiliated third parties 
further  we may not repurchase shares of our common stock or shares of our nonvoting convertible preferred stock  series d series d preferred  and nonvoting convertible preferred stock  series g series g preferred  if we are in arrears on the payment of series b preferred dividends 
due to our participation in the tarp cpp  we are also subject to the ust s current standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the ust holds our series b preferred  as set forth in the interim final rule on tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance on june  the compensation standards apply to certain of our senior executive officers and certain other of our most highly compensated employees and  among other things  place specific restrictions on the types and amounts of compensation that we may pay to these individuals 
certain of these restrictions may force us to issue additional shares of our common stock  rather than cash or other non equity awards  to compensate and retain our executive officers 
any such common stock issuances likely would result in dilution to our common stockholders  which would have an adverse impact on the market value of our common stock 
regulatory requirements  growth plans or operating results may require us to raise additional capital  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
at december   both we and the bank were categorized as well capitalized under the applicable regulatory capital framework 
to the extent regulatory requirements change  our future operating results erode capital or we seek to expand through loan growth or acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional capital 
our ability to raise capital in any such event would depend on conditions in the capital markets  which are outside of our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot be assured of our ability to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms 
the inability to attract new capital investment  or to attract capital on terms acceptable to us  could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or our ability to maintain or expand our operations 
we have not paid a dividend on our common stock since the second quarter of in addition  regulatory restrictions and liquidity constraints at the holding company level could impair our ability to make distributions on our outstanding securities 
historically  our primary source of funds at the holding company level has been dividends received from the bank 
in order to preserve capital  our board of directors suspended the payment of dividends on our common stock beginning in the second quarter of current and future liquidity constraints at the holding company level could continue to impair our ability to declare and pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or pay interest on our outstanding debt securities in the future 
we also have agreed  consistent with our past practice  to continue to provide the federal reserve and the idfpr with notice before we declare dividends on our common or preferred stock or pay interest on our debt securities 
the ust may also impose additional limitations on our ability to use funds we received from our participation in the tarp cpp  including the payment of dividends or interest on our outstanding securities 
for example  we are currently prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock without the ust s consent until the earlier of november  or the date on which the ust no longer holds any shares of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b series b preferred 
if we are unable to pay dividends or interest on our outstanding securities in the future  the market value of such securities may be materially adversely affected

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago  and we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of products and services primarily to closely held commercial businesses and their owner operators in the chicago area 
we also provide asset based lending and residential mortgage banking services through offices both in chicago and in other geographic markets 
at december   we had assets of billion  deposits of billion and stockholders equity of million 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and december  and the results of operations for the years ended december   december   and december  this discussion should be read together with the selected financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform  in all material respects  to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting and reporting policies from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience  current information and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments  and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than actual results 
we consider our policies for the allowance for loan losses  the realizability of deferred tax assets  derivatives and the valuation of investment securities to be critical accounting policies 
the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that we consider sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including historical charge off experience  changes in the size of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent  criticized and impaired loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  
table of contents work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss on loans to those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only our borrowers probability of default  but also the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the current illiquidity in the chicago area real estate market has increased the uncertainty with respect to real estate values 
because of the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding periods until sale and the collateral liquidation method  our actual losses may materially vary from our current estimates 
our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have the potential for higher losses for each loan 
these larger loans can cause greater volatility in our reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate for any one loan may have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans can cause an increase in uncollectible loans and our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  our allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
income taxes we maintain net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences between book and taxable income  the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses 
for income tax return purposes  only net charge offs of loans are deductible  not the provision for loan losses 
under gaap  a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future taxable income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence  if any  of taxes paid in available carry back years and the likelihood that taxable income will be generated in future periods  positive credit quality trends and the state of overall economic environment 
examples of negative evidence may include a cumulative loss in the current year and prior two years  no tax planning opportunities to accelerate income  availability of taxes paid in open carryback years and negative general business and economic trends 
we currently do not maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because management has determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange and corridor agreements  callable interest rate exchange agreements  as well as interest rate lock and forward loan sale commitments  to either accommodate individual customer needs or to assist in our interest rate risk management 
all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of oci and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change in fair value 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as an accounting hedge are also reported currently in earnings 

table of contents at the inception of a formally designated hedge and quarterly thereafter  an assessment is made to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that derivatives are not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivatives are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations in other noninterest income  which could result in greater volatility in our earnings 
the estimates of fair values of certain of our derivative instruments  such as interest rate exchange agreements or swaps and corridors  are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate market based valuations 
the valuations are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flow of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
in addition  the fair value estimate also incorporates a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the risk of nonperformance by both us and our counterparties in the fair value measurement 
the resulting fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and  therefore  can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the derivative contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in volatility in our earnings 
valuation of investment securities the fair value of our investment securities portfolio is determined in accordance with gaap  which requires that we classify financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy 
the determination of fair value is highly subjective and requires management to rely on estimates  assumptions  and judgments that can affect amounts reported in our financial statements 
we obtain the fair value of investment securities from an independent pricing service 
we periodically review the pricing methodology for each significant class of assets used by this third party pricing service to assess the compliance with accounting standards for fair value measurement and classification in the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes  market spreads  cash flows  the us treasury yield curve  live trading levels  trade execution data  market consensus prepayment speeds  credit information  including credit spreads and current rating from credit rating agencies  and the bond s terms and conditions  among other things 
while we use an independent pricing service to obtain the fair values of our investment portfolio  we employ certain control procedures to determine the reasonableness of the valuations 
we validate the overall reasonableness of the fair values by comparing information obtained from our independent pricing service to other third party valuation sources for selected assets and review the valuations and any significant differences in valuations with members of management who have the relevant technical expertise to assess the results 
in addition  the company reviews the third party valuation methodology on a regular basis 
each quarter we review our investment securities portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary or other than temporary  based on an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  as well as the underlying collateral  if applicable 
our analysis includes an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings and a cash flow analysis  considering default rates  loss severities based upon the location of the collateral  and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we use other independent pricing sources to obtain fair value estimates and perform discounted cash flow analysis for selected securities 
when the discounted cash flow analysis obtained from those independent pricing sources indicates that we expect all future principal and interest payments will be received in accordance with their original contractual terms  we do not intend to sell the security  and we more likely than not will not be required to sell 
table of contents the security before recovery  the unrealized loss is deemed temporary 
if such analysis shows that we do not expect to be able to recover our entire investment  an other than temporary impairment charge will be recorded in current earnings for the amount of the credit loss component 
the amount of impairment related to factors other than the credit loss is recognized in oci 
our assessments of creditworthiness and the resultant expected cash flows are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only the specific security and its underlying collateral but also the severity of the current overall economic downturn 
our cash flow estimates for mortgage related securities are based on estimates of mortgage default rates  severity of loss  and prepayments  which are difficult to predict 
changes in assumptions can result in material changes in expected cash flows 
therefore  unrealized losses that we have determined to be temporary may at a later date be determined to be other than temporary and have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
outlook since  we have pursued a two pronged strategy of asset quality remediation and earnings growth and diversification  which we call our fix and grow strategy 
the fix component refers to our continuing efforts to improve asset quality issues largely caused by the downturn in the chicago area economy  and the resulting impact on real estate prices and liquidity 
the grow component of our strategy seeks to increase and diversify our pre tax  pre provision earnings by repositioning our commercial banking business to provide middle market lending across a wide array of industries 
in addition  grow also encompasses cole taylor business capital  our asset based lending arm established in  and cole taylor mortgage  our mortgage banking business established in we plan to continue pursuing our fix and grow strategy in regarding the fix component of our strategy  we expect to continue to remediate asset quality and to reduce lending concentrations in areas of higher risk 
improvement in asset quality will in part depend on a sustained improvement in the economy and in particular the chicago area real estate market 
we also expect to maintain focus on the growth component of our strategy emphasizing our commercial banking and mortgage origination and servicing businesses 
cole taylor business capital and cole taylor mortgage are relatively new businesses and we believe that each have meaningful potential for continued growth 
we will also look for additional opportunities for strategic  measured expansion provided it increases stockholder value  especially in the areas of deposit franchise enhancement 
results of operations we reported net income applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share outstanding for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the higher net income applicable to common stockholders in was due to the combination of improved credit quality and strong business line growth and the reversal of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset of million

our results  in combination with management s belief that we have achieved sustainable profitability  supported the reversal of the previously established million valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset 
this reversal  in combination with our strong business line growth  resulted in net income applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  highlights pre tax  pre provision earnings from operations were million in  up from million for the full year revenue was million in  up from million in net interest income increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  nonperforming loans were million and of total loans at december   compared to million and of total loans at december  the allowance for loan losses was million and of nonperforming loans at december   compared to million and at december  at december   commercial criticized and classified loans totaled million down from million at december  in may  we completed a million private offering which consisted of million of series c preferred and million in principal amount of subordinated notes

our accounting and reporting policies conform to gaap and general practice within the banking industry 
management uses certain non gaap financial measures to evaluate the company s financial performance such 
table of contents as the non gaap measures of pre tax  pre provision operating earnings and of revenue 
management believes that these measures are useful because they provide a more comparable basis for evaluating financial performance from operations period to period

the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or incurred on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in net interest margin of in was down slightly from in  as decreases in the yield on all interest earning assets were largely offset by continued decreases in our funding costs 
the lower funding costs were a result of deposit repricing and deliberate changes made to the funding mix 

table of contents the interest earning asset yield declined to in from in due to decreased yields on both loans and investment securities 
the yield earned on loans decreased to during from in the yield on our investment securities portfolio also declined to in from in the yield on total interest bearing liabilities dropped from in to in significant  anticipated deposit repricing occurred in  largely in customer certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit 
the decline in yield was also due in part to funding related transactions  including the termination of certain derivative contracts and early extinguishments of debt in we determined that these actions were in our best long term economic interest  despite the recognition of short term losses and expenses 
our average interest earning assets during were billion  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the billion of average interest earning assets during the decrease was driven by lower loan balances  primarily in the commercial real estate secured portfolio  excluding commercial owner occupied real estate loans  due to pay downs and nonperforming loan resolutions during offsetting this decline was an increase in consumer loans  largely due to certain mortgages originated by cole taylor mortgage being held in the loan portfolio rather than being sold in the secondary market 
our average interest bearing liabilities decreased from billion in to billion in  a decrease of million or 
other borrowings decreased million  or  from million in to million in offsetting this was an increase in notes payable and other advances  which increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
these actions were taken to shift the funding mix to lower the overall cost of funds 
average interest bearing deposit balances of billion in were slightly lower than balances of billion during total deposits increased due to growth in average noninterest bearing deposit balances  which increased million  or to million during  as compared to million in with an adjustment for tax exempt income  our consolidated net interest income for was million  compared to million for this non gaap presentation is discussed below 
see tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in  that was largely driven by a basis point increase in net interest margin 
net interest margin increased to in  compared to in  as our funding costs continued to decrease by more than the yield on our interest earning assets 
funding costs were lowered as the low interest rate environment enabled our portfolio of term deposits to continue to reprice to current market rates 
increased noninterest bearing deposits from customers and the ability to take advantage of short term funding opportunities also reduced funding costs 
the interest earning asset yield declined to in from in the yield earned on loans increased slightly to during from in however  this was more than offset by a drop in the yield on our investment securities portfolio  which decreased to in from in our average interest earning assets during were billion  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the billion of average interest earning assets during the decrease was driven by lower loan balances largely offset by higher investment portfolio balances 
average loan balances fell due to the continued downward pressure from the economic environment

see tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins 
tax equivalent adjustments to yields and margins as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  we adjusted the interest earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments

provision for loan losses we determine a provision for loan losses that we consider sufficient to maintain an allowance to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
for additional information concerning this determination  see application of critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses  nonperforming assets  impaired loans and allowance for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses totaled million during  a decrease of million  or  as compared to the million provision for loan losses recorded in as commercial criticized and classified loans continued to decline and asset quality improved 
nonperforming loans and commercial criticized and classified loans decreased in as a result of significant nonperforming asset resolutions  combined with a slowdown in both migrations to nonperforming status and inflows to criticized and classified status 
nonperforming loans totaled million at december   compared to million at december   a decrease of million  or 
the total allowance for loan losses decreased from million at december  to million at december  and the allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans improved from at december  to at december  see nonperforming assets and allowance for loan losses for further discussion of the credit quality of our loan portfolio and our allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses of million during was million higher than the million provision for loan losses during the provision in reflected the continued weakness in the chicago area real estate market  deterioration in our bank and bank holding company loans  the rise in nonperforming and impaired loans  and the increase in the severity of the estimated losses associated with these loans 

table of contents noninterest income the following table presents the composition of our noninterest income for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands service charges mortgage banking revenue gain loss on disposition of bulk purchased mortgage loans gain on sales of investment securities other derivative income letter of credit and other loan fees change in market value of employee deferred compensation plan other noninterest income total noninterest income year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest income during totaled million  down from million during  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was driven by a higher level of gains on sales of investment securities in  partially offset by increased mortgage banking revenue and increased other derivative income in we derive service charges principally from deposit accounts 
service charge income is affected by a number of factors  such as the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
service charges increased slightly from million in to million in due to increases in commercial account service charges and foreign exchange service charges 
mortgage banking revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase is due to a rise in loan fundings at cole taylor mortgage related to sustained low mortgage interest rates and continued expansion of the national platform 
also contributing to the increase was growth in mortgage servicing activities  including retained servicing and purchased mortgage servicing rights 
in  we sold mortgage backed securities from our available for sale investment securities portfolio to minimize prepayment risk 
we recorded net gains on the sales of available for sale investment securities of million in this compares to gains of million in see investment securities below for a further discussion 
other derivative income was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to higher volumes on interest rate swap agreements entered into by commercial clients of our banking segment 
see derivative financial instruments following for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
letter of credit and other loan fees decreased from million in to million in due to a decline in the volume and amount of fees charged per customer in our asset based lending operation in 
table of contents year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest income during totaled million  up from million during  an increase of million or 
increases in the gains on the sales of investment securities in of million  mortgage banking revenue of million from cole taylor mortgage and letters of credit fees of million drove the increase 
in  we recorded gains on the sales of available for sale investment securities of million from the sale of approximately million of investment securities  mostly mortgage related securities 
we realized gains when we sold mortgage backed securities that had been experiencing higher than anticipated prepayments and to take advantage of the low level of interest rates and tightening spreads in the market later in the year 
see investment securities below for a further discussion 
other derivative income totaled million in  compared to million in the increase was almost entirely due to an increase in the number and the size of fees collected on customer related swaps 
see derivative financial instruments following for further discussion of our derivative instruments 
standby letters of credit and other loan fees totaled million in  compared to million in the increase in fees during was primarily due to our expanded asset based lending operations

year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest expense was million during  a decrease of million  or  as compared to noninterest expense of million during the decrease was driven by lower nonperforming asset expense in  partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits and early extinguishment of debt expense 

table of contents total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expense in was largely due to an increase in base salaries and sales incentives at cole taylor mortgage  a large portion of which is the full year impact in of adding new employees in  as that business segment s loan fundings increased and it expanded its national presence 
the total number of employees at the company was at december   compared to at december  nonperforming asset expense decreased million or from to nonperforming asset expense was million during as compared to million during the decrease was driven by lower write downs expenses on other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets and a reversal of unfunded commitment reserves that were resolved during nonperforming asset expense reported in noninterest expense includes expenses associated with impaired loans  oreo and other repossessed assets held for sale as well as expenses related to impaired and nonperforming loans held for investment 
for assets held for sale  nonperforming asset expense related to oreo and other repossessed assets includes costs associated with owning and managing these assets  including real estate taxes  insurance  utilities and property management costs as well as any subsequent write downs required by changes in the fair value of the assets and any gains or losses on dispositions 
in addition  nonperforming asset expense included losses on impaired and nonaccrual commercial loans classified as held for sale due to additional write downs related to declines in the fair value subsequent to when such assets were classified as held for sale 
nonperforming asset expense related to loans held for investment includes expenses incurred by the company s loan workout function for collection and foreclosure costs  receiver fees and expenses  and any other expenses incurred to protect the company s interests in any loan collateral 
in addition  nonperforming asset expense includes changes in the liability that the company established for estimated probable losses from off balance sheet commitments associated with impaired loans  such as standby letters of credit or unfunded loan commitments 
a quantification of the amount of expense in each of these categories for the periods indicated is as follows for the year ended december  in thousands held for sale held for investment total our fdic insurance premium decreased from to by million primarily due to a change in the methodology used in calculating the fdic insurance premium  in conformance with fdic requirements 
the premium calculation now includes a component based on assets  rather than basing the calculation entirely on deposits 
in  three structured repurchase agreements were terminated and we incurred million in early extinguishment of debt expense related to these terminations 
other noninterest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is largely due to a volume driven increase in loan related expenses 

table of contents our efficiency ratio was in  compared to in the improvement in the efficiency ratio is the result of higher noninterest income in primarily due to increased mortgage banking revenue and other derivative income  combined with a decrease in noninterest expense due to lower nonperforming asset expense in year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total noninterest expense was million during  an increase of million  or  as compared to noninterest expense of million during the increase in expense was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits expense of million and nonperforming asset expense of million 
these increases were partly offset by lower fdic assessments of million 
total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expense in was largely due to the higher base salaries and sales incentives at cole taylor mortgage as that business added new employees during the total number of employees at the company was at december   compared to at december  nonperforming asset expense reported in noninterest expense includes expenses associated with impaired loans  oreo and other repossessed assets held for sale as well as expenses related to impaired and nonperforming loans held for investment 
nonperforming asset expense increased to million during as compared to million during the increase was primarily associated with additional write downs on oreo during the amount of nonperforming asset expense is impacted by the complexity and number of nonperforming loans and oreo and could continue to be significant in future periods 
a quantification of the amount of expense in each of these categories for the periods indicated is as follows for the year ended december  in thousands held for sale held for investment total our fdic insurance premium decreased in from  primarily due to the nonrecurring fdic special assessment in the second quarter of of million 
other noninterest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  other noninterest expense includes costs for advertising and public relations  business meals and travel  board of directors fees  operational losses and other operating expenses such as telephone  postage  office supplies and printing 
our efficiency ratio was in  compared to in the impact of higher nonperforming asset expense was mostly offset by higher net interest and noninterest income 
income taxes in  we established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset because we concluded that  based upon the weight of all available evidence  it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would not be realized 
the valuation allowance increased million during to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in the required valuation allowance was largely due to the increase in our net deferred tax asset primarily due to changes in our allowance for loan losses and 
table of contents federal net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance solely attributable to identifiable events recorded in oci  primarily changes in unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities  the tax effects of which were allocated to oci 
we evaluate the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
for the year ended december   management determined that is it more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
this conclusion was based on an analysis of both positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence included our return to profitability  significant improvement in asset quality and credit ratios  the continued reduction in our liquidating real estate construction and bank and bank holding company loan portfolios that had produced substantial losses over the past three years and an improving economic environment 
negative evidence included our cumulative losses in the past three years  no available taxes paid in open carryback years and no significant tax planning opportunities to accelerate income 
management determined that the positive evidence outweighed the negative and therefore we released our million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset on december  resulting in an income tax benefit 
during  we recorded a total income tax benefit of million  largely due to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
in addition  income tax benefit for includes a benefit due to a change in the state of illinois tax rate as applied to our beginning of the year net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance 
offsetting these benefits was income tax expense due to the release of the residual tax effects of changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance previously allocated to oci 
these residual tax effects resulted from changes in the deferred tax liability associated with deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges recorded in oci 
during  despite a loss of million before income taxes  we recorded total income tax expense of million 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
the tax expense recorded in was largely due to the release of the residual tax effects of changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance previously allocated to oci 
these residual tax effects resulted from changes in the deferred tax liability associated with deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges recorded in oci 
at december   the net deferred tax asset  after considering the million valuation allowance  was million  which was supported by available tax planning strategies 
during  we reported income tax expense of  for the year on a pre tax loss of million 
because of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  we were not able to record an income tax benefit related to the pre tax loss incurred 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
the tax expense recorded in was largely due to the release of the residual tax effects of changes in the beginning of the year valuation allowance previously allocated to oci 
these residual tax effects resulted from changes in the deferred tax liability associated with deferred gains on terminated cash flow hedges recorded in oci 
at december   the net deferred tax asset  after considering the million valuation allowance  was million  which was supported by available tax planning strategies 
segment review as described in note  segment reporting  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we have two principal operating segments banking and mortgage banking 
the banking segment consists of commercial banking  asset based lending  retail banking and all other functions that support those units 
net income for the banking segment for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from net loss of million for the year ended december  the improved performance is primarily attributable to a million decrease in provision for loan losses 
noninterest income decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
table of contents million 
this decrease was due to gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities of million in compared to million in  partially offset by an increase in other derivative income of million due to an increase in the number and size of fees collected on customer related swaps 
noninterest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease was due to a million decline in nonperforming asset expense due to improved credit quality  partially offset by million in early extinguishment of debt expense in the mortgage banking segment originates mortgage loans for sale to investors and for retention in our loan portfolio through its retail and broker channels 
this segment also services residential mortgage loans for various investors and for our own loans 
net income for the mortgage banking segment for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of  from net income of million for the year ended december  as the mortgage banking segment continues to build the infrastructure necessary for continued business growth 
net interest income increased million  from million in to million in noninterest income also increased  moving from million in to million in  an increase of million 
these increases in revenue reflect this segment s expansion of its national platform  diversification of its revenue streams and sustained low mortgage interest rates 
noninterest expense increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefits expense  a portion of which is related to volume growth 
the other category includes subordinated debt expense  certain parent company activities and residual income tax expense  representing the difference between the actual amount incurred and the amount allocated to operating segments 
the income tax benefit due to the reversal of our net deferred tax asset valuation allowance is also included 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes presented elsewhere in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  in management s opinion  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influences of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other factors 
financial condition total assets increased by million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at december  during  total loan balances increased million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at year end investment securities increased million  or  to a total of billion at december   compared to billion as of december  other real estate and repossessed assets increased by million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  in addition  other assets increased by million  or  at december  to million  compared to million at december  total liabilities remained flat at billion as of december  and december  total deposits increased million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  notes payable and other advances increased million  or  in to million at december   compared to million at december  other borrowings decreased

these investments are stated at cost 
our total investment portfolio increased million  or  to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  during the year ended december  we purchased million of investment securities  mostly mortgage related securities 
unrealized gains increased million 
offsetting these increases  we received million of proceeds from the sale of primarily mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations and million of maturities  payoffs and principal paydowns 
mortgage related securities include residential and commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  and comprised of our investment portfolio at december   compared to at december  as of december   over of mortgage related securities that we held were securities issued by government and government sponsored enterprises  such as ginnie mae  fannie mae  and freddie mac 
we do not hold subprime loans in our mortgage related investment securities portfolio 
while the fair value of these securities has been impacted by market illiquidity  we also take additional steps to review for other than temporary impairment 
at december   we had a net unrealized gain on the available for sale securities of million  or of amortized cost  compared to a net unrealized loss on the available for sale securities of million  or of amortized cost  at december  at december   we held five investment securities with a carrying value of million that were in a gross unrealized loss position of million 
we analyzed each of these securities to determine if other than temporary impairment had occurred 
our analysis included an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings  changes in credit ratings  and a cash flow analysis  considering default rates  loss severities based on the location of the collateral and estimated prepayments 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months and for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if we expect to receive all the contractual cash flows 
we obtained fair value estimates from additional independent sources and performed cash flow analysis to determine if other than temporary impairment had occurred 
of the five securities with gross unrealized losses at december   only three securities have been in a loss position for months or more 
our analysis at december  determined that the one security for which we had previously recognized other than temporary impairment was additionally impaired 
therefore  we recorded an additional  of other than temporary impairment in our analysis at december  indicated that the other two 
table of contents securities did not have other than temporary impairment 
for additional details  see notes to consolidated financial statements investment securities from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
one additional investment security was evaluated for other than temporary impairment at december  this security is in the company s state and municipal obligation portfolio and was received in in a loan work out arrangement 
scheduled payments were received as agreed from until the may interest payment  which was not received 
since the company now believes that it will not recover all the expected payments of principal and interest as specified in the bond agreement  the expected future annual cash flows were analyzed and other than temporary impairment of  was recorded against earnings in at december   we held no securities of any single issuer that exceeded of stockholders equity  other than us government agencies 
although we hold securities issued by municipalities within the state of illinois that  in the aggregate  exceeded of stockholders equity  none of the holdings from any individual municipal issuer exceeded this threshold 
as a member  we are required to hold stock in the fhlbc and the frb  which as of december  and consisted of the following december  december  in thousands federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc federal reserve bank frb the amount of fhlbc stock required to be held is based on the bank s asset size and the amount of borrowings from the fhlbc 
currently  the fhlbc is under a cease and desist order with its regulator that requires prior regulatory approval to declare dividends and redeem member capital stock other than excess capital under limited circumstances 
based on our assessment at december  of the ultimate recoverability of our fhlbc stock  we believe no impairment has occurred 
for additional details of these investments  see the notes to consolidated financial statements investment securities from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we did not hold any fhlbc debt securities in our investment portfolio as of december  the amount of frb stock required to be held is based on the bank s common stock and surplus 
the increases in the bank s surplus during were primarily due to the conversion of both series f preferred and series c preferred to common stock and the rights offering  which caused the bank to increase its holdings of frb stock by million

portfolio loans decreased million from billion at december  to billion at december  approximately of our loan portfolio was comprised of commercial loans  which include commercial and industrial c i  commercial real estate secured  and real estate construction and land loans 
total commercial loans decreased to billion at december   compared to billion at december  and billion at december  although we originated new loans during  including the funding of approximately million of new commercial loans  this growth was more than offset as we repositioned our portfolio to reduce our exposure in industries and sectors that we no longer consider desirable 
in addition  loan charge offs and low line usage by our customers combined to produce lower commercial loan balances in c i loans are made to businesses or to individuals for business purposes 
c i loans are made on either a secured or unsecured basis for a wide range of business purposes  terms  and maturities 
these loans are made primarily in the form of seasonal or working capital loans or term loans 
repayment of these loans is generally provided through the operating cash flow of the borrower 
the risk characteristics of c i loans are largely influenced by general economic conditions  such as inflation  recessionary pressures  the rate of unemployment  changes in interest rates and money supply  and other factors that affect the borrower s operations and the value of the underlying collateral 
the company s credit risk strategy emphasizes consistent underwriting standards and diversification by industry and customer size 
the company s c i loan portfolio is comprised of loans made to a variety of businesses in a diverse range of industries 
this portfolio diversification is a significant factor used to mitigate the risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions 

table of contents c i loans also include those loans made by the company s asset based lending division 
asset based loans are made to businesses with the primary source of repayment derived from payments on the related assets securing the loan 
collateral for these loans may include receivables  inventory  equipment and other fixed assets  and is monitored regularly to ensure ongoing sufficiency of collateral coverage and quality 
the primary risk for these loans is a significant decline in collateral values due to general market conditions 
loan terms that mitigate these risks include typical industry amortization schedules  percentage of collateral coverage  maintenance of cash collateral accounts and regular asset monitoring 
because of the national scope of the company s asset based lending  the risk of these loans is also diversified by geography 
c i loans increased million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at december  we continue to develop new customer relationships and originate c i loans as part of our growth strategy 
c i loans were billion at december  and increased million  or  to billion at december  commercial real estate loans on completed properties include loans for the purchase of real property or for other business purposes where the primary collateral is the underlying real property 
the company s commercial real estate loans consist of loans on commercial owner occupied properties and investment properties 
investment properties refer to multi family residences and income producing non owner occupied commercial real estate  including retail strip centers or malls  office and mixed use properties and other commercial and specialized properties  such as nursing homes  gas stations and convenience stores  churches  hotel  and motels 
repayment of these loans is generally provided through the operating cash flow of the property 
the risk in a commercial real estate loan depends primarily on the loan amount in relation to the value of the underlying collateral  the interest rate  and the borrower s ability to repay in a timely fashion 
the credit risk of these loans is influenced by general economic and market conditions and the resulting impact on a borrower s operation of the owner occupied business or upon the fluctuation in value and earnings performance of an income producing property 
in addition  the value of the underlying collateral is influenced by local real estate market trends and general economic conditions 
credit risk is managed in this portfolio through underwriting standards  knowledge of the local real estate markets  periodic reviews of the loan collateral and the borrowers financial condition 
in addition  all commercial real estate loans are supported by an independent third party appraisal at inception

although there was no impact to the calculation of the total commercial real estate loans  we have adjusted the table above to reflect the revised classifications for all periods presented 

table of contents total commercial real estate loans were billion at december  as compared to billion at december   a decrease of million  or 
during  loans secured by commercial owner occupied properties increased by million  while loans on commercial non owner occupied properties decreased by million and multi family property related loans decreased million 
most of the decrease in non owner occupied was in the retail strip centers or malls property category 
total commercial real estate loans were billion at december  as compared to billion at december   a decrease of million  or 
during  loans secured by commercial owner occupied properties increased by million  while loans on commercial non owner occupied properties decreased by million 
most of the decrease in non owner occupied was in the office mix use property category 
residential real estate construction and land loans primarily consist of loans to real estate developers to construct single family homes  town homes and condominium conversions 
commercial real estate construction and land loans primarily consist of loans to construct commercial real estate or income producing properties 
both the residential and commercial real estate construction and land loans are repaid from proceeds from the sale of the finished units by the developer or may be converted to commercial real estate loans at the completion of the construction process 
the risk characteristics of these loans are influenced by national and local economic conditions  including the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence and the related impact that these conditions have on demand  housing prices and real estate values 
in addition  credit risk on individual projects is influenced by the developers ability and efficiency in completing construction  selling finished units or obtaining tenants to occupy these properties 
credit risk for these loans is primarily managed by underwriting standards  lending primarily in local markets to developers with whom the company has experience and ongoing oversight of project progress 
our residential real estate construction and loan portfolio decreased million  or  during to million at december   as compared to million at december  because of the continued slow down in the residential real estate markets and reduced real estate valuations  we have been actively reducing our exposure to this sector 
residential real estate construction loans decreased million or  from million at december  to million at december  we continue to reduce our commercial construction and land portfolio  which declined million  or  to million at december   as compared to million at december  commercial construction and land loans decreased million  or  in  from million at december  to million at december  the company s consumer loans consist of open and closed end credit extended to individuals for household  family  and other personal expenditures 
consumer loans primarily include loans to individuals secured by their personal residence  including first mortgages and home equity and home improvement loans 
the primary risks in consumer lending are loss of income of the borrower that can result from job losses or unforeseen personal hardships due to medical or family issues that may impact repayment 
in the case of first and second mortgage or home equity lending  a significant reduction in the value of the asset financed can influence a borrower s ability to repay the loan 
because the size of consumer loans is typically smaller than commercial loans  the risk of loss on an individual consumer loan is usually less than that of a commercial loan 
credit risk for these loans is managed by reviewing creditworthiness of the borrower  monitoring payment histories and obtaining adequate collateral positions 
our portfolio of residential real estate mortgages  which includes both mortgages originated by cole taylor mortgage and bulk purchased mortgage loans  totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  this increase was driven by a portion of the mortgages originated by cole taylor mortgage being held in portfolio  rather than sold in the secondary market 

table of contents our portfolio of home equity loans and lines of credit also continues to decline 
at december   this portfolio totaled million  compared to million at december  and million at december  this portfolio as a percentage of gross portfolio loans decreased to at year end the following table shows our maturity distribution of loans as of the dates indicated as of december  one year or less over year through years over years fixed rate floating or adjustable rate fixed rate floating or adjustable rate total in thousands commercial and industrial commercial real estate residential construction and land commercial construction and land consumer total loans excluding loans held for sale maturities are based upon contractual dates 
demand loans are included in the one year or less category and totaled million as of december  loans held for sale at december   we held million of residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale as compared to million of residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale at december  this decline was due to improved efficiencies in the secondary marketing process in and faster turnover of mortgage loans held for sale 
loans held for sale at december  and are entirely derived from cole taylor mortgage 
this business sources mortgages through both retail offices and brokers throughout the united states  as well as through the chicago based banking centers 
we intend to sell these loans as part of our normal mortgage operations and have elected to account for these loans at fair value 
nonperforming assets our lending officers and their managers are responsible for the ongoing review of present and projected future performance of the loans within their assigned portfolio and for risk rating such loans in accordance with the bank s risk rating system 
in addition  a loan review function independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the reasonableness of the lending officer s risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the responsible lending officer reports to a loan committee about the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level 
the committee evaluates whether the loan is appropriately risk rated and determines if the loan should be placed on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
most loans rated substandard or below are transferred to a separate loan work out department  staffed by collection professionals 
our loan work out department is staffed at a level that can effectively handle nonperforming asset volume 
when the loan is transferred to work out  an independent legal review of the loan documents is performed and current appraisals are obtained for loans secured by real estate

we evaluate all loans on which principal or interest is contractually past due days or more to determine if they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
if sufficient doubt exists as to the full collection of principal and interest on a loan  we place it on nonaccrual and no longer recognize interest income 
after a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any current period interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
interest is included in income subsequent to the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status only as interest is received and so long as management is satisfied that there is a high probability that principal will be collected in full 
the loan is returned to accrual status only when the borrower has made required payments for a minimum length of time and demonstrates the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled

the level of nonaccrual loans in our consumer portfolio decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  approximately of the consumer nonaccrual loans are from our portfolio of home mortgage loans and of this amount  most of the nonaccrual loans are related to bulk purchased mortgage loans  not to loans originated by cole taylor mortgage

the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans also decreased during and totaled million at december   as compared to million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the allowance for losses on impaired loans in was primarily due to net charge offs during the period  partially offset by an increase in the estimated impairment on impaired loans at december  the percentage of allowance on impaired loans to total impaired loans decreased to at december   compared to at december  c i loans comprised approximately of all impaired loans and of the allowance for loan losses on impaired loans at december  once we determine that a loan is impaired  we perform an individual analysis to establish the amount of the related allowance for loan losses  if any  based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that collateral dependent loans may be measured for impairment based upon the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
generally  since the majority of our impaired loans are collateral dependent real estate loans  the fair value is determined by a current appraisal 
for impaired loans that are collateral dependent  the company s practice is to obtain an updated appraisal every nine to months  depending on the nature and type of the collateral and the stability of collateral valuations  as determined by senior members of credit management 
oreo and repossessed assets require an updated appraisal at least annually 
the company has established policies and procedures related to appraisals and maintains a list of approved appraisers who have met specific criteria 
in addition  the company s policy for appraisals on real estate dependent commercial loans generally requires each appraisal to have an independent compliance and technical review by a qualified third party to ensure the consistency and quality of the appraisal and valuation 
the company discounts appraisals for estimated selling costs  and  when appropriate  considers the date of the appraisal and stability of the local real estate market when analyzing the estimated fair value of individual impaired loans that are collateral dependent 

table of contents the individual impairment analysis also considers available and reliable borrower guarantees and any cross collateralization agreements 
certain other loans are collateralized by business assets  such as equipment  inventory  and accounts receivable 
the fair value of these loans is based upon estimates of realizability and collectability of the underlying collateral 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  the impairment analysis may not result in a related allowance for loan losses for each individual loan 
at december   we determined that million of our loans had impairment and had related allowances for loan losses of million 
we also held million of impaired loans for which the individual analysis did not result in a measure of impairment  so no related allowance for loan losses was provided 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans  accruing loans judged to have higher risk of noncompliance with the present contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal  as well as troubled debt restructurings 
unless modified in a troubled debt restructuring  certain homogenous loans  such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and are  therefore  excluded from impaired loans 
at december   we held million of loans classified as performing restructured loans which included commercial loans of million and consumer loans of million 
at december   we had  in commitments to lend on impaired loans with  of that amount in commitments to lend on loans considered troubled debt restructurings 
the balance of nonaccrual loans and impaired loans as of december  is presented below nonaccrual loans impaired loans in thousands commercial nonaccrual loans commercial loans on accrual but impaired n a  consumer oriented loans n a not applicable potential problem loans as part of our standard credit administration process  we risk rate our commercial loan portfolio 
as part of this process  loans that are rated with a higher level of risk are monitored more closely 
we internally identify certain loans in our loan risk ratings that we have placed on heightened monitoring because of certain weaknesses that may inhibit the borrower s ability to perform under the contractual terms of the loan agreement but have not reached the status of nonaccrual loans 
as of december   these potential problem loans totaled million of which million were in our commercial construction and land portfolio  million were in our commercial and industrial portfolio  and the remaining million were loans in the commercial real estate secured portfolio 
in comparison  potential problem loans at december  totaled million 
the largest category of potential problem loans at december  was commercial real estate secured which was million 
the remaining loans were construction and land loans of million and c i loans of million 
we do not necessarily expect to realize losses on potential problem loans  but we recognize potential problem loans can carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include the formula described below and specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio categories 

table of contents we calculate the formula portion of the allowance by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  residential real estate construction  commercial real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage  and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification for commercial loans and by delinquency status for consumer loans 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  such as residential mortgage loans and home equity loans 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  grouping loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates based upon current and prior year s charge off experience for each separate loan grouping identified 
the historical loss rates are then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
the allowance in and reflects loss experience from the prior three year period while the allowance in reflects loss experience from the preceding two year period 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the loan groupings  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
impaired loans are evaluated with an individual analysis to establish the amount of related allowance for loan loss  if any 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of either expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
in recent periods  our estimate of the amount of loss on a loan secured by real estate has increased in complexity as a result of the current illiquidity in the real estate market 
the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of real estate valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method can have a material impact on our loss estimates on loans 
if the estimated recoverable amount of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
however  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

total nonperforming loans decreased from million at december   to million at december   while the level of impaired loans decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to charge offs and paydowns 
our continued efforts to resolve our nonperforming assets and impaired loans  resulted in a decreased provision for loan losses  lower charge offs in  and an overall decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
we charge off loans when the loss is highly probable and clearly identified 
for additional details  see the allowance for loan losses section of the note  summary of significant accounting and reporting policies from our audited financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report

table of contents were million  or of average loans 
in comparison  during net charge offs were million  or of average loans  and million  or of average loans during in  most of our loan charge offs were from the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios 
in contrast  in and  most of our loan charge offs were from our construction and loan portfolios 
as a commercial bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have higher potential for losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
the table below presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

in october  we entered the cdars network 
this network allows us to accommodate depositors with large cash balances to seek full deposit insurance protection  by placing these funds in cds issued by other banks in the network 
through a matching system  we receive funds back for cds that we issue for other banks in the network  thus allowing us to retain the full amount of the original deposit 
at december   we had million of deposits in the cdars reciprocal program  as compared to million at december  we also utilize out of market cds to fund the portion of our interest earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides cd rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts that allow the purchasers to obtain full fdic deposit insurance protection

repos include overnight and term agreements 
the overnight repos are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers 
overnight repos totaled million at december  and million at december  our term repos totaled million at december  and million at december  in  we modified the terms of a million existing structured repo agreement to extend the maturity date and reduce the interest rate 
in addition  three structured repo agreements in the total amount of million were terminated in we incurred million in early extinguishment of debt expense related to these terminations 
this change was made to shift funding sources to lower cost alternatives 
all remaining repo agreements are non callable  with million due to mature in and million due to mature in during  we paid million of repo agreements early and incurred  of expense recorded as early extinguishment of debt within noninterest expense 
at december   there were million of repo agreements that remained callable at the counterparty s option and were scheduled to mature in in addition  the repurchase agreements allowed the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to the call date if the bank were to lose its well capitalized status 
the remaining million repurchase agreements were non callable with million due to mature in and million due to mature in at december  and december   subject to available collateral  the bank had available pre approved total repurchase agreement lines of million and million  respectively

preferred stock in may  we completed an exchange offering in which all of our outstanding shares of series a preferred were exchanged for million shares of common stock that included million shares as an inducement for series a preferred holders to exchange the series a preferred for common shares 
the million value attributed to the additional shares was considered an implied noncash dividend to holders of the series a preferred and resulted in no net impact to total stockholders equity

regulatory capital we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier capital includes common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities up to certain limits 
bank regulators  however  also specifically approved the series b preferred for inclusion in tier capital in spite of its cumulative dividend feature 
tier capital is adjusted to exclude a portion of the deferred tax asset and the mortgage servicing rights asset 
total capital represents tier capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan loss up to certain limits  subordinated debt and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier capital 

table of contents at each december   december   and december   the company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
all of the company s ratios increased in  mostly due to net income for the year and capital raises totaling million 
the company s total capital ratio increased in  largely due to increases in regulatory capital caused by our subordinated debt issuance in which more than outweighed the increase in risk weighted assets 
the ratios of tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average assets declined compared to the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets as tier capital was lower during as well as higher average assets and risk weighted assets 
at each of december   december   and december   the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
all of the bank s ratios increased during due to the net income earned by the bank and the million capital contribution from the company 
while we  as well as our bank  continue to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory capital guidelines  our regulators could require us to maintain capital in excess of these required levels 
we have agreed  consistent with past practice  to continue to provide our regulators notice before the payment of dividends

during  we worked to improve our liquidity position by increasing funding from core customers which allowed us to reduce our reliance on brokered deposits 
we also used available collateral to take advantage of attractively priced short term funding provided by the fhlb 
we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
at december   subject to 
table of contents available collateral  we had total pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines and repurchase agreement lines of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the bank is able to borrow from the frb under the borrower in custody program 
at december   the bank maintained million of commercial loans as collateral at the frb with a lendable value of approximately million 
the bank also has pledged million of investment securities and million of qualified first mortgage residential  home equity and commercial real estate loans at the fhlb and had a total borrowing capacity of million at december  the bank has further increased its ability to purchase federal funds by cultivating relationships with a growing group of correspondent banking customers who may sell federal funds to the bank in order to manage their excess liquidity

management of investing and financing activities and market conditions determine the level and the stability of our net interest cash flows 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to cash used in operating activities of million in and cash used of million in the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in is due to an increase in cash proceeds from loan sales of billion  partially offset by an increase in loans originated for sale of million

holding company liquidity historically  the primary source of funds has been dividends received from the bank 
because of the net losses incurred by the bank in recent years  the bank did not declare or pay any dividends to the company in or the bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth by regulatory authorities  under which the 
table of contents bank may not  without prior approval of regulatory authorities  declare dividends in excess of the sum of the current year s earnings plus the retained earnings from the prior two years 
as of december   the bank could not declare or pay dividends to us  without the approval of regulatory authorities 
at december   company had cash of million for general corporate purposes and to support future growth 
the primary source of cash at the holding company was from the issuance of series f preferred and the rights offering of common stock 
in  we received net proceeds  after issuance costs  of million from the issuance of our series f preferred and million from the issuance of our common stock due to the rights offering 
during  cash outflows at the company included million in capital contributions to the bank  million of cash dividend payments on preferred stock issuances and general operating expenses 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements include commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million at december  and million at december  commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts  and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not usually represent future cash requirements 
we had million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and million at december  financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn  and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees to the extent not already recognized as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   we had a liability for million for commitments under standby letters of credit for which we believed funding and loss were probable  compared to million at december  the following table shows as of december  the loan commitments and financial guarantees by maturity date

derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to accommodate customer needs and to assist in our own interest rate risk management 
from time to time  we use interest rate exchange agreements  or swaps  and callable interest rate swaps  interest rate floors and corridors to manage the interest rate risk associated with our commercial loan portfolio  brokered cds  cash flows related to fhlb advances and repurchase agreements and mortgage servicing 
we also have interest rate lock commitments and forward loan commitments that are considered derivatives

we had million of notional amount interest rate corridors at december   which were designated as cash flow hedges against certain borrowings 
there was no ineffectiveness on these interest rate corridors for the year ended december  in order to accommodate individual customer borrowing needs  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with customers 
at the same time  in order to offset the exposure and manage interest rate risk  we entered into an interest rate swap with a different counterparty with offsetting terms 
these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges and any changes in fair value of these instruments  as well as any net cash settlements and upfront customer fees  are recognized in noninterest income as other derivative income or expense 
as of december  and  we had notional amounts of million and million  respectively  of interest rate swaps with customers in which we agreed to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate

no covered call options were entered into in in january  we terminated a million notional amount interest rate swap that was not designated as an accounting hedge 
we discontinued hedge accounting in december  when we determined the hedge would no longer be effective 
the unrealized gain of million upon de designation  which had accumulated in oci net of tax  was being amortized to loan interest income over what would have been the life of the hedge 
from the date of de designation to december   the change in fair value  along with net settlements attributed to this period  was recorded in other derivative income in noninterest income and totaled  this derivative was terminated in january and we received a cash payment million  which represented the fair value of the swap at the date of termination 
at december  the net settlement had been completely amortized and there is no longer any amount remaining in accumulated oci 
this compares with december  when we had  in accumulated oci related to terminated cash flow hedges 
the amount in accumulated oci represents the net unamortized portion of the deferred gain that had accumulated in oci when the hedging relationship was terminated 
during and  million and million  respectively  of deferred gains from previously terminated cash flow hedges were amortized as a net increase to loan interest income 
hedges with the notional amount of million were terminated in  with net termination fees of  recognized in noninterest income for the year ended december  these hedges were terminated because the transaction which they hedged was no longer forecast to occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 

table of contents we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps  floors  collars and corridors to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts can be designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remain unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to decrease by  or  as compared to the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was an increase of million  or higher than the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines 
no simulation for net interest income at risk in a falling rate scenario was calculated because of the low level of market interest rates at both december  and computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and december  change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year n a n a n a n a n a not applicable 
table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience 
volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb frb stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings notes payable other advances junior subordinated debentures subordinated notes  net total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on a gap analysis 
management considers earnings at risk simulation modeling to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor interest rate risk from an economic perspective with an economic value of equity analysis 
this measure is used to evaluate long term interest rate risk 
litigation we are from time to time a party to litigation arising in the normal course of business 
management knows of no such threatened or pending legal actions against us that are likely to have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  liquidity or operating results

in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements 
asu no 
removes two criteria from the assessment of effective control when determining whether a repurchase agreement should be accounted for as a sale or as a secured borrowing 
the remaining criteria indicate that the transferor is deemed to have maintained effective control over the financial assets transferred and thus must account for the transaction as a secured borrowing if all of certain conditions are met 
this asu is effective for the interim or annual period that begins after december   with no early adoption permitted 
this accounting standard is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

this asu became effective for the periods beginning on or after june  and was applied retrospectively to the beginning of the annual period of adoption 
this asu further states that all troubled debt restructuring disclosures required by asu that had been deferred by asu no 
 should be disclosed effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  this accounting standard was adopted as of the third quarter and the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
