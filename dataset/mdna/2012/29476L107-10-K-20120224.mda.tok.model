this item a 
includes forward looking statements 
you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements included in item the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect  possibly in a material manner  our business  financial condition or results of operations  which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as shares  preference units  limited partnership interests in the operating partnership op units  long term incentive plan units ltip units and our public unsecured debt 
in this section  we refer to the shares  preference units  op units  ltip units and public unsecured debt together as our securities and the investors who own shares units  op ltip units and public unsecured debt as our security holders 
our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry general real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid 
numerous factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties and the ability to realize that value 
these factors include changes in the global  national  regional and local economic climates  local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties  the attractiveness of our properties to residents  competition from other multifamily properties and single family homes and changes in market rental rates 
our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  all of which could increase over time 
sources of labor and materials required for maintenance  repair  capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated 
also  the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions and our dividend policy may lead to quicker dividend reductions we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders 
however  there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions  which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions and or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference 
should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature  our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels 
while our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute  it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate 
see item for additional discussion regarding our dividend policy 
we may be unable to renew leases or relet apartment units as leases expire when our residents decide to leave our apartments  whether because they decide not to renew their leases or they leave prior to their lease expiration date  we may not be able to relet their apartment units 
even if the residents do renew or we can relet the apartment units  the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms 
if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the apartment units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if residents do not experience increases in their income  we may be unable to increase rent and or delinquencies may increase 
occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including  without limitation  new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing  rental housing subsidized by the government  other 
table of contents government programs that favor single family rental housing or owner occupied housing over multifamily rental housing  slow or negative employment growth and household formation  the availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers  changes in social preferences and the potential for geopolitical instability  all of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents 
finally  the federal government s policies  many of which may encourage home ownership  can increase competition and possibly limit our ability to raise rents 
consequently  our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 
new acquisitions and or development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties we intend to actively acquire and or develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate 
we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up 
we may be unable to lease up these apartment properties on schedule  resulting in decreases in expected rental revenues and or lower yields due to lower occupancy and rates as well as higher than expected concessions 
we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property 
additionally  we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts 
this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties 
we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 
we have acquired in the past and intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of properties and portfolios of properties  including large portfolios  that could increase our size and result in alterations to our capital structure 
the total number of apartment units under development  costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials  competition and local government regulation 
in connection with such government regulation  we may incur liability if our properties are not constructed and operated in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the americans with disabilities act  the fair housing act or other federal  state or local requirements 
noncompliance could result in fines  subject us to lawsuits and require us to remediate or repair the noncompliance 
risks involved in real estate activity through joint ventures we have in the past and may in the future develop and acquire properties in joint ventures with other persons or entities when we believe circumstances warrant the use of such structures 
joint venture investments involve risks  including the possibility that our partners might refuse to make capital contributions when due  that we may be responsible to our partners for indemnifiable losses  that our partners might at any time have business or economic goals which are inconsistent with ours  and that our partners may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests 
frequently  we and our partners may each have the right to trigger a buy sell arrangement  which could cause us to sell our interest  or acquire our partners interest  at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 
in some instances  joint venture partners may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflicts of interest 
further  the company s joint venture partners may experience financial distress  including bankruptcy  and to the extent they do not meet their obligations to us or our joint ventures with them  we may be adversely affected 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
this inability to reallocate our capital promptly could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 
the value of investment securities could result in losses to the company from time to time  the company holds investment securities and or cash investments that have a higher risk profile than the government obligations and bond funds  money market funds or bank deposits in which we generally invest 
on occasion we may purchase securities of companies in our own industry as a means to invest funds 
there may be times when we experience declines in the value of these investment securities  which may result in losses to the company and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
sometimes the cash we deposit at a bank exceeds the fdic insurance limit resulting in risk to the company of loss of funds if these banks fail 

table of contents changes in market conditions and volatility of share prices could adversely affect the market price of our common shares the stock markets  including the new york stock exchange  on which we list our common shares  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the market price of our common shares may decline or fluctuate significantly in response to many factors  including but not limited to the following general market and economic conditions  actual or anticipated variations in our guidance  quarterly operating results or dividends  changes in our funds from operations  normalized funds from operations or earnings estimates  difficulties or inability to access capital or extend or refinance debt  decreasing or uncertainty in real estate valuations  a change in analyst ratings  adverse market reaction to any additional debt we incur in the future  governmental regulatory action  including changes or proposed changes to the mandates of fannie mae or freddie mac  and changes in tax laws  and the issuance of additional common shares  or the perception that such issuances might occur  including under eqr s atm program 
changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases any real estate or other federal  state or local taxes 
consequently  any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
we may become involved in legal proceedings  including but not limited to  proceedings related to consumer  employment  environmental  development  condominium conversion  tort and commercial legal issues that  if decided adversely to or settled by us  could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 
any weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our share price section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting 
if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our share price 
environmental problems are possible and can be costly federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property 
the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consulting companies 
while these environmental assessments have not revealed  nor are we aware of  any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 

table of contents there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements  insurance carriers have reacted by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates 
while we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property  should mold become an issue in the future  our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities  that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us  or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 
climate change to the extent that climate change does occur  we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature  all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions 
should the impact of climate change be material in nature  including destruction of our properties  or occur for lengthy periods of time  our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue 
insurance policy deductibles  exclusions and counterparties as of december   the company s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of  and self insured retention of million per occurrence  subject to a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of million  with approximately of any excess losses being covered by insurance 
any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate self insured retention 
the company s general liability and worker s compensation policies at december  provide for a million and million per occurrence deductible  respectively 
these higher deductible and self insured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses  but management has reviewed its claims history over the years and believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the long term 
however  the potential impact of climate change and increased severe weather could cause a significant increase in insurance premiums and deductibles  particularly for our coastal properties  or a decrease in the availability of coverage  either of which could expose the company to even greater uninsured losses which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
as a result of the terrorist attacks of september   property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our all risk property insurance policies 
as of december   under a separate terrorism insurance policy  the company was insured for million in terrorism insurance coverage  with a  deductible 
this coverage excludes losses from nuclear  biological and chemical attacks 
in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties  we could lose the revenues from the property  our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 
the company has become more susceptible to large losses as it has transformed its portfolio  becoming more concentrated in fewer  more valuable assets over a smaller geographical footprint 
as of december   the company s cyber liability insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of  and a million general limit 
cyber liability insurance generally covers costs associated with the wrongful release  through inadvertent breach or network attack of personally identifiable information such as social security or credit card numbers 
this cyber policy would cover the cost of victim notification  credit monitoring and other crisis response expenses 
in addition  the company relies on third party insurance providers for its property  general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
while there has yet to be any non performance by these major insurance providers  should any of them experience liquidity issues or other financial distress  it could negatively impact the company 
non performance by our operating counterparties could adversely affect our performance we have relationships with and  from time to time  we execute transactions with or receive services from many counterparties 
as a result  defaults by counterparties could result in services not being provided  or volatility in the financial 
table of contents markets could affect counterparties ability to complete transactions with us as intended  both of which could result in disruptions to our operations that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
debt financing and preferred shares preference units could adversely affect our performance general please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december  in addition to debt  we have million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest preference units with a weighted average dividend preference of per annum as of december  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks  including the following disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions dislocations and liquidity disruptions in capital and credit markets could impact liquidity in the debt markets  resulting in financing terms that are less attractive to us and or the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds again become limited  or be available only on unattractive terms  we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt and or react to changing economic and business conditions 
uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell  as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate significantly and or to decline 
potential reforms to fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect our performance there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises or gses 
should the gses have their mandates changed or reduced  lose key personnel  be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue providing liquidity to our sector  it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and or increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets and or the values realized upon sale 
disruptions in the floating rate tax exempt bond market where interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market s perception of the gses  which guarantee and provide liquidity for many of these bonds  have been experienced in the past and may be experienced in the future and could result in an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations 
these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if the gses fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations 
while this obligation is in almost all cases non recourse to us  this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 
non performance by our financial counterparties could adversely affect our performance although we have not experienced any material counterparty non performance  disruptions in financial and credit markets could  among other things  impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations 
there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility 
should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
should several of these institutions fail to fund  we could experience significant financial distress 
the company also has developed assets with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that have experienced varying degrees of distress in the past and could experience similar distress as economic conditions change 
if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required  the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 

table of contents a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance a significant downgrade in our credit ratings  while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility  would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt  or otherwise limit our access to capital 
in addition  a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral and or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self insured property and liability insurance deductibles or to obtain lower deductible insurance compliant with the lenders requirements at the lower ratings level 
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition in the future  our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 
we may not be able to refinance existing debt  including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and  if we can  the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our operating cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt 
as a result  certain of our other debt may cross default  we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties  we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property 
foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company s debt maturity schedule as of december  financial covenants could adversely affect the company s financial condition the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage 
in addition  our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt 
the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing  and to sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facilities and indentures are cross defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt 
while the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december  and  should it fall out of compliance  it would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
some of the properties were financed with tax exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions 
the company  and from time to time its consultants  monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties 
if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income residents  or eligible qualified residents  then our income from these properties may be limited 
while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with tax exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions  this may not always be the case 
some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders 
for example  the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes  making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 
our consolidated debt to total market capitalization ratio was as of december  in addition  our most restrictive unsecured public debt covenants are as follows 
table of contents december  december  total debt to adjusted total assets not to exceed secured debt to adjusted total assets not to exceed consolidated income available for debt service to maximum annual service charges must be at least to total unsecured assets to unsecured debt must be at least rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods  plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership s credit rating  or based upon bids received from the lending group 
certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also  from time to time  bear interest at floating rates 
we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt 
accordingly  higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and make distributions to security holders 
derivatives and hedging activity could adversely affect cash flow in the normal course of business  we use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on debt instruments  including hedging for future debt issuances 
at other times we may utilize derivatives to increase our exposure to floating interest rates 
there can be no assurance that these hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact 
these arrangements  which can include a number of counterparties  may expose us to additional risks  including failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts  and may involve extensive costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if we terminate them 
no strategy can completely insulate us from the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we depend on our key personnel we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees  samuel zell  and our executive officers  particularly david j 
neithercut  our president and chief executive officer ceo 
if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us  our operations could be temporarily adversely affected 
mr 
zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 
control and influence by significant security holders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other security holders the consent of certain affiliates of mr 
zell is required for certain amendments to the sixth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the partnership agreement 
as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement  the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company 
although to the company s knowledge these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter  they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company s affairs if they were to act together in the future 
this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders 
for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees  including mr 
zell  and our executive officers  see equity residential s definitive proxy statement 
shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the then prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders 
this includes the ownership limit described below 
while our existing preferred shares preference units do not have these provisions  any future series of preferred shares preference units may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 
our bylaws require certain information to be provided by any security holder  or persons 
table of contents acting in concert with such security holder  who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders  including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities 
these requirements could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 
we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year 
to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification  our declaration of trust  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares 
we refer to this restriction as the ownership limit 
absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees  securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary  and the security holder s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate 
a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the ownership limit 
the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and  therefore  could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for their shares 
to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an anti takeover device  the company s ownership limit requires  rather than permits  the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company s status as a reit 
our preferred shares may affect changes in control our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to million preferred shares  and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued 
the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company  even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 
inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit business combinations including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities  or with an affiliate who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company s outstanding voting securities an interested shareholder  or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder 
these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder 
after the five year period  a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two super majority shareholder votes unless  among other conditions  holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
as permitted by maryland law  however  the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr 
zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them 
consequently  the five year prohibition and the super majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and or any of them 
such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 
our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december  based  in part  upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions 
we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
we cannot  therefore  guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
we are also required to distribute to security holders at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
we do not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 
in addition  congress and the irs have recently liberalized the reit qualification rules to permit reits in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status 

table of contents if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
also  unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions  we would remain disqualified from taxation as a reit for four years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes 
we  therefore  would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders 
this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders 
even if we qualify as a reit  we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
in addition  various business activities which generate income that is not qualifying income for a reit are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries and will be subject to federal and state income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they generate taxable income 
we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence  then they might have had undistributed subchapter c corporation earnings and profits at the time of their merger with us 
if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place  we might not qualify as a reit 
we believe based  in part  upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations  among other things  that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that  in any event  none of them had any undistributed subchapter c corporation earnings and profits at the time of their merger with us 
if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit  an additional concern would be that they could have been required to recognize taxable gain at the time they merged with us 
we would be liable for the tax on such gain 
we also could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 
compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company we may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received 
in such event  or upon our repayment of principal on debt  we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 
accordingly  we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company during and  we did make  and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future  a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year 
this election  which is provided for in the reit tax code  may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year 
however  this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 
federal income tax considerations general the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares 
it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations 
for example  it does not give a detailed discussion of any state  local or foreign tax considerations 
the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances 
moreover  it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws  such as insurance companies  tax exempt entities  financial institutions or broker dealers  foreign corporations  persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states and persons who own shares through a partnership or other entity treated as a flow through entity for federal income tax purposes 
the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase  ownership and disposition of common shares 
therefore  it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder s personal tax situation  as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state  local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 
the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code  current  temporary and proposed treasury 
table of contents regulations  the legislative history of the internal revenue code  current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service  including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings  which are not binding on the internal revenue service  and existing court decisions 
future legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law 
any change could apply retroactively 
thus  it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion  which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts  and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 
our taxation we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december  in any year in which we qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations  which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive 
we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries  primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities 
as a result  we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 
we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gains that we do not distribute to our shareholders 
in addition  we will be subject to a excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements 
we could also be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference 
in addition  any net income from prohibited transactions ie  dispositions of property  other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary  held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a tax 
we could also be subject to a penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service 
if we fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements  we will still generally be subject to a penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure 
if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount  due to reasonable cause  and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions  we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non qualifying assets 
if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause  we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of  for each such failure 
moreover  we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 
we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit 
however  given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements  we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 
if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply  we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we also may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax 
as a result  our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders 
unless entitled to statutory relief  we would not be able to re elect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification 
it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code 
we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 
ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us 
the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of a taxable reit subsidiary or trs  provided that the aggregate value of all of the trs securities held by the reit does not exceed of the reit s total asset value 
trss are corporations subject to tax as a regular c corporation that have elected  jointly with a reit  to be a trs 
generally  a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below  which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests 
however  the reit will be obligated to pay a penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us  our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties 
a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the federal income tax liability imposed on reits 
income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land  the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale 
table of contents of condominium units 
trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates 
the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount 
the trss will attempt to reduce  if possible  the amount of these taxes  but we cannot guarantee whether  or the extent to which  measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful 
to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes  less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 
share ownership test and organizational requirement 
in order to qualify as a reit  our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of persons for at least days of a taxable year that is months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
also  not more than in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules  by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year 
in addition  we must meet certain other organizational requirements  including  but not limited to  that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees 
we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future 
in order to ensure compliance with the person test and the share ownership test discussed above  we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership 
however  such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements  and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 
gross income tests 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy two gross income tests at least of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property  investments in real estate and or real estate mortgages  dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments excluding certain hedging income 
at least of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the test and dividends  non real estate mortgage interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities excluding certain hedging income 
to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests  rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident 
also  the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed of the total rent 
we may generally provide services to residents without tainting our rental income only if such services are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible services 
if such services are impermissible  then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount  or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements  or through a taxable reit subsidiary 
we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible  or  if considered impermissible services  will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
in this case  a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above 
generally  it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply  we will not qualify as a reit 
asset tests 
in general  at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items  not more than of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the asset class  except for securities included in item above  equity investments in other reits  qualified reit subsidiaries ie  corporations owned by a reit that are not trss or reits  or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer s securities owned by us may not exceed of the value of our total assets and b we may not own securities representing more than of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer  and not more than of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

table of contents the value test described in clause b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code 
under the safe harbor  the following are not considered securities held by us for purposes of this value test i straight debt securities  ii any loan of an individual or an estate  iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property  iv any obligation to pay rents from real property  v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof  foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity  or vi any security issued by a reit 
the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity  not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of of or of the annual yield to maturity or we own  or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer s debt and not more than months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt 
if we hold indebtedness from any issuer  including a reit  the indebtedness will be subject to  and may cause a violation of  the asset tests  unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor 
we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded 
if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit  we would not meet the voting stock limitation and the value limitation and we would  unless certain relief provisions applied  fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 
if we fail to satisfy the or asset tests described above after a day cure period provided in the internal revenue code  we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our non qualifying assets is de minimis ie  does not exceed the lesser of of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or  and we dispose of the non qualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered 
for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above  we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests  after the day cure period  by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period  paying a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service 
if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions  or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests  we would cease to qualify as a reit 
annual distribution requirements 
to qualify as a reit  we are generally required to distribute dividends  other than capital gain dividends  to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to of our reit taxable income 
these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made 
we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates 
we will be subject to a excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid  if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for the year  of our reit capital gain net income for the year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years 
a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains 
in that case  a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as long term capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit 
for purposes of the excise tax described above  any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 
ownership of partnership interests by us 
as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership  we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership  respectively  for purposes of the reit asset and income tests  including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 
state and local taxes 
we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions  including those in which we transact business or reside 
generally reits have seen increases in state and local taxes in recent years 
our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above 
consequently  prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 
taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax general 
if we qualify as a reit  distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common 
table of contents shares  other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries  will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits 
these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute qualified dividend income under the internal revenue code  meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements 
in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits  we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares 
the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs  will be designated as qualified dividend income to reit shareholders 
for tax years ending on or before december   these qualified dividends are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our non corporate shareholders 
to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits  such distributions will be considered a return of capital 
such distributions will be treated as a tax free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated 
to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder s tax basis  such distributions are taxable as gain from the sale of shares 
shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 
dividends declared by a reit in october  november  or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december of that year  so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year 
however  this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit s earnings and profits existing on december to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december  the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid 
as such  for tax reporting purposes  january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 
distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year 
this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year 
it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares 
despite this general rule  corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
generally  we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section gain distribution 
a rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals  estates or trusts at a maximum rate of which rate is currently scheduled to increase to for taxable years beginning on and after january  
an unrecaptured section gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals  estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 
if  for any taxable year  we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest  then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction 
the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year 
the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 
we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain 
if we make this election  shareholders must include in income  as long term capital gain  their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain 
shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains 
accordingly  they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount 
shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid 
our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 
in general  a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between a the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition  and b the shareholder s adjusted tax basis in the common shares 
the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset 
generally  the capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 
in general  a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less  
table of contents determined after applying certain holding period rules  will be treated as long term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as long term capital gains 
for shareholders who are individuals  trusts and estates  the long term capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable long term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 
taxation of domestic tax exempt shareholders most tax exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income  which is often referred to as ubti 
unless a tax exempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business  distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti 
similarly  if a tax exempt shareholder sells common shares  the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 
however  for tax exempt shareholders that are social clubs  voluntary employee benefit associations  supplemental unemployment benefit trusts  and qualified group legal services plans  income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares 
these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 
in addition  certain pension trusts that own more than of a pension held reit must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti 
we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension held reit for purposes of this rule 
taxation of foreign shareholders the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder 
for purposes of this discussion  a foreign shareholder is any person other than a a citizen or resident of the united states  b a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof  or c an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source 
distributions by us 
distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits 
these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a rate  or a lower treaty rate  unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business 
please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits 
dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates  and are generally not subject to withholding 
certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption 
a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate or a lower treaty rate 
we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of on any such distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless a a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us  or b the foreign shareholder files an irs form w eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income 
if such distribution is in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits  it will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder s common shares 
instead  the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares 
to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares  it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder s common shares 
the tax treatment of 
table of contents this gain is described below 
we intend to withhold at a rate of  or a lower applicable treaty rate  on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution 
in such event  a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was  in fact  in excess of our earnings and profits  and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 
any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market  will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above  if the foreign shareholder did not own more than of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution 
foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report such distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes  including any capital gain dividends  will be subject to a us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty  as described above 
in addition  the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 
distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends  other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest  generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless a the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder s united states trade or business  in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders  except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax  as discussed above  or b the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states  in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a tax on the individual s capital gains 
under the foreign investment in real property tax act  which is known as firpta  distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend 
accordingly  foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders  subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals 
in addition  a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above  as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements 
we are required to withhold of these distributions 
the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder s united states federal income tax liability 
although the law is not entirely clear on the matter  it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends 
under that approach  foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against their united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains 
in addition  if timely requested  foreign shareholders might be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 
foreign shareholders sales of common shares 
gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a united states real property interest within the meaning of firpta 
the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit 
a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders 
we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit 
therefore  we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta 
however  because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit 
in any event  gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax  if either a the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder s united states trade or business  in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain  or b the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states  in which case the nonresident alien individual will 
table of contents be subject to a tax on the individual s capital gains 
even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit  gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if a the class or series of shares being sold is regularly traded  as defined by applicable irs regulations  on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange  and b the selling foreign shareholder owned or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the five year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 

table of contents normalized funds from operations normalized ffo begins with ffo and excludes the impact of any expenses relating to non operating asset impairment and valuation allowances  property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write offs other expenses  gains and losses from early debt extinguishment  including prepayment penalties  preferred share preference unit redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non cash convertible debt discounts  gains and losses on the sales of non operating assets  including gains and losses from land parcel and condominium sales  net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses  and other miscellaneous non comparable items 
the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and units units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company  because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates 
ffo and ffo available to common shares and units units can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the company also believes that normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the company s operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company s actual operating results 
ffo  ffo available to common shares and units units  normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units do not represent net income  net income available to common shares units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo  ffo available to common shares and units units  normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income  net income available to common shares units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo  ffo available to common shares and units units  normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
ffo available to common shares and units units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares preference units in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the noncontrolling interests operating partnership 
subject to certain restrictions  the noncontrolling interests operating partnership may exchange their op units for common shares on a one for one basis

factors that might cause such differences include  but are not limited to the following we intend to actively acquire and or develop multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate 

table of contents we may also acquire multifamily properties that are unoccupied or in the early stages of lease up

we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property 
additionally  we expect that other real estate investors with capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development and acquisition efforts 
this competition or lack thereof may increase or depress prices for multifamily properties

eqr is the general partner of  and as of december  owned an approximate ownership interest in erpop 
all of the company s property ownership  development and related business operations are conducted through the operating partnership and eqr has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in erpop 
eqr issues public equity from time to time but does not have any indebtedness as all debt is incurred by the operating partnership 
the operating partnership holds substantially all of the assets of the company  including the company s ownership interests in its joint ventures 
the operating partnership conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity 
the company s corporate headquarters are located in chicago  illinois and the company also operates property management offices in each of its markets 
as of december   the company had approximately  employees who provided real estate operations  leasing  legal  financial  accounting  acquisition  disposition  development and other support functions 
business objectives and operating and investing strategies the company invests in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets with the goal of maximizing our risk adjusted total return operating income plus capital appreciation on invested capital 
our operating focus is on balancing occupancy and rental rates to maximize our revenue while exercising tight cost control to generate the highest possible return to our shareholders 
revenue is maximized by attracting qualified prospects to our properties  cost effectively converting these prospects into new residents and keeping our residents satisfied so they will renew 
table of contents their leases upon expiration 
while we believe that it is our high quality  well located assets that bring our customers to us  it is the customer service and superior value provided by our on site personnel that keeps them renting with us and recommending us to their friends 
we use technology to engage our customers in the way that they want to be engaged 
many of our residents utilize our web based resident portal which allows them to sign their lease  review their account and make payments  provide feedback and make service requests on line 
we seek to maximize capital appreciation of our properties by investing in markets that are characterized by conditions favorable to multifamily property appreciation 
these markets generally feature one or more of the following high barriers to entry where  because of land scarcity or government regulation  it is difficult or costly to build new apartment properties  creating limits on new supply  high single family home prices making our apartments a more economical housing choice  strong economic growth leading to household formation and job growth  which in turn leads to high demand for our apartments  and an attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention that allows us to increase rents 
acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital  which may include retained cash flow  issuance of additional equity and debt  sales of properties and joint venture agreements 
in addition  the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership op units as consideration for the acquired properties 
such transactions may  in certain circumstances  enable the sellers to defer  in whole or in part  the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales 
the company may acquire land parcels to hold and or sell based on market opportunities 
the company may also seek to acquire properties by purchasing defaulted or distressed debt that encumbers desirable properties in the hope of obtaining title to property through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure proceedings 
the company has also  in the past  converted some of its properties and sold them as condominiums but is not currently active in this line of business 
over the past several years  the company has done an extensive repositioning of its portfolio from low barrier to entry non core markets to high barrier to entry core markets 
since  the company has sold over  apartment units primarily in its non core markets for an aggregate sales price of approximately billion  acquired over  apartment units in its core markets for approximately billion and began approximately billion of development projects in its core markets 
we are currently seeking to acquire and develop assets primarily in the following targeted metropolitan areas boston  new york  washington dc  south florida  southern california  san francisco and seattle 
we also have investments in the aggregate about of our noi at december  in other markets including denver  atlanta  phoenix  new england excluding boston  orlando and jacksonville but do not currently intend to acquire or develop new assets in these markets 
as part of its strategy  the company purchases completed and fully occupied apartment properties  partially completed or partially occupied properties or land on which apartment properties can be constructed 
we intend to hold a diversified portfolio of assets across our target markets 
as of december   no single metropolitan area accounted for more than of our noi  though no guarantee can be made that noi concentration may not increase in the future 
we endeavor to attract and retain the best employees by providing them with the education  resources and opportunities to succeed 
we provide many classroom and on line training courses to assist our employees in interacting with prospects and residents as well as extensively train our customer service specialists in maintaining the equipment and appliances on our property sites 
we actively promote from within and many senior corporate and property leaders have risen from entry level or junior positions 
we monitor our employees engagement by surveying them annually and have consistently received high engagement scores 
we have a commitment to sustainability and consider the environmental impacts of our business activities 
we have a dedicated in house team that initiates and applies sustainable practices in all aspects of our business  including transactions  property operations and property management activities 
with its high density  multifamily housing is  by its nature  an environmentally friendly property type 
our recent acquisition and development activities have been primarily concentrated in pedestrian friendly urban locations near public transportation 
when developing and renovating our properties  we strive to reduce energy and water usage by investing in energy saving technology while positively impacting the experience of our residents and the value of our assets 
we continue to implement a combination of irrigation  lighting and hvac improvements at our properties that will reduce energy and water consumption 

table of contents current environment we expect strong growth in same store revenue anticipated increase ranging from to and noi anticipated increase ranging from to and are optimistic that the strength in fundamentals realized in will be sustained for the foreseeable future 
we believe the key drivers behind the anticipated increases in revenue are base rent pricing  renewal pricing  resident turnover and physical occupancy 
despite extremely slow growth in the overall economy  our business continues to perform well as evidenced by rising base and renewal rents 
our relatively stable turnover and solid occupancy  which we anticipate will continue throughout  provide us with the ability to increase rental rates 
the combined forces of demographics  household formations and the continued aversion to home ownership should ensure a continued strong demand for rental housing 
the company anticipates that same store expenses will increase to primarily due to increases in real estate taxes  utilities and payroll 
real estate taxes are expected to increase to in most significantly due to the burn off of a tax abatements in new york city but also due to expected value and rate increases in some of our jurisdictions 
utilities are expected to grow to in as increases in water  sewer and trash are partially offset by decreases in natural gas rates 
on site payroll is expected to increase by approximately in as normal annual merit increases in payroll should be mitigated by improvements in technology and automation 
this follows several years of excellent expense control  with a compounded annual growth in same store expenses of approximately over the last five years 
the company continues to sell non core assets and reduce its exposure to non core markets as we believe these assets do not fit into our long term plans and we can sell them for prices that we believe are favorable 
the company sold consolidated properties consisting of  apartment units for billion during the year ended december  the company s decision to accelerate the timing and increase the volume of dispositions combined with reinvestment of the cash proceeds in assets with lower cap rates see definition below later in was dilutive to our per share results 
the company defines dilution from transactions as the lost noi from sales proceeds that were not reinvested in other apartment properties or were reinvested in properties with a lower cap rate 
the company anticipates consolidated dispositions of approximately billion during the year ended december  competition for the properties we are interested in acquiring is significant due to the overall improvement in market fundamentals 
we believe our access to capital  our ability to execute large  complex transactions and our ability to efficiently stabilize large scale lease up properties provide us with a competitive advantage 
the company acquired consolidated properties consisting of  apartment units for billion and one commercial building for potential redevelopment for million 
the company anticipates consolidated acquisitions of approximately billion during the year ended december  the company also acquired six land parcels and entered into a long term ground lease on another land parcel for million during the year ended december  we acquired these land parcels with the intent to develop them into approximately million of new apartment properties 
the company also started construction on six projects representing  apartment units totaling million during the year ended december  the company expects to start construction on eight projects representing  apartment units totaling approximately million of development costs during the year ended december  on december   the company entered into a contract with affiliates of bank of america and barclays plc to acquire  for billion  half of their interests an approximately interest overall in archstone  a privately held owner  operator and developer of multifamily apartment properties 
on january   lehman brothers  the other owner of archstone  acquired this interest pursuant to a right of first offer and as a result  the company s contract with the sellers was terminated 
the company now has the exclusive right  exercisable on or before april   to contract to purchase the remaining interest in archstone owned by the same sellers for a price  determined by the company  equal to billion or higher 
any purchase of the remaining interest by the company would also be subject to lehman s right of first offer  and if lehman were to exercise such right  the company would be entitled to a break up fee of million  subject to repayment in certain limited circumstances 
in  the company incurred archstone related expenses of approximately million 
approximately million of this total was financing related and million was pursuit costs 
we currently have access to multiple sources of capital including the equity markets as well as both the secured and unsecured debt markets 
in december  the company completed a billion unsecured ten year note offering with a coupon of and an all in effective interest rate of approximately 
we also raised million in equity under our atm common share offering program in and raised an additional million under this program thus far in in july  the company replaced its then existing unsecured revolving credit facility which was due to mature in february with a new billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on july   subject to a one year extension option exercisable by the company 
the company believes that the new facility contains a diversified and strong bank group which increases its 
table of contents balance sheet flexibility going forward 
subsequent to the year ended december   the company amended this facility to increase available borrowings by million to billion and entered into a commitment for a new senior unsecured million delayed draw term loan facility 
the company arranged these facilities to replace a commitment for a billion senior unsecured bridge loan facility and represents access to certain but contingent capital should the company be successful in its pursuit of archstone 
these facilities are also available for other funding obligations should the company be unsuccessful in its pursuit of archstone 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  securities readily convertible to cash  current availability on our revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan facility and disposition proceeds for will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions  including an interest in archstone  debt maturities and existing development projects through we expect that our remaining longer term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings  equity issuances including eqr s atm common share offering program  property dispositions  joint ventures and cash generated from operations 
there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of fannie mae and freddie mac the government sponsored enterprises or gses 
through their lender originator networks  fannie mae and freddie mac are significant lenders both to the company and to buyers of the company s properties 
the gses have a mandate to support multifamily housing through their financing activities 
any changes to their mandates  reductions in their size or the scale of their activities or loss of key personnel could have a significant impact on the company and may  among other things  lead to lower values for our disposition assets and higher interest rates on our borrowings 
such changes may also provide an advantage to us by making the cost of financing single family home ownership more expensive and provide us a competitive advantage given the size of our balance sheet and the multiple sources of capital to which we have access 
we believe that the company is well positioned as of december  because our properties are geographically diverse  were approximately occupied on a same store basis and the long term demographic picture is positive 
with the exception of the washington  dc market area  little new multifamily rental supply will be added to our markets over the next several years 
we believe our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity will allow us to fund our debt maturities and development costs in the near term  and should also allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future 
as economic conditions continue to improve  the short term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed  along with the customer service and superior value provided by our on site personnel  should allow us to realize even more revenue growth and improvement in our operating results

under normal operating conditions  the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 
however  there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions  which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions and or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference 
should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature  the company s financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels 
during the fourth quarter of  the company announced a new dividend policy which it believes will generate payouts more closely aligned with the actual annual operating results of the company s core business and provide transparency to investors 
the company intends to pay an annual cash dividend equal to approximately of normalized ffo for the year 
during the year ended december   the company paid per share for each of the first three quarters and per share for the fourth quarter to bring the total payment for the year an annual rate of per share to approximately of normalized ffo 
the company anticipates the expected dividend payout will range from to per share per share for each of the first three quarters with the balance for the fourth quarter for the year ending december  all future dividends remain subject to the discretion of the board of trustees 
the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking 
while our dividend policy makes it less likely we will over distribute  it will also lead to a dividend reduction more quickly than a fixed dividend policy should operating results deteriorate 
the company believes that its expected operating cash flow will be sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions 
the company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities  including additional op units  and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures 
in addition  the company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high

improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 

table of contents derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company seeks to manage these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december  other total distributions paid in january amounted to million excluding distributions on partially owned properties  which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company admitted an institutional partner to two separate entities transactions one in december and the other in august  each owning a developable land parcel  in exchange for million in cash and retained a equity interest in both of these entities 
these land parcels are now unconsolidated 
total project costs are approximately million and construction will be predominantly funded with two separate long term  non recourse secured loans from the partner 
while the company is the managing member of both of the joint ventures  is responsible for constructing both of the projects and has given certain construction cost overrun guarantees  all major decisions are made jointly  the large majority of funding is provided by the partner and the partner has significant involvement in and oversight of the ongoing projects 
the company s remaining funding obligations are currently estimated at million 
the company s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its financial risk related to the development of the properties 
however  management does not believe that these investments have a materially different impact upon the company s liquidity  cash flows  capital resources  credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities 
in december  the company acquired a vacant land parcel at park avenue south in new york city in a joint venture with toll brothers nyse tol 
until the core and shell of the building is complete  the building and land will be owned jointly and are required to be consolidated on the company s balance sheet 
thereafter  the company will solely own and control the rental portion of the building floors and toll brothers will solely own and control the for sale portion of the building floors 
once the core and shell are complete  the toll brothers portion of the property will be deconsolidated from the company s balance sheet 
the acquisition was financed through contributions by the company and toll brothers of approximately million and million  respectively  which included a land purchase price of million and million  respectively  and taxes and fees of million and million  respectively 
deposits were made to the venture of million and million  respectively  to collateralize construction guarantees 
management does not believe that this investment has a materially different impact upon the company s liquidity  cash flows  capital resources  credit or market risk than its other consolidated development activities 
as of december   the company has six consolidated projects totaling  apartment units and two unconsolidated projects totaling apartment units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through march   as well as other completed development projects that are in various stages of lease up or are stabilized 
the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note of the company s consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  and are consistent with the year ended december  the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the five critical accounting policies are acquisition of investment properties the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  the company utilizes a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property  our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 
the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate  for indicators of impairment 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal and environmental concerns  as well as the company s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life  building improvements over a year to year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year to year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 

table of contents cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for a discussion of the company s policy with respect to capitalization vs 
expensing of fixed asset repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the company capitalizes an allocation of the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 
for all development projects  the company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend their time on development activities  with capitalization ceasing no later than days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property 
the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties  except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the valuation of financial instruments requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of apartment units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 
normalized funds from operations normalized ffo begins with ffo and excludes the impact of any expenses relating to non operating asset impairment and valuation allowances  property acquisition and other transaction costs related to mergers and acquisitions and pursuit cost write offs other expenses  gains and losses from early debt extinguishment  including prepayment penalties  preferred share preference unit redemptions and the cost related to the implied option value of non cash convertible debt discounts  gains and losses on the sales of non operating assets  including gains and losses from land parcel and condominium sales  net of the effect of income tax benefits or expenses  and other miscellaneous non comparable items 
the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and units units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company  because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo and ffo available 
table of contents to common shares and units units can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the company also believes that normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company because they allow investors to compare the company s operating performance to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company s actual operating results 
ffo  ffo available to common shares and units units  normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units do not represent net income  net income available to common shares units or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo  ffo available to common shares and units units  normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income  net income available to common shares units or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo  ffo available to common shares and units units  normalized ffo and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 
ffo available to common shares and units units and normalized ffo available to common shares and units units are calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares preference units in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the noncontrolling interests operating partnership 
subject to certain restrictions  the noncontrolling interests operating partnership may exchange their op units for common shares on a one for one basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s financial instruments result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates and changes in the securities industry and financial markets association sifma index for tax exempt debt 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term loan facilities as well as floating rate tax exempt debt 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
to the extent the company carries substantial cash balances  this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to manage market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa as well as to partially lock in rates on future debt issuances 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes

these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
