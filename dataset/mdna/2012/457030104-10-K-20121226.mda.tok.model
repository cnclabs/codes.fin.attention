item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s capital expenditures 
competition the supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins 
the degree of competition the company s stores encounter varies by location  primarily based on the size of the community in which the store is located and its proximity to other communities 
the company s principal competitors are  in alphabetical order  aldi  inc  bi lo  llc  food city k va t food stores  inc  food lion delhaize america  inc  the kroger co  publix super markets  inc  target corporation  and wal mart stores  inc 
increasingly over the last few years  competition for consumers food dollars has intensified due to the addition of  or increase in  food sections by many types of retailers such as specialty grocers  drug and convenience stores  national general merchandisers and discount retailers  membership clubs  warehouse stores and super centers 
restaurants are another significant competitor for food dollars 
supermarket chains generally compete on the basis of location  quality of products  service  price  convenience  product variety and store condition 
the company believes its competitive advantages include convenient locations  the quality of service it provides its customers  competitive pricing  product variety and quality and a pleasant shopping environment  which is enhanced by its ongoing modernization program 

table of contents by concentrating its operations within a relatively small geographic region  the company is also positioned to more carefully monitor its markets  and the needs of its customers within those markets 
the company s senior executives live and work in the company s operating region  thereby allowing management to quickly identify changes in needs and customer preference 
because of the company s size  store managers have direct access to corporate management and are able to receive quick decisions regarding requested changes in operations 
the company can then move quickly to make adjustments in its business in response to changes in the market and customer needs 
the company s large national and international competitors primary advantages are related to their size 
these larger organizations may have an advantage through stronger buying power and more significant capital resources 
the company s management monitors competitive activity and regularly reviews and periodically adjusts the company s marketing and business strategies as management deems appropriate in light of existing conditions in the company s region 
the company s ability to remain competitive in its changing markets will depend in part on its ability to pursue its expansion and renovation programs and its response to remodeling and new store openings by its competitors 
seasonality sales in the grocery segment of the company s business are subject to a slight seasonal variance due to holiday related sales and due to sales in areas where seasonal homes are located 
sales are traditionally higher in the company s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to thanksgiving and christmas

ingles also operates two other lines of business  fluid dairy processing and shopping center rentals 
the fluid dairy processing segment sells approximately of its products to the retail grocery segment and approximately of its products to third parties 
real estate ownership including the shopping center rental segment is an important component of the company s operations  providing both operational and economic benefit 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of ingles financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates are based on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management estimates  by their nature  involve judgments regarding future uncertainties  and actual results may therefore differ materially from these estimates 
self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation  general liability  and group medical and dental benefits 
risks and uncertainties are associated with self insurance  however  the company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverage of  per occurrence for workers compensation   for general liability  and  per covered person for medical care benefits for a policy year 
self insurance liabilities are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators and analyses performed by actuaries engaged by the company 
these estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future 
the majority of the company s properties are self insured for casualty losses and business interruption  however  liability coverage is maintained 
the company s self insurance reserves totaled million and million for employee group insurance  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance at september  and september   respectively 
in fiscal  the company refined its methods for calculating self insurance liabilities which resulted in a significant increase to the previously reported estimate 
the company believes the amounts accrued under the revised method are adequate  however  future accruals may fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future 
asset impairments the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic asset groups are primarily comprised of our individual store and shopping center properties 
for assets to be held and used  the company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets held for sale  impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value 
the recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal associates  net of costs to sell 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the company s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future 
these estimates can fluctuate significantly due to 
table of contents changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether any indicators of impairment have occurred 
closed store accrual for closed properties under long term lease agreements  a liability is recognized and expensed based on the difference between the present value of any remaining liability under the lease and the present value of the estimated market rate at which the company expects to be able to sublease the properties  in accordance with fasb asc topic the company s estimates of market rates are based on its experience  knowledge and third party advice or market data 
if the real estate and leasing markets change  sublease recovery could vary significantly from the recoveries originally assumed  resulting in a material change in the company s recorded liability 
the closed store accrual is included in the line item accrued expenses and current portion of other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
vendor allowances the company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from the many vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these incentives and allowances are primarily comprised of volume or purchase based incentives  advertising allowances  slotting fees  and promotional discounts 
the purpose of these incentives and allowances is generally to help defray the costs incurred by the company for stocking  advertising  promoting and selling the vendor s products 
these allowances generally relate to short term arrangements with vendors  often relating to a period of a month or less  and are negotiated on a purchase by purchase or transaction by transaction basis 
whenever possible  vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
in those instances  the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs using a rational and systematic methodology  which results in the recognition of these incentives when the inventory related to the vendor consideration received is sold 
vendor allowances applied as a reduction of merchandise costs totaled million  million and million for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
vendor advertising allowances that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs of advertising the vendor s specific products are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
vendor advertising allowances recorded as a reduction of advertising expense totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of the company s product advertising  which could increase or decrease the company s expenditures 
similarly  the company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenue  as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the company s stores 
uncertain tax positions despite the company s belief that its tax positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  the company believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
the company s positions are evaluated in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of its tax audits as well as evolving case law 
income tax expense includes the impact of provisions for and changes to uncertain tax positions as the company considers appropriate 
unfavorable settlement of any particular position would require use of cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense at the time of resolution
