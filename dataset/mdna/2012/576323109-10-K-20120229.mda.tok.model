table of contents suppliers  materials and working capital under many of our contracts  our customers provide the necessary materials and supplies for projects and we are responsible for the installation of  but not the cost or warranty of those materials 
under certain of our other projects  we purchase the necessary materials and supplies on behalf of our customers from third party providers 
we are not dependent on any one supplier for materials or supplies and have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of materials and supplies 
we utilize independent contractors to assist on projects and to help us manage work flow 
our independent contractors are typically sole proprietorships or small business entities that provide their own vehicles  tools and insurance coverage 
we are not dependent on any single independent contractor 
we need working capital to support seasonal variations in our business  primarily due to the impact of weather conditions on external construction and maintenance work and the spending patterns of our customers  both of which influence the timing of associated spending to support related customer demand 
our business is typically slower in the first quarter of each calendar year 
accordingly  we generally experience seasonal working capital needs from approximately april through december to support growth in unbilled revenue and accounts receivable  and to a lesser extent  inventory 
timing of project close outs can also contribute to fluctuations in unbilled revenue  which can impact our working capital needs 
our billing terms are generally net days  although some contracts allow our customers to retain a portion from to of the contract amount until the job is completed 
for certain customers  we maintain inventory to meet the material requirements of the contracts 
occasionally  certain of our customers pay us in advance for a portion of the materials we purchase for their projects  or allow us to pre bill them for materials purchases up to a specified amount 
vendor terms are generally days 
our agreements with subcontractors often contain a pay when paid provision  whereby our payments to subcontractors are made only after we are paid by our customers 
competition our industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented 
we often compete with a number of companies in the markets in which we operate  ranging from small local independent companies to large national firms 
the national or large regional firms that compete with us include quanta services  inc  myr group  inc  dycom industries  inc  pike electric  inc  bechtel corporation  ma mortenson company and ma blattner sons  inc relatively few significant barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor 
some of our customers employ personnel to perform infrastructure services of the type we provide 
we compete based upon our industry experience  technical expertise  financial and operational resources  north american presence  industry reputation and customer service 
while we believe our customers consider a number of factors when selecting a service provider  most of their work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often a principal factor in determining which service provider is selected 
see item a 
risk factors our industry is highly competitive  which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
regulation and environmental matters we are subject to state and federal laws that apply to businesses generally  including laws and regulations related to labor relations  worker safety and environmental protection 
while many of our customers operate in regulated industries for example  utilities regulated by the public service commission or communications companies regulated by the federal communications commission  we are not generally subject to such regulation and oversight 
as a contractor  our operations are subject to various laws  including regulations related to vehicle registrations  including those of state and the united states department of transportation  regulations related to worker safety and health  including those established by the occupational safety and health administration  contractor licensing requirements  permitting and inspection requirements  and building and electrical codes 
we are also subject to numerous environmental laws governing our operations  including the handling  transportation and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes  as well as emissions and discharges into the environment  including discharges into air  surface water and groundwater and soil 
we also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment 
under certain of these laws and regulations  liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of properties  regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal 
the presence of contamination from such substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our business 
in addition  we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations 
for example  some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 

table of contents we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
we sometimes perform directional drilling operations in certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we believe we have all licenses and permits needed to conduct operations and that we are in compliance with all material applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if we fail to comply with any material applicable regulatory requirements  we could incur significant liabilities 
we offer services and are branded under the mastec service mark and other service marks 
financial information about geographic areas in april  we expanded our foreign operations through the acquisition of fabcor target co ltd  a canadian natural gas and petroleum pipeline infrastructure construction company 
we also have foreign operations in parts of latin america and the caribbean 
for the three years in the period ended december   revenues of million  million and million  respectively  were derived from foreign operations 
in addition  we held property and equipment in foreign countries of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our business  financial condition and results of operations in foreign countries may be adversely affected by monetary and fiscal policies  currency fluctuations  energy shortages  regulatory requirements and other political  social and economic developments or instability 
refer to item a risk factors for additional information 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees  approximately of whom were represented by a union or were subject to collective bargaining agreements 
these collective bargaining agreements require us to pay specified wages and provide certain benefits to these employees  including contributions to multi employer pension plans and employee benefit trusts 
the collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms that are similar to the ones contained in the expiring agreements 
see item a  risk factors certain of our businesses have employees who are represented by a union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements  the unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our operations 
we hire employees from a number of sources  including our industry  trade schools and colleges 
our primary sources for employees include promotion from within  team member referrals  print and internet advertising and direct recruiting 
we attract and retain employees by offering technical training opportunities  bonus opportunities  stock ownership  competitive salaries and a comprehensive benefits package 
we believe that our focus on training and career development helps us to attract and retain employees 
our employees participate in ongoing educational programs  many of which are internally developed  to enhance their technical and management skills through classroom and field training 
we provide opportunities for promotion and mobility within our organization  which we also believe helps us to retain our employees 
we believe our relations with our employees are good

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our industry and our customers industries economic downturns could reduce capital expenditures in the industries we serve  which may result in a decrease in demand for our services 
the demand for our services has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the us economy 
given the continuing economic downturn  our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure  or may have difficulty obtaining financing for planned projects 
this has  and may continue to result in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date  such as those experienced in connection with certain of our renewable energy and wireless projects during such cancellations or deferrals could result in decreased demand for our services and could materially adversely affect the results of our operations  cash flows and liquidity 
in addition  our customers are affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services 
slow downs in real estate  fluctuations in commodity prices and decreased demand by end customers for services could affect our customers and their capital expenditure plans 
because we have previously been negatively impacted by economic downturns  we continually monitor our customers industries and their relative health compared to the economy as a whole 
reductions in new housing starts  for example  have negatively affected our customers who utilize our services to construct their last mile of communications infrastructure  as well as other industries we serve  including electric utility transmission and grid connection  as well as water and sewer and natural gas pipeline construction 
additionally  our customers who provide satellite and broadband communications to consumers across the country could be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are not ordered at the rate that our customers anticipate 
during an economic downturn  like the current economic downturn  our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure or may determine to outsource less work 
a decrease in any of these projects  new subscriptions and upgrades or any other services we provide could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our industry is highly competitive  which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
our industry is highly fragmented  and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate  ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicing regional and national markets 
we also face competition from existing or prospective customers that employ in house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide 
there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain of the markets in which we operate and  as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors 
most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process 
consequently  price is often the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected  especially on smaller  less complex projects 
smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements 
if we are unsuccessful in bidding on these projects  or if our ability to win such projects requires that we accept lesser margins  then our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change  and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demand for our services 
we derive  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the communications and utilities industries 
the communications and utilities industries are subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation 
changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide 
for example  new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for the transmission of voice  video and data  and improvements in existing technology may allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
technological advances may also result in lower costs for sources of energy  which may render existing wind energy  solar energy and natural gas projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete 
additionally  the communications and utilities industries have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers 
our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries we serve or the consolidation of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
risks related to our business we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers  and the loss of one of these customers or a reduction in their demand for our services could impair our financial performance 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t and el paso corporation  respectively 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately  and of our revenue from directv  at t and el paso corporation  respectively  and for the year ended december   we derived approximately   and of our revenue from directv  at t  enbridge and verizon  respectively 
in addition  our ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and of our revenue in each of the three years ended december   and  respectively 
because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers  and certain of our services are provided on a non recurring  project by project basis  we could experience a reduction in our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity if the amount of business we obtain from these customers is reduced  or if we complete the required work on our projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 
just over of our revenues were derived from non recurring project specific work for the year ended december   which may further increase this risk if we are not able to replace completed project work with new work 
in addition  many of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or no advance notice 
any of these factors could negatively impact our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
additionally  pursuant to our february amended and restated purchase option agreement with red ventures llc red ventures  red ventures has an option to purchase directstar and its subsidiaries which  in support of the directv installation business  provides marketing and sales services on behalf of directv from mastec at any time from march  to november   for an amount equal to the sum of i the shareholders equity of directstar as of may   ii five percent of adjusted net income generally  the net income loss before provision for income taxes of directstar from january  until the last day of the month immediately prior to the date of the sale and iii  should red ventures exercise its purchase option  our revenues and profits from directv would be reduced 
directstar accounted for million and million of our revenues in and  respectively 
based upon current discussions with red ventures  we currently anticipate that the sale of directstar will occur in the second quarter of  however  we cannot provide any assurance that red ventures will exercise its option or that any sale will occur 
most of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
more than half of our revenue is derived from multi year master service agreements and other service agreements 
under our multi year master service agreements and other service agreements  we contract to provide customers with individual project services  through work orders  within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis 
under these agreements  our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us 
a significant decline in the projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
most of our contracts may be canceled on short or no advance notice  so our revenue is not guaranteed 
additionally  certain of our contracts with customers are subject to their ability to secure financing or other conditions and therefore may not result in revenues or profits 
most of our contracts are cancelable on short or no advance notice  ranging from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon days notice  even if we are not in default under the contract 
many of our contracts  including our service agreements  are periodically open to public bid 
we may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that are re bid 
we also provide a significant portion of our services on a non recurring  project by project basis 
we could experience a reduction in our revenue  profitability and liquidity if our customers cancel a significant number of contracts  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  or we complete the required work under a significant number of our non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects 

table of contents additionally  from time to time  we may announce the award of certain contracts 
these contracts may contain financing or other conditions and therefore may not result in revenues or profits if our customers are unable to obtain the associated financing or any other conditions associated with such projects are otherwise not met 
amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits 
our backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and therefore is an uncertain indicator of future operating results 
a significant portion of our month backlog at december  was composed of master service agreements and other service agreements  none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short or no advance notice 
the balance of our backlog is our estimate of work to be completed on long term installation construction fixed price agreements 
these backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period  or at all 
in addition  contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable 
we may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions  other project deferrals or delays  scope adjustments  external market factors and economic factors beyond our control 
if our backlog fails to materialize  our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity would be materially and adversely affected 
accordingly  our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings 
our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers  exposing us to variable quarterly results 
some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towards the end of the year 
adverse weather conditions  particularly during the winter season  also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of north america 
as a result  we experience reduced revenue in the first quarter of each calendar year 
natural catastrophes such as hurricanes or other severe weather could also have  and have had  a negative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions  which could result in a decline in results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
for example  the northeastern united states was negatively affected by flooding in the second half of heavy rains began in the summer  followed by additional rainfall from hurricane irene in august and tropical storm lee in september  causing flooding conditions  which hurt productivity and profitability on certain of our pipeline projects in the marcellus shale basin 
we may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed price contracts  which could impair our financial performance 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and other service agreements that are fixed price contracts 
under these contracts  we set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may be greater than we anticipated 
in addition to master or other service agreements  we enter into contracts that require installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system 
under those agreements  we have also contractually agreed to a price per unit 
profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any expected losses on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such units 
our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services 
these costs may be affected by a variety of factors  such as lower than anticipated productivity  conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual project revenue and gross profit to differ from original estimates  and as a result  certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated  or losses  if actual costs exceed our estimates  which could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
we recognize revenue for our installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  therefore  variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability 
we recognize revenue on long term installation construction fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs 
the percentage of completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs 
contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material 
we immediately recognize the full amount of an estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability  which could negatively impact our liquidity 

table of contents our failure to properly manage projects  or project delays  may result in additional costs or claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
certain of our engagements involve large scale  complex projects 
the quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources  including third party contractors and our own personnel 
our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees  or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones 
additionally  delays on a particular project  including permitting delays  may cause us to incur costs for standby pay  and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date 
in addition  some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines  therefore  any failure to properly estimate or manage cost  or delay in the completion of projects could subject us to penalties which could further adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
further  any defects or errors  or failures to meet our customers expectations could result in large damage claims against us  and because of the substantial cost of  and potentially long lead times necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our complex projects  in particular on our pipeline and renewable energy projects  damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services 
we may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings  and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility 
some of our contracts require performance and payment bonds 
if our business continues to grow  our bonding requirements may increase 
if we are not able to renew or obtain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future  we may be precluded from being able to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with certain customers 
in addition  even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds  we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds  which would reduce availability under our credit facility 
increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability  liquidity and availability under our credit facility 
because of factors such as increases in claims  projected significant increases in medical costs and wages  lost compensation and reductions in coverage  insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations 
an increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availability under our revolving credit facility 
we are self insured against many potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation and employee group health claims  those policies are subject to high deductibles  and we are self insured up to the amount of the deductible 
since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies  we are effectively self insured for substantially all claims 
we actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  and reflect the present value of those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non current liabilities 
the determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated quarterly 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors  the effects of which are often unknown  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
if our insurance claims increase or if costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities  we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity 
warranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we generally warrant the work we perform for a one to two year period following substantial completion of a project  subject to further extensions of the warranty period following repairs or replacements 
we have not historically accrued reserves for potential warranty claims as they have been immaterial 
the costs associated with such warranties  including any warranty related legal proceedings  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
demand for pipeline construction services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil  natural gas and other fuel prices and the cost of energy infrastructure projects 
demand for our pipeline construction services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration  development  and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and natural gas companies 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
low prices for oil and natural gas generally depress levels of exploration  development and production activity  resulting in a corresponding decline in the demand for pipeline construction services 
factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include the levels of supply and demand for oil and natural gas  especially demand for natural gas in the united states  
table of contents governmental regulations  including policies regarding the exploration  production and development of oil and natural gas reserves as well as environmental laws and initiatives to control global warming  global weather conditions and natural disasters  worldwide political  military  and economic conditions  the level of oil production by non opec countries and available excess production capacity within opec  oil refining capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas  the cost of producing and delivering oil and gas  and potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile 
spending on exploration and production activities by large oil and gas companies has a significant impact on the activity levels of pipeline construction services 
in addition  demand for pipeline construction services may be affected by the costs of energy exploration and constructing energy infrastructure projects 
for example  while high oil and gas prices may increase oil and gas exploration  production and transportation activity  high demand for equipment  materials and labor required for such projects may increase the costs of such projects and dampen demand for our services 
furthermore  increased costs for raw materials such as steel and other commodities may make some projects uneconomical despite robust oil and gas prices  thus reducing demand for our pipeline construction services 
a decrease in demand for our pipeline construction services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
legislative actions and incentives relating to electric power and renewable energy may fail to result in increased demand for our services 
while we believe the energy policy act of the energy act will provide opportunities in the industries we serve  implementation of the energy act is still subject to considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty 
regulations implementing the components of the energy act that may affect demand for our services remain  in some cases  subject to review in various federal courts 
in one such case  decided in february  a federal court of appeals vacated ferc s interpretation of the scope of its backstop siting authority 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  is uncertain 
as a result  the energy act may not result in increased spending on electric power transmission infrastructure 
continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the energy act may result in slower than anticipated growth in demand for our services 
changes to renewable portfolio standards could  and decreased demand for renewable energy projects would  negatively impact our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
a portion of our business provides construction and or installation services to owners and operators of wind power  solar power and other renewable energy facilities 
the development of wind  solar and other renewable energy facilities is highly dependent upon federal production tax credits associated with the arra and the existence of renewable portfolio standards and other state incentives 
renewable portfolio standards are state specific statutory provisions requiring that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of operational development capacity to renewable energy sources 
additionally  certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every unit of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to supply companies 
these standards have spurred growth in the wind and renewable energy industry and a corresponding increase in demand for renewable energy infrastructure construction services 
currently  states as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico have adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals 
elimination of  or changes to  existing renewable portfolio standards or similar environmental policies may negatively affect demand for our services 
additionally  renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup 
the locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable unless connectivity to the grid to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible 
furthermore  funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available 
these factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated or a delay in the timing of construction of these projects and the related infrastructure  which would negatively affect demand for our services 
the impact of the american recovery and reinvestment act of is uncertain 
the continuing economic downturn  coupled with a lack of available capital  resulted in a tremendous amount of uncertainty  with numerous renewable energy projects being delayed or canceled 
while we believe that the arra  which was enacted into law in february  should aid renewable energy  electrical transmission and rural broadband market opportunities  the extent to which it will result in future revenues is uncertain 
we cannot predict when programs under the arra will be implemented  or the timing and scope of 
table of contents investments to be made under these programs 
investments for renewable energy  electric power infrastructure rural broadband facilities under arra programs may not occur  may be less than anticipated or may be delayed  which would negatively impact demand for our services 
additionally  the tax incentives provided by the arra have a finite duration 
currently  the election to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit is only available for qualified wind facilities placed in service from to december   the us treasury grant program will only be applicable to wind and solar projects placed in service in or or after as long as construction begins in or and is completed before the termination date of the credit otherwise available for the property  and the production tax credit is scheduled to expire on december  and will not be available for energy generated from wind facilities placed in service after that date unless the credit program is extended or renewed 
whether the investment tax credit or us treasury grant program will be effective for wind  solar or other renewable energy projects is uncertain  as are any future efforts to extend or renew the production tax credit  the investment tax credit  and or the us treasury grant program 
furthermore  the provisions regarding any extension or renewal may not be as favorable as those that currently exist 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any extension or renewal of the production tax credit  the investment tax credit  and or the us treasury grant program would be enacted prior to its expiration or  if allowed to expire  that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect 
we also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated and bonus depreciation with respect to wind or solar energy generation assets will not be modified  amended or repealed in the future 
if the investment tax credit or the us treasury grant program are not effective or if the federal production tax credit is not extended or renewed  or is extended or renewed at a lower rate  the ability of our customers to obtain financing for these projects may be impaired or eliminated 
in addition  changes to  or ineffectiveness of  the arra incentives could cause wind and solar farms to be less profitable  thereby potentially reducing demand for our wind and solar farm infrastructure construction services 
our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if demand for our services or the tax incentives were reduced 
many of our customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and the profitability of those services 
many of our communications customers are regulated by the fcc  and our energy customers are regulated by ferc 
in addition  our utility customers are regulated by state public utility commissions 
these agencies may interpret the application of their regulations in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations 
if existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide  demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced 
our business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments  which could cause delays and result in additional costs 
we perform work under a variety of conditions  including  but not limited to  difficult and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions 
performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations  potentially causing us to incur additional  unanticipated costs  reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages 
in addition  some of our contracts require that we assume the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected 
some of our projects involve challenging engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  sometimes over several years 
we may encounter difficulties in engineering  delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party  equipment and material delivery delays  schedule changes  delays from customer failure to timely obtain rights of way  weather related delays  delays by subcontractors in completing their portion of the project and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  but which impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule 
in some cases  delays and additional costs may be substantial  and we may be required to cancel a project and or compensate the customer for the delay 
we may not be able to recover any of such costs 
any such delays or cancellations  defects or errors or other failures to meet customer expectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project 
delays or cancellations could also negatively impact our reputation or relationships with our customers  which could adversely affect our ability to secure new contracts 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
some of the work we perform is in underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants 
in such a case  we may be liable for fines and damages 
we own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
additionally  we sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials 
these releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
in addition  new environmental laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material negative impact on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition 
construction projects undertaken by us expose our employees to electrical lines  pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials  heavy equipment  mechanical failures  transportation accidents  adverse weather conditions and the risk of damage to equipment and property 
these hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims which could  in some cases  substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services 
in addition  if serious accidents or fatalities occur  or our safety records were to deteriorate  we may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining other new contracts and certain existing contracts could be terminated 
our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus 
see risk factors our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities  employee turnover  increase the costs of our projects  or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers  which could materially reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances  and our properties may have environmental contamination  which could result in material liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
certain of our current and historical construction operations have used hazardous materials and  to the extent that such materials are not properly stored  contained or recycled  they could become hazardous waste 
additionally  some of our contracts require that we assume the environmental risk of site conditions and require that we indemnify our customers for any damages  including environmental damages incurred in connection with our projects 
we may be subject to claims under various environmental laws and regulations federal and state statutes and or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages  as well as for natural resource damages and the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  groundwater  and other media under laws such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act 
such claims may arise  for example  out of current or former conditions at project sites  current or former properties owned or leased by us  and contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties 
liability may be imposed without regard to fault and may be strict  joint and several  such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination or other damages  or even for the entire share  and may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties causing the contamination 
our failure to comply with the regulations of the us occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
the occupational safety and health act of  as amended  or osha  establishes certain employer responsibilities  including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury  compliance with standards promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration and various recordkeeping  disclosure and procedural requirements 
various standards  including standards for notices of hazards and safety in excavation and demolition work may apply to our operations 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of business in complying with osha and other state and local laws and regulations  and could incur penalties and fines in the future  including in extreme cases  criminal sanctions 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk  and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what are believed to be appropriate precautions  we have suffered employee injuries and fatalities in the past and may suffer additional injuries or fatalities in the future 
serious accidents of this nature may subject us to substantial penalties  civil litigation or criminal prosecution 
personal injury claims for damages  including for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs and liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate  or if we suffered substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations  customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us  which could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
we have  from time to time  received notice from the us department of transportation that our motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges 
if we were not able to successfully resolve these issues  our ability to service our customers could be damaged  which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 

table of contents risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects  and we could be adversely affected by our failure to comply with the laws applicable to our foreign activities  including the us foreign corrupt practices act and other similar worldwide anti bribery laws 
we derived of our revenue from international markets for the year ended december   and we may further expand the volume of services we provide internationally 
our international operations are presently conducted primarily in canada  latin america and the caribbean  but we have performed work in various other foreign countries and revenues derived from  or the number of countries in which we operate  could expand over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets  may adversely affect our customers  their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations  foreign currency fluctuations  exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings  political  economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex us and foreign laws and treaties  including tax laws and the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa 
these risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers or to operate our international business profitably  and our overall business and results of operations could be negatively affected by our foreign activities 
the fcpa and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit us based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we pursue opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption to some degree  and  in certain circumstances  compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
further  we require our subcontractors  agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws 
although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we  our employees and our agents comply with the fcpa and other anti bribery laws  there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect us against liability under the fcpa or other laws for actions taken by our agents  employees and intermediaries 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence  or due to the acts or inadvertence of others  we could suffer from severe criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  business  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  detecting  investigating  and resolving actual or alleged fcpa violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management 
our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties  or we may be unable to maintain these relationships  either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we depend on subcontractors to complete certain work on some of our projects 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with subcontractors arising from  among other things  the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor  customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract 
in addition  if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies and or perform the agreed upon services  then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized 
in addition  the absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts 
any of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may choose  or be required  to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay  or delay paying us for the related services 
we use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow 
in some cases  we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services 
if we choose  or are required  to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail to pay  or delay paying us for the related work  we could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity 
increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins 
the price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control  including geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by the opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries  regional production patterns and environmental concerns 
most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing 
accordingly  any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity 
our profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers are unable to pay for our services 
in the past  we incurred significant losses after a number of customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn  in which certain industry factors worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers 
in  we recorded million of provisions for bad debts and as of december   our allowance for uncollectible accounts totaled million 
as of december   we had million of receivables from customers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization 
we do not anticipate difficulties in collecting the related receivables  however  we could experience losses if such customers are unable to pay us for our services 

table of contents our financial results are based  in part  upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of revenue recognition  provisions for contract losses  allowances for doubtful accounts  securities available for sale  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  acquisition related contingent consideration  certain convertible debt obligations  other reserves and accruals  impairment of assets  income taxes  accrued self insured claims and litigation and contingencies 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we may incur goodwill impairment charges which could harm our profitability 
when we acquire a business  we record goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including anticipated future liabilities and liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets of that business 
as a result of our acquisitions  we have million of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded as of december  we expect to continue to record additions to goodwill in future periods in connection with completed acquisitions  including goodwill resulting from future earn out payments for acquisitions completed prior to december  we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to determine whether such carrying values exceed their fair market values 
we may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with any of our acquisitions in the future if the markets they serve or their businesses deteriorate 
we may incur restructuring or impairment charges  which could reduce our profitability 
from time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability 
we could incur charges in the future as a result of eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy  reducing or eliminating services or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin  reducing costs of reporting units that need margin improvements  and reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources 
any charges related to restructuring or impairment would be reflected as operating expenses and could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity 
certain of our businesses have employees who are represented by a union or are subject to collective bargaining agreements  the unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our operations 
certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements 
although all of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future despite the terms of these agreements 
strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
additionally  as current agreements expire  the labor unions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members  or at all  or avoid strikes  lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members 
therefore  it cannot be assured that new agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire  or on terms that we find desirable 
any labor action against us relating to failure to reach an agreement with employee labor unions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations our participation in multi employer pension plans may subject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
substantially all of our union and collective bargaining agreements require us to participate with other companies in multi employer pension plans 
to the extent that those plans are underfunded defined benefit plans  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of erisa  may subject us to substantial liabilities if we withdraw from such multi employer plans or if they are terminated 
under current law regarding multi employer defined benefit plans  a plan s termination  an employer s voluntary partial or complete withdrawal from  or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from  an underfunded multi employer defined benefit plan requires participating employers to make payments to the plan for their proportionate share of the multi employer plan s unfunded vested liabilities 
furthermore  the pension protection act of added new funding rules 
table of contents generally applicable to plan years beginning after for multi employer plans that are classified as endangered  seriously endangered  or critical status 
if plans in which we participate are in critical status  benefit reductions may apply and or we could be required to make additional contributions which could materially adversely affect our liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
based upon the information available to us from plan administrators as of december   several of the multi employer pension plans in which we participate are underfunded 
the pension protection act requires that underfunded pension plans improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding 
in addition  if a multi employer defined benefit plan fails to satisfy certain minimum funding requirements  the internal revenue service may impose a nondeductible excise tax of on the amount of the accumulated funding deficiency for those employers contributing to the fund 
we have been notified that certain plans to which our subsidiaries contribute are in critical status and require additional contributions in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans 
as a result  we expect our required contributions to these plans to increase in the future 
the amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute in the future cannot be estimated  as such amounts will be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans  investment returns and the level of underfunding of such plans 
on november   we  along with other members of the pipe line contractors association plca  voluntarily withdrew from the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund central states  a defined benefit multi employer pension plan 
in connection with this withdrawal  we recorded a withdrawal liability of million within costs of revenue 
we withdrew from the central states plan in order to mitigate our liability in connection with the plan  which is in critical status 
the plan  however  has asserted that the plca members did not effect a withdrawal on november   although we believe that a legally effective withdrawal occurred as of this date and have recorded our withdrawal liability on this basis 
if the plan were to prevail in its assertion and our withdrawal was deemed to have occurred after this date  however  then the amount of our withdrawal liability would be expected to increase 
in addition  if this plan were to undergo a mass withdrawal  as defined by erisa and the pension benefit guaranty corporation  within a three year time frame from the beginning of the calendar year from the point of our withdrawal  we could have additional liability 
withdrawal liabilities  requirements to pay increased contributions  and or excise taxes in connection with any of the multi employer pension plans in which we participate could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 
see note other retirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees  we will be unable to operate efficiently  which could reduce our revenue  profitability and liquidity 
our business is labor intensive  and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover 
in addition  given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform  many of our employees are trained in and possess specialized technical skills 
at times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve  it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel 
we may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilled labor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy 
our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel 
we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite skills 
additionally  our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management 
labor shortages  increased labor or training costs  or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
our revolving credit facility  senior notes and senior convertible notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
at december   we had million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our senior notes due and our senior convertible notes due we also have a revolving credit facility with million outstanding as of december  availability under our credit facility as of december  was approximately million  net of outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating million 
the terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders 
the prohibited actions include  among other things buying back shares in excess of specified amounts  making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts  incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts  paying cash dividends  creating certain liens against our assets  
table of contents prepaying subordinated indebtedness  engaging in certain mergers or combinations  and engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control as defined in the credit facility and the indenture governing our senior notes 
additionally  certain provisions of our convertible notes could make it more expensive for a third party to acquire us or require us to repurchase the convertible notes for cash when required by the holders  including following a fundamental change as defined in the indenture 
our credit facility requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility  we would be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business 
a default could also result in the acceleration of our obligations under the credit facility  or under the indenture relating to the senior notes and the indenture relating to our convertible notes 
in addition  these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us  including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing  if needed 
our business is capital intensive and  to the extent we need additional financing  we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms  which may materially decrease our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
our inability to enforce non competition agreements with former principals and key management of the businesses we acquire may adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
in connection with our acquisitions  we generally require that key management and the former principals of the businesses we acquire enter into non competition agreements in our favor 
the laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of non competition agreements 
generally  state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a non competition agreement  consequently  we cannot predict with certainty whether  if challenged  a court will enforce any particular non competition agreement 
if one or more former principals or members of key management of the businesses we acquire leave and the courts refuse to enforce the non compete agreement entered into by such person or persons  we might be subject to increased competition  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our operating results  cash flows and liquidity 
we have made  and in the future may continue to make strategic acquisitions or investments 
however  we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment opportunities  or may be unable to obtain the consent of our lenders and therefore  may not be able to complete such acquisition or strategic investments 
we may pay for acquisitions or strategic investments with our common stock or with convertible securities  which may dilute your investment in our common stock  or we may decide to pursue acquisitions with which investors may not agree 
in connection with most of our acquisitions  we have also agreed to substantial earn out arrangements 
to the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn out arrangement  it will reduce our cash flows in subsequent periods 
in addition  acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including the ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business operations  financial reporting and accounting control systems into our business  increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions  or unforeseen internal difficulties  the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs  diversion of management s attention  and the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations 
in addition  acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed  or were unable  to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations 
we cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties we assume upon consummation of an acquisition 
we may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that materially adversely affect us  such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws 
any such liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with  or resulting from  acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
borrowings or issuances of convertible securities associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms 
claims  lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability  cash flows and liquidity 
we are subject to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  consequential damages  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  pursuant to our service agreements  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide 
claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs 
when appropriate  we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in light of current information  legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage  and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to case developments 
if our reserves are inadequate  or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable  or if there is an increase in liabilities for which we self insure  we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity 
an adverse determination on any such claim  lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  claims  lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business 
we have recorded unrealized losses to reduce the carrying value of certain auction rate securities we hold  and may incur additional impairment charges with respect to auction rate securities in future periods 
the continuing illiquidity of the auction rate securities market may affect our ability to liquidate certain auction rate securities that we classify as securities available for sale on our balance sheet 
our securities available for sale consist of auction rate securities  which represent interests in pools of student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program and a structured finance security 
the structured finance security has an attached credit default swap under which the principal value of the structured finance security would be partially or fully forfeited at net default rates on the underlying corporate debt obligations ranging from to 
the actual net default rate as of december  was estimated to be 
both the structured finance security and the credit default swap are collateralized by investment grade credit linked notes made up of floating rate international bank notes 
all of our securities available for sale as of december   with a par value of million and an estimated fair value and carrying amount of million  had insufficient bidders at the scheduled rollover dates  indicating that immediate liquidity at par was unavailable 
as of december   cumulative credit and other losses of million have been recognized in connection with our structured finance security 
cumulative unrealized losses associated with our student loan auction rate securities totaled million as of december  our valuation is sensitive to market conditions and management s judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the applicable securities  and for structured finance security  changes to the credit ratings of the underlying assets supporting the security as well as rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral values  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
we are uncertain as to when and if liquidity associated with these investments will improve  whether we will be able to exit these investments at their respective cost bases  or whether we will incur additional temporary or other than temporary losses as a result of these investments 
as a result of this uncertainty  our auction rate securities are classified as a long term assets as of december  we have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state department of transportation related projects and assets that were sold in february effective february   we sold our state department of transportation related projects and assets 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of our state department of transportation projects and assets to settle previously disclosed warranty  indemnification and other claims primarily relating to work we had performed on the state department of transportation projects we sold 
in connection with the settlement agreement  the parties also agreed to further amend and restate the amended asset purchase agreement effective as of january   which we refer to as the revised amended agreement 
in connection with the sale of our state department of transportation related projects and assets and the related settlement  we agreed to keep certain liabilities  mainly related to the cost to maintain and continue certain performance and payment bonds  certain obligations under leases between the parties and certain other litigation matters 
we may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result of any third party claims to the extent any third parties seek payment from us directly and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations contained in the revised amended agreement  including any losses resulting from creditor claims  in the event the buyer was financially unable to meet certain obligations 
under the terms of the revised amended agreement  the buyer is no longer required to issue a standby letter of credit in our favor to cover any remaining exposure related to our bonded obligations 
instead  pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  the buyer entered into indemnity agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in connection with our bonded obligations 
therefore  if the buyer is unable to meet its contractual obligations  the surety bonding company can seek its remedies under the indemnity agreement 
if the surety bonding company  however  pays the amounts due under the bonds  the surety bonding company will seek reimbursement of such 
table of contents payment from us 
accordingly  we may incur losses in the future related to these contingent liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in the revised amended agreement 
the buyer of the department of transportation related projects and assets filed for bankruptcy protection in october  which increased the likelihood that we could be required to assume certain obligations associated with these projects 
as of december   we have completed the work associated with these projects and do not believe we have any further obligations thereunder 
should additional costs arise  we could incur future losses which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
risks related to our company and our common stock we have a significant amount of debt 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
we have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding debt 
this level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations  our failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements  which could trigger an event of default that results in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate requirements  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  including borrowings under our credit facility  preventing us from paying dividends  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business  the industry in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital  and some of these activities may be on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive 
our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations 
currently  we intend to settle the principal amounts of our new senior convertible notes upon any conversion thereof in cash 
as of december   there was outstanding million aggregate principal amount of our new senior convertible notes 
notwithstanding our present intention to settle conversions of our new senior convertible notes in cash  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so due to provisions in our credit facility  which restrict the repurchase or prepayment of certain unsecured indebtedness  including our senior notes due and senior convertible notes due  unless the we have at least million of remaining liquidity as defined in the credit facility after any such repurchase or prepayment 
if we were required to settle conversions of our new senior convertible notes in accordance with our stated intent to settle principal amounts due in cash  and we were unable to do so with existing cash balances or through our credit facility  we could be required to obtain additional funding or settle such conversions in shares of our common stock  which would be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we cannot be certain that such funding would be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 

table of contents there may be future sales or other dilution of our equity  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in connection with certain completed acquisitions and financing transactions  we have issued shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock  and in addition  we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash as consideration for future earn out obligations 
we may agree to issue additional securities in connection with other future acquisition or financing transactions  which  if issued  would dilute your share ownership and could lead to volatility in our common stock price 
we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions 
one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities 
in connection with certain completed acquisitions  we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash for certain earn out obligations 
such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price 
our amended and restated articles of incorporation provide that we may issue up to a total  shares of common stock  of which  shares were outstanding as of december  we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes  in connection with future acquisitions or other issuances of our common stock or convertible securities  including outstanding options and warrants  or otherwise  will dilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity linked securities 
we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity related securities would have on the market price of our common stock 
a small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions 
jorge mas  our chairman  jose mas  our chief executive officer and other members of the mas family who are employed by mastec  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of december  accordingly  they are in a position to influence the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders  including any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the nomination of individuals to our board of directors  and a change in our control 
these factors may discourage  delay or prevent a takeover attempt that shareholders might consider in their best interests or that might result in shareholders receiving a premium for their common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  highly volatile 
during the three years ended december   our common stock fluctuated from a high of per share to a low of per share 
we may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock 
numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock  including announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors  future sales of our common stock or other securities  including any shares issued in connection with earn out obligations for any past or future acquisition  announcements by us or one of our competitors of new or terminated customers or new  amended or terminated contracts  market conditions for providers of services to communications  utilities and government customers  conversions or anticipated conversions of our senior convertible notes  or any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon such conversion  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts  and announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years  which have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile  and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause shareholders to lose some or all of their investment in our common stock 

table of contents our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of florida law contain anti takeover provisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  by laws and the florida business corporation act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management  even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
at any annual meeting of our shareholders  our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one third of the directors on our board of directors 
consequently  it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our board of directors  which may discourage hostile takeover bids 
in addition  our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors  without further shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of holders of our common stock  including the granting of voting control to others  which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control
