asia markets macao macao is the largest gaming market in the world and the only market in china to offer legalized casino gaming 
according to macao government statistics  annual gaming revenues reached billion in  a increase over we believe that macao will continue to experience meaningful growth in both gaming and non gaming revenues and the record million visitors macao welcomed in will continue to increase 
we believe this growth will result from a variety of factors  including the movement of chinese citizens to urban centers in china  the introduction of new transportation infrastructure and the coming significant increase in hotel room inventory 
table games are the dominant form of gaming in asia  with baccarat being the most popular game 
with the increase in the mass gaming market  we have seen a significant increase in slot machine play and expect this business to continue to grow in macao 
we intend to continue to introduce more modern and popular products that appeal to the asian marketplace and believe that our high quality gaming product has enabled us to capture a meaningful share of the overall macao gaming market  including the vip player segment 
proximity to major asian cities more than billion people are estimated to live within a three hour flight from macao and more than billion people are estimated to live within a five hour flight from macao 
visitors from hong kong  southeast china  taiwan and other locations in asia can reach macao in a relatively short period of time  using a variety of transportation methods  and visitors from more distant locations in asia can take advantage of short travel times by air to macao  zhuhai  shenzhen  guangzhou or to hong kong followed by a road  ferry or helicopter trip to macao 
in addition  numerous air carriers fly directly into macao international airport from many major cities in asia 
macao draws a significant number of customers who are visitors or residents of hong kong 
one of the major methods of transportation to macao from hong kong is the jetfoil ferry service  including our ferry service  the cotai strip cotaijet 
macao is also accessible from hong kong by helicopter 
in addition  the proposed bridge linking hong kong  macao and zhuhai is expected to reduce the travel time between central hong kong and macao and is expected be completed sometime between and competition in macao gaming in macao is administered by the government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires  of which we are one 
no additional concessions have been granted by the macao government since  however  if the macao government were to allow additional gaming operators in macao through the grant of additional concessions or subconcessions  we would face additional competition 
sociedade de jogos de macau sa sjm holds one of the three concessions and currently operates facilities throughout macao 
historically  sjm was the only gaming operator in macao  with many of its gaming facilities being relatively small locations that are offered as amenities in hotels  however  some are large operations  including the hotel lisboa and the grand lisboa 

table of contents wynn resorts macau  sa wynn resorts macau  a subsidiary of wynn resorts limited  holds a concession and owns and operates the wynn macau and encore at wynn macau  which opened in september and april  respectively 
in  wynn resorts macau sold its subconcession right under its gaming concession to an affiliate of publishing and broadcasting limited pbl  which permitted the pbl affiliate to receive a gaming subconcession from the macao government 
in may  the pbl affiliate opened the crown macao  now known as altira 
in june  the pbl affiliate opened the city of dreams  an integrated casino resort located adjacent to our sands cotai central  which includes crown towers  hard rock and grand hyatt hotels 
galaxy casino company limited galaxy holds the third concession and has the ability to operate casino properties independent of our subconcession agreement with galaxy and the macao government 
galaxy currently operates five casinos in macao  including starworld hotel  which opened in october  and galaxy macau  which is located near the venetian macao and opened in may mgm grand paradise limited  a joint venture between mgm resorts international and pansy ho chiu king  obtained a subconcession from sjm in april  allowing the joint venture to conduct gaming operations in macao 
the mgm grand macau opened in december and is located on the macao peninsula adjacent to the wynn macau 
our macao operations also face competition from other gaming and resort destinations  both in asia and globally 
singapore singapore is regarded as having the most developed financial and transportation infrastructure in the southeast asia region 
singapore has established itself as a destination for both business and leisure visitors  offering convention and exhibition facilities as well as world class shopping malls and hotel accommodations 
in  after a competitive bid process  the singapore government awarded two concessions to develop and operate two integrated resorts 
we were awarded the concession for the marina bay site  which is adjacent to singapore s central business district  and genting international was awarded the second integrated resort site  located on singapore s sentosa island 
based on figures released by the singapore tourism board the stb  singapore welcomed million international visitors in  a increase compared to  and tourism receipts are estimated to have reached billion singapore dollars sgd  approximately billion at exchange rates in effect on december  in  a increase compared to the casino regulatory authority the cra  the gaming regulator in singapore  does not disclose gaming revenue for the market and thus no official figure exists 
junket operators do not operate in singapore  unlike most other asian casino markets 
we believe marina bay sands is ideally positioned within singapore to cater to both business and leisure visitors 
the integrated resort is centrally located within a minute drive from singapore s changi international airport and near the new deep water cruise ship terminal  which is scheduled to open in the second quarter of  and a recently opened mass rapid transit station 
marina bay sands is also located near several entertainment attractions  including the gardens by the bay botanical gardens  which is expected to open in june  and the planned singapore sports hub  a sports complex that will feature a new  seat national stadium 
to date  the overall gaming market consists of a balanced contribution from both the vip and mass gaming segments 
consistent with our experience in macao  baccarat is the preferred table game in both the vip and mass gaming segments 
additionally  contributions from slot machines and from the mass gaming segment  including electronic table games offerings  have enhanced the early growth of the market 
as marina bay sands and the singapore market as a whole continue to mature  we expect to broaden our visitor base to continue to capture visitors from around the world 
proximity to major asian cities more than airlines operate in singapore  connecting it to over cities in countries 
in  million passengers passed through singapore s changi airport  a increase as compared to the estimated population within a hour flight of singapore is more than billion 
based on figures released by the stb  the largest source markets for visitors to singapore in were indonesia and china 
the stb s methodology for reporting visitor arrivals does not recognize malaysian citizens entering singapore by land  although this method of visitation is generally thought to be substantial 

table of contents competition in singapore gaming in singapore is administered by the government through the award of licenses to two operators  of which we are one 
pursuant to the request for proposals to develop an integrated resort at marina bay  singapore the request for proposal  the cra is required to ensure that there will not be more than two casino licenses during a ten year exclusive period that began on march  resorts world sentosa  which is owned by genting singapore and located on sentosa island  began its phased opening on january   and is primarily a family tourist destination connected to singapore via a meter long vehicular and pedestrian bridge

las vegas market the las vegas hotel casino industry is highly competitive 
hotels on the las vegas strip compete with other hotels on and off the las vegas strip  including hotels in downtown las vegas 
in addition  several large projects in las vegas are currently suspended and when opened may target the same customers as we do 
we also compete with casinos located on native american tribal lands 
the proliferation of gaming in california and other areas located in the same region as our las vegas operating properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our las vegas operating properties also compete  to some extent  with other hotel casino facilities in nevada and atlantic city  hotel casino and other resort facilities elsewhere in the country and the world  internet gaming websites and state lotteries 

table of contents in addition  certain states have legalized  and others may legalize  casino gaming in specific areas 
the continued proliferation of gaming venues could have a significant and adverse effect on our business 
in particular  the legalization of casino gaming in or near major metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the current global trend toward liberalization of gaming restrictions and the resulting proliferation of gaming venues could result in a decrease in the number of visitors to our las vegas operating properties  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
also  on december   the us department of justice reversed previous opinions on the permissibility of state sanctioned lottery sales on the internet on an intrastate basis 
those states that permit these distribution channels may also expand the gaming offerings of their lotteries in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our business 
las vegas generally competes with trade show and convention facilities located in and around major us cities 
within las vegas  the sands expo center competes with the las vegas convention center the lvcc  which currently has approximately million gross square feet of convention and exhibit facilities 
in addition to the lvcc  some of our las vegas competitors have convention and conference facilities that compete with our las vegas operating properties 
competitors of our las vegas operating properties that can offer a hotel casino experience that is integrated with substantial trade show and convention  conference and meeting facilities  could have an adverse effect on our competitive advantage in attracting trade show and convention  conference and meeting attendees 
retail mall operations we own and operate retail malls at our integrated resorts at the venetian macao  four seasons macao  marina bay sands and sands bethlehem

with the completion of sands cotai central  we will own approximately million square feet of gross retail space
