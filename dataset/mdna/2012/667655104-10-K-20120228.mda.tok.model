item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s nw natural financial condition  including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the years ended december    and unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nw natural and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries which include gill ranch storage  llc gill ranch  nw natural energy  llc nwn energy  nw natural gas storage  llc nwn gas storage  and nng financial corporation nng financial 
these statements also include accounts related to an equity investment in palomar gas holdings  llc pgh  which is pursuing the development of a proposed natural gas pipeline through its wholly owned subsidiary palomar gas transmission  llc palomar 
these accounts make up our regulated local gas distribution business  our regulated gas storage businesses  and other regulated and non regulated investments primarily in energy related businesses 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated local gas distribution business local distribution company  and the term non utility is used to describe our regulated gas storage businesses gas storage as well as our other regulated and non regulated investments and business activities other 
for a further discussion of our business segments  see note in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on consolidated earnings 
all references in this section to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares 
we also present free cash flow as we believe this supplemental information enables the reader of the financial statements to better understand our cash generating ability and to benefit from seeing cash flow results from management s perspective in addition to the traditional gaap presentation see cash flows financing activities  below 
we use such non gaap ie non generally accepted accounting principles measures in analyzing our financial performance because we believe that they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating nw natural s financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary highlights of include consolidated earnings of million and per share in  compared to million and in  net income from utility operations decreased million  from million in to million in  net income from gas storage operations decreased million  from million in to million in  net operating revenues margin increased percent  from million in to million in  total operating expenses increased percent  from million in to million in  cash flow from operations increased million  from million in to million in  utility customer growth rate was percent in  compared to percent in  and dividends paid increased percent  from per share in to in  reflecting the th consecutive year of dividend increases to shareholders 
our primary businesses consist of regulated utility and gas storage operations 
factors critical to the success of the utility include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring an adequate supply of natural gas  providing distribution services at competitive prices  and being able to recover our operating and capital costs in the rates charged to customers in a reasonable and timely manner 
our utility business is regulated by two state commissions  the public utility commission of oregon opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
factors critical to the success of our gas storage business include developing and operating storage capacity at competitive market prices  retaining customers and successfully marketing available storage capacity to new customers  planning for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve growing demands of its core customers  charging adequate rates to recover investment and operating costs  and being able to obtain financing to fund expansions and working capital requirements 
our gas storage businesses are  in part  regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and the opuc 

table of contents outlook in  we will be focused on strengthening our core businesses  enhancing our strategic position  advancing key business projects  and leveraging our organizational resources 
strengthen core businesses 
our core businesses are local gas distribution utility and gas storage 
in the utility  we will continue our efforts to develop  integrate  consolidate and streamline our operations using new technologies  which are expected to include a workforce scheduling system  a procurement system  and an automated dispatching system 
in our storage business  we will focus on maximizing our storage capacity and optimizing our revenue opportunities 
we believe that investing in operating efficiencies and in marketing opportunities for our core businesses positions us well for growth now and into the future as the economy recovers 
enhance strategic position 
we believe our core businesses are positioned strategically and competitively 
the decline in gas prices and the abundance of shale gas supplies creates opportunities for both core businesses 
specifically  it creates opportunities for us to expand our market share in the utility by leveraging our natural gas competitive price advantage 
moreover  our gas storage facilities strategically position us to quickly respond to market demand with storage capacity when gas prices increase or become more volatile 
together  our businesses competitively position us to meet market demands when the economy recovers 
advance key projects 
we seek to create shareholder value by innovatively addressing the needs of our customers  employees and the communities we serve while addressing economic  regulatory and environmental challenges 
to that end  we are advancing key business projects such as acquiring long term gas reserves on behalf of our utility customers  pursuing future storage opportunities at mist  and improving our operations at gill ranch 
we also continue to pursue regional solutions for reliable and safe energy needs through our investment in natural gas infrastructure  such as the palomar pipeline 
leverage resources 
our employees are our most valued resource 
to support and leverage this valuable resource  we will continue to invest in new technologies and improve our facilities 
we believe this will allow us to maintain a positive and safe work environment  to provide on going training and workforce development  and also to gain greater operational efficiency 
issues  challenges and performance measures economic weakness 
weakness in local  national and global economies continues to impact utility customer growth  business demand for natural gas and market prices for gas storage 
our utility s customer growth rate remained relatively flat for the third year in a row at percent  compared to percent in and percent in the local economy is beginning to show signs of a slow recovery as unemployment rates in oregon and southwest washington dropped from approximately percent in to about percent at the end of  and industrial demand for natural gas increased in by percent over we believe our utility is well positioned to add customers as the economy recovers because of low and stable natural gas prices  our relatively low market penetration  our ongoing focus on converting homes and businesses to natural gas  and the potential for environmental initiatives that could favor natural gas use in our region 
managing gas prices and supplies 
our gas acquisition strategy is regularly updated to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility customers and to hedge gas prices so that we can effectively manage costs  reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage 
with recent developments in drilling technologies and substantial access to supplies from shale gas formations around the us and in canada  the supply outlook for north american natural gas is strong  which is contributing to lower and more stable gas prices 

table of contents the purchased gas adjustment pga mechanisms in oregon and washington  along with our gas price hedging strategies  including gas reserves and storage supplies  enable us to reduce earnings exposure for the company and secure lower gas costs for our customers 
these lower gas prices  coupled with our focus on customer service and cost effective energy efficiency programs  can help strengthen natural gas competitive advantage over other energy sources in key markets 
we typically hedge gas prices on approximately percent of our anticipated year round sales volumes based on normal weather 
for the gas year november  october   we entered the gas year hedged at a level of approximately percent of our forecasted sales volumes  including percent financially hedged and percent physically hedged with a combination of gas inventories in storage  local production from the mist area  and production of gas reserves from our investment with encana oil gas usa inc encana 
the production of gas reserves is related to a new investment we made beginning in to hold working interests in leases related to both currently producing and new wells in encana s jonah gas field located in rock springs  wyoming 
for further discussion of gas reserves  see investments in gas reserves under strategic opportunities below and gas reserves under rate mechanisms below 
in addition to the amount of gas hedged for the current gas contract year  we are also hedged at approximately percent for the gas year and between and percent hedged for annual requirements over the following five gas years 
our hedge levels are subject to change based on actual load volumes  which depend to a certain extent on weather and economic conditions 
also  our storage levels may increase or decrease based on storage expansion or storage recall by the utility 
as for gas reserves  these levels are estimates of production  which are subject to change based on possible unforeseen events that include the impact from speed of drilling and the volume of production 
although stable gas prices provide opportunities to manage costs for our utility customers  they also present challenges for our gas storage business 
stable natural gas prices may reduce the pricing for storage services 
we are focused on improving the results from our gas storage businesses 
environmental costs 
we accrue all material environmental loss contingencies related to our properties that require environmental investigation or remediation 
due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the preliminary nature of investigations or the developing nature of remediation requirements  actual costs could vary significantly from our loss estimates 
as a regulated utility  we are allowed to defer certain costs pursuant to regulatory decisions 
we currently have regulatory approval to defer certain environmental costs  and to seek recovery of these amounts in future rates to customers 
however  we are expected to pursue recovery from insurance policies and only seek recovery from customers for amounts not covered by insurance 
ultimate recovery of environmental costs  either from regulated utility rates or from insurance  will depend on our ability to effectively manage costs and demonstrate that costs were prudently incurred 
recovery may vary significantly from amounts currently recorded as regulatory assets  and amounts not recovered would be required to be charged to income in the period they were deemed to be unrecoverable 
see note climate change 
we recognize that our businesses are likely to be impacted by future carbon constraints  and we are seeking clean energy growth opportunities that position us for long term success in a lower carbon energy economy and to advance our customers interests in energy conservation  efficiency and environmental stewardship 
a variety of federal  state  local and international climate change initiatives  including new regulations  are underway  but we cannot determine the impact of these initiatives at this time 
for example  an array of environmental protection agency epa rules impacting coal plants may cause some coal plants to shut down early although the epa is not mandating coal plant closures 
coal plant shut downs could increase the demand for natural gas as a lower carbon emission fuel and create opportunities for us 
similarly  because natural gas has a relatively low carbon content  it is also possible that future carbon constraints could create additional demand for natural gas for base load electric generation  direct use in homes and businesses  backing up intermittent renewable resources and as a transportation fuel to displace gasoline and diesel 
under epa s greenhouse gas reporting rules adopted in  we report system throughput to the epa on an annual basis 
the first report under these provisions was due to epa in september epa also issued additional greenhouse gas reporting regulations in  which required mandatory reporting of unintended greenhouse gas releases from petroleum and natural gas facilities 
the first report is due under these rules in september while our co equivalent emission levels are relatively small  the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations  could result in an increase in the prices we charge our customers or a decline in the demand for natural gas 

table of contents performance measures 
in order to deal with the challenges affecting our businesses  we annually review and update our strategic plan to map out a course for the next several years 
our plan includes strategies for further improving our utility gas distribution system  enhancing utility services and operations  optimizing and growing our non utility gas storage businesses  investing in natural gas infrastructure projects when necessary to support the energy needs of our region  and maintaining a leadership role within the gas utility industry by addressing long term energy policies and pursuing business opportunities that support new clean energy technologies 
we intend to measure our performance and monitor progress on relevant metrics including  but not limited to earnings per share growth  total shareholder return  return on invested capital  utility return on equity  utility customer satisfaction ratings  utility margin  utility capital and operations and maintenance expense per customer  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and ebitda 
strategic opportunities business process improvements 
we continue to evaluate  develop and implement business strategies to improve operational efficiencies and respond to economic and competitive challenges 
over the last few years  our efforts have been to develop  integrate  consolidate and streamline operations  while supporting our employees with training and new technology tools 
from through  we reduced staffing levels in response to work load declines related to the low customer growth environment and efficiency improvements  resulting in a reduction of full time  utility positions from over  in early to about  at the end of technology investments  workforce reductions and other initiatives have contributed to a significant increase in productivity 
the number of utility customers served per operating employee increased by percent  from at the end of to at the end of these efforts are expected to contribute to long term operational efficiencies and lower operating and capital costs throughout nw natural 
however  we continue to look for new ways to improve our business as service demands and system safety requirements increase and we remain committed to increasing shareholder value 
gas storage development 
we own and operate two underground gas storage facilities the mist facility in oregon and the gill ranch facility in fresno  california 
our wholly owned subsidiary  gill ranch  holds a percent undivided ownership interest in the gill ranch facility  with pacific gas and electric company pg e owning the other percent interest 
the initial development of gill ranch was designed to provide us with bcf of gas storage capacity by the end of  with pipeline capacity on miles of gas transmission pipeline connecting the gill ranch facility to an interconnect on pg e s transmission system 
see note due to an abundant supply of natural gas and lower  more stable prices in north america  current storage values are expected to remain low in the near term  which will likely affect the prices at which gill ranch is able to contract 
gas prices have hit a year low and this has resulted in certain natural gas producers reducing their levels of exploration and production 
at the same time  we expect these lower gas prices to increase demand for natural gas as the pricing provides a competitive advantage over alternative fuel sources including potential demand for exporting natural gas 
combined  these forces may ultimately result in upward pressure on gas prices and return some price volatility to natural gas markets 
our storage facilities help position us to capitalize on rising demand  increasing gas prices or greater market volatility because storage operations benefit from seasonal swings in commodity pricing and market volatility 
additionally  if market demand increases and we are able to obtain financing and regulatory permits  we have the ability to expand the gill ranch facility beyond its current capacity without further expansion of our gas transmission pipeline 
we estimate that the current gill ranch storage facility could support an aggregate storage capacity of around bcf with certain infrastructure modifications  of which we would have the rights to percent of the total 
the pacific northwest storage markets also are impacted by lower gas prices and lack of gas price volatility  although less than california markets primarily because of fewer regional competitors 
nevertheless  we continue to plan for expansion of our gas storage facilities at mist in anticipation of increased natural gas demand for electric generation in the pacific northwest 
currently we do not have a set timeline for development  but we believe the earliest timeframe for completing the next mist expansion is in the meantime  we expect to continue working on preliminary design and project scope  which will most likely include the development of storage wells  a second compression station and additional pipeline gathering facilities that would enable future storage expansions 

table of contents pipeline diversification 
currently  our utility operations and gas storage operations at mist depend on a single bi directional interstate transmission pipeline to ship gas supplies 
palomar  a wholly owned subsidiary of pgh  is pursuing the development of a new gas transmission pipeline that would provide an interconnection with our utility distribution system 
pgh is owned percent by our nwn energy subsidiary and percent by transcanada american investments ltd  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of transcanada corporation 
the palomar pipeline was originally proposed with an east and a west segment  but palomar currently plans to design and develop an east only pipeline to serve our utility customers as well as growing natural gas markets in oregon and other parts of the pacific northwest 
in the second quarter of  palomar determined it should discontinue efforts to develop the west segment of the pipeline after the supporting shipper declared bankruptcy 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million for our portion of the unrecovered costs related to the west segment 
regarding the proposed east pipeline segment  palomar negotiated a non binding memorandum of understanding with the williams companies northwest pipeline northwest pipeline  which contemplates northwest pipeline becoming a part owner in the palomar project 
this joint agreement would consolidate the region s efforts to develop a cross cascades pipeline around the use of the palomar route 
northwest pipeline owns and operates the single bi directional pipeline that connects to nw natural s utility distribution system 
the proposed east segment pipeline would be regulated by ferc 
in march  palomar withdrew its original application with ferc for the proposed pipeline in oregon  but at the same time informed ferc that it intends to file a new application with a modified scope that excludes the west segment  after it has conducted a new open season to obtain commercial support for the east segment 
the timing for when the palomar pipeline is expected to be built and placed into service will be dependent upon regulatory permits and commercial support from shippers 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to the investment in the east segment of the project 
this charge was for costs that were determined to be less than probable of recovery in a ferc rate making proceeding because they might be deemed outdated when we refile with ferc 
our investment balance in palomar at december  after the charge was million  which represents our share of palomar s development costs related to the east segment 
see note and see also financial condition cash flows investing activities  below for further discussion on the status of palomar 
gas reserves 
in addition to hedging gas prices with financial derivative contracts  we recently signed an agreement with encana to acquire physical gas supplies to meet a portion of our oregon utility customers requirements over years 
during the first years  we forecast the volumes of gas received under the encana agreement to provide approximately to percent of the average annual requirements of our utility customers 
under the agreement  we expect to invest approximately million to million per year for five years  with our total investment expected to be about million 
we pay a fixed portion of drilling costs per well 
encana assigns to us working interests in leases to certain sections of the jonah gas field  located near rock springs  wyoming 
these sections include both future and currently producing wells 
the working interests will entitle us to receive a portion of the gas produced in these sections 
operation of the wells will be governed by a joint operating agreement under which encana will be the operator  and we will pay our proportionate share of operating costs

consolidated earnings and dividends consolidated net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
consolidated earnings decreased in fiscal year primarily due to the loss of income from the repeal of oregon s legislative rule on utility income tax true up  a refund of utility property taxes in  and a lower earnings contribution from our gas storage segment  which includes the first full year of operations for subsidiaries gill ranch and nwn gas storage 
these decreases were partially offset by increased margin results from sales and transportation revenues reported by our utility gas distribution business 
consolidated returns on average stockholders equity for these three years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
see application of critical accounting policies and estimates regulatory accounting for a discussion of the legislative rule 

table of contents compared to the most significant factors contributing to the million decrease in consolidated net income were a million net charge against utility margin taken in  plus the million of margin revenues accrued in  related to the repeal of oregon s legislative rule on utility income taxes 
see results of operations business segments utility operations regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below for further explanation  a million increase in general taxes  primarily due to a million refund of utility property taxes received in  partially offset by a million decrease in other taxes at the utility  and a million increase in property and other taxes at gill ranch  a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  due to a million increase at the utility and a million increase at gill ranch  and a million increase in operations and maintenance expense  primarily due to a million increase at gill ranch reflecting first year operating expenses 
partially offsetting the above factors were an million increase in utility margin attributable to an increase in customers gas use  reflecting gains from colder weather  customer growth and a slight increase in industrial demand  and a million decrease in income tax expense related to lower taxable income 
compared to the most significant factors contributing to the million decrease in consolidated net income were a million decrease in utility margin from the regulatory gas cost incentive sharing mechanism  which reflects gains of million in compared to gains of million in  a million net loss from gill ranch  and a million net loss from nwn gas storage  primarily reflecting higher operating expenses related to start up activities  a million increase in income tax expense primarily reflecting higher taxable income from the utility  including higher amortization of regulatory tax balances related to pre assets which are offset by increased revenues collected in utility margin  and a million increase in interest expense primarily reflecting the full year effect of lower rate short term debt refinanced with higher rate long term debt during and higher balances of total debt outstanding 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million decrease in utility operating expenses primarily due to lower property tax  payroll  bad debt  and employee benefit costs  a million increase in utility margin from residential and commercial customers  after adjustments for weather and decoupling mechanisms  primarily due to colder weather benefits in the second quarter of when weather normalization was not in effect  customer growth and the rate recovery of higher income tax expenses related to an increase in oregon tax rates and the accelerated amortization of regulatory tax assets  and a million increase in other income primarily due to higher carrying costs from utility deferred regulatory account balances and interest income from a utility property tax refund  partially offset by a decrease in non utility gains from company owned life insurance

application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions 
our most critical estimates and judgments include accounting for regulatory cost recovery and amortizations  revenue recognition  derivative instruments and hedging activities  pensions and postretirement benefits  income taxes  and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed its current estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  see note regulatory accounting our utility is regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish the rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and  to a certain extent  set forth special accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under us gaap 
however  authoritative guidance for regulated operations regulatory accounting require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses and revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
regulatory accounting requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from  or are required to refund them to  customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 
the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of regulatory accounting  which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
because our utility satisfies all three conditions  we continue to apply regulatory accounting to our utility operations 
future accounting changes  regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting for some or all of our regulated businesses 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current accounting  regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of regulatory accounting for our utility activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at december  and are recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
the net balance in regulatory asset and liability accounts as of december  and was million and million  of assets  respectively 
see industry regulation in note 
table of contents revenue recognition utility and non utility revenues  which are derived primarily from the sale  transportation and storage of natural gas  are recognized upon the delivery of gas commodity or services rendered to customers 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered and services rendered to customers  but not yet billed  based on estimates from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based on a percentage estimate of amounts unbilled each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when actual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to lower volumes in december  reflecting warmer weather late in the month  and lower customer billing rates 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at december  was adjusted up or down by percent  then unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
from through  utility revenues included the recognition of a regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid commonly referred to as sb 
under sb  we were required to automatically implement a rate refund  or a rate surcharge  to utility customers on an annual basis 
the refund or surcharge amount was based on estimated differences between income taxes paid and income taxes collected in customer rates 
we recorded the refund  or surcharge  each quarter based on the annual amount to be recognized 
on may  the oregon governor signed senate bill sb  which repealed sb the new law required utilities in oregon to reverse amounts accrued for the and tax years  which resulted in us recording a one time pre tax charge to earnings in the second quarter of in the amount of million million after tax or cents per share 
for further discussion  see results of operations business segments utility operations regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from our gas storage business segment  are recognized upon delivery of service to customers 
revenues from our asset management partner are recognized as earned based on multiple revenue elements  which is generally over the period of each asset management deal  except for contracts with a guaranteed amount which are amortized pro rata over the life of the contract 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities our gas acquisition and hedging policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies 
these policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the accounting rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex 
the contracts that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if certain regulatory conditions are met  then the derivative instrument fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to regulatory accounting see note  industry regulation  and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized in current income 
the gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from  or refund to  utility customers in future periods see regulatory accounting  above 
if a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral  then the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses is recorded in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging see note  derivatives and industry regulation which is either in current income or in accumulated other comprehensive income under common stock equity on the balance sheet 
our derivative contracts outstanding at december  were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data 
our estimate of fair value may change significantly from period to period depending on market conditions and prices 
these changes may have an impact on our results of operations  but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of our derivatives activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment 
for estimated fair value of unrealized gains and losses at december  and  see note 
table of contents commodity based derivative contracts entered into by the utility after our annual pga filing for the current gas contract period are subject to a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
the portion not deferred to a regulatory account pursuant to that sharing agreement is recognized either in current income for contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting or in accumulated other comprehensive income for contracts qualifying for hedge accounting 
derivative contracts not qualifying for regulatory deferral are subject to a hedge effectiveness test to determine the financial statement treatment of each specific derivative 
as of december   all of our derivatives were effective economic hedges and either qualified or were expected to qualify for regulatory deferral or hedge accounting treatment 
we use the hypothetical derivative method under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging to determine the hedge effectiveness for our interest rate swaps and the dollar offset method for other derivative contracts under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
the effectiveness test applied to financial derivatives is dependent on the type of derivative and its use 
the following table summarizes the amount of gains and losses realized from commodity price  interest rate and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain loss on commodity price swaps utility net gain loss on commodity price options utility net gain loss on interest rate swap utility subtotal utility net gain loss on foreign currency forward purchases utility total net gain loss realized realized gains losses from commodity hedges and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
realized gains losses from interest rate hedges are recorded as reductions increases to interest charges over the term of the underlying debt issuances 
unrealized gains and losses from commodity hedges  foreign currency hedges and interest rate hedges  which reflect quarterly mark to market valuations  are generally not recognized in current income or accumulated other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  and are offset by a corresponding balance in derivative instruments see note 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits we maintain two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our regular employees with more than one year of service  several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees  and other postretirement employee benefit plans 
we also have a qualified defined contribution plan retirement k savings plan for all eligible employees 
only the two qualified defined benefit pension plans and retirement k savings plan have plan assets  which are held in qualified trusts to fund the respective retirement benefits 
effective january  and  the qualified defined benefit retirement plans for non union employees and for union employees  respectively  were closed to new participants 
these plans were not available to employees at any of our subsidiary companies 
non union and union employees hired or re hired after december  and  respectively  and our subsidiary employees  are provided an enhanced retirement k savings plan benefit 
also  effective january  the postretirement welfare benefit plan for non bargaining unit employees was closed to new participants after december  net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs retirement benefit costs and projected benefit obligations benefit obligations are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits using a number of key assumptions including discount rates  rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and an expected long term return on plan assets see note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the pension amounts recorded and disclosed 
retirement benefit costs consist of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains  losses and prior service costs  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets  if applicable 
the market related asset valuation reflects differences between expected returns and actual investment returns  which we recognize over a three year period or less from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility in retirement benefit costs 

table of contents accounting standards also require balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax  based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations 
however  the retirement benefit costs relating to our qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are generally recovered in utility rates which are set based on accounting standards for pensions and postretirement benefits  and as such we received approval from the opuc pursuant to regulatory accounting to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability based on expected rate recovery  rather than including it as aoci under common equity see regulatory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation 
the retirement benefit cost for pensions consists of service costs  interest costs  the expected returns on plan assets  and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses 
effective january   we began deferring a portion of our pension expense to a regulatory account on the balance sheet pursuant to opuc approval of pension expenses above or below the amount set in rates 
in  the cumulative amount deferred for future pension cost recovery was million 
the regulatory asset account earns a carrying cost at the authorized cost of capital rate set by the opuc 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension and postretirement assumptions  including evaluations of relevant discount rates  an evaluation of expected long term investment returns based on asset classes and target asset allocations  expected changes in salaries and wages  analyses of past retirement plan experience and current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the december  measurement date  we reviewed and updated our weighted average discount rate assumptions for pensions and other postretirement benefits  which went from percent to percent and from percent to percent  respectively 
the new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of benchmark interest rates to the estimated cash flows  which reflects the timing and amount of future benefit payments 
benchmark interest rates are drawn from the citigroup above median curve  which consists of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by standard poor s s p or aa or higher by moody s investors service moody s  our expected annual rate of future compensation increases  which remained unchanged at a range of to percent  our expected long term return on qualified defined benefit plan assets  which was reduced to percent from percent  and other key assumptions  which were based on actual experience and actuarial recommendations 
at december   our net pension liability benefit obligations less market value of plan assets for the two qualified defined benefit plans increased million compared to the increase in our net pension liability is primarily due to the million increase in our pension obligation 
the liability for non qualified plans increased million and the liability for other postretirement benefits increased million in we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected return  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation 
as of december   the actual annualized returns on plan assets  net of management fees  for the past one year  five years  years and since inception were percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents we believe our pension assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions

 discount rate qualified defined benefit plans non qualified plans other postretirement benefits expected long term return on plan assets qualified defined benefit plans n a accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
at december  and  our net long term deferred tax liability totaled million and million  respectively 
after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our tax returns 
for state income tax and local income taxes  judgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance due to our expectation that all of these assets and liabilities will be realized 
these accounting standards also require the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators require us to flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from  or refunded to  customers in future rates 
at december  and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability 
we received authorization from the opuc and wutc in to accelerate the recovery of these pre regulatory assets through future utility rates 
see notes and uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that require management s assessment of the expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until such positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we would not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and would report the tax effect as a liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had no uncertain tax positions 
the irs completed its examination of the through tax years in the examination resulted in payments of million of tax and million of interest 
the oregon department of revenue odor completed its field examination of our through consolidated oregon income tax returns and issued preliminary assessments 
if sustained by the odor  these assessments would result in an additional state tax liability of approximately million  including interest and penalties 
the company is engaged in discussions with odor to resolve these issues  however  uncertainty exists with respect to the outcome of the audit as a result of information not yet fully considered by the odor 
resolution is expected to be reached within the next months  and we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will prevail on these issues 
as such  no amounts have been recorded in our financial statements as of december  related to this matter 
interest and penalties related to any future income tax deficiencies are recorded in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents accounting for contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies  including estimates of legal costs when such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the low end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to environmental liabilities and related costs  we develop estimates based on a review of information available from numerous sources  including completed studies and site specific negotiations 
using sampling data  feasibility studies  existing technology and enacted laws and regulations  we estimate that the total future expenditures for environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation are million as of december  it is our policy to accrue the full amount of such liability when information is sufficient to reasonably estimate the amount of probable liability 
when information is not available to reasonably estimate the probable liability  or when only the range of probable liabilities can be estimated and no amount within the range is more likely than another  then it is our policy to accrue at the lower end of the range 
accordingly  due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of several site investigations  in some cases  we may not be able to reasonably estimate the high end of the range of possible loss 
in those cases we have disclosed the nature of the potential loss and the fact that the high end of the range cannot be reasonably estimated 
we will continue to seek recovery of such costs through insurance and through customer rates  and we believe recovery of these costs is probable 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made 
see note results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates utility 
we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates and systems of accounts set by the opuc  wutc  and ferc 
the opuc and wutc also regulate our issuance of securities by the utility 
in  approximately percent of our utility gas volumes and revenues were derived from oregon customers and approximately percent from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined by the oregon and washington economies in general  by the pace of growth in the residential and commercial markets in particular  and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our utility gas costs  including operating and maintenance expenses and investment costs made in utility plant and other regulatory assets 
gas storage 
our gas storage business is subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  issuance of securities and systems of accounts set by the opuc  ferc  and the cpuc 
the cpuc regulates gill ranch under a market based rates model which allows for the price for storage services to be set by market conditions 
the opuc and ferc regulate intrastate and interstate storage services  respectively  under a maximum cost of service model which allows for storage prices to be set at or below the cost of service as set in the last approved regulatory filing for each agency 
in  approximately percent of our storage revenues were derived from ferc and oregon approved rates to customers and approximately percent from california approved rates to customers 

table of contents general rate cases oregon 
on december   we filed an application for a general rate increase at the opuc 
in the filing  we have requested an increase in authorized annual oregon jurisdictional revenues of million  equivalent to a rate increase of percent 
the amount and percent of this rate increase includes an estimated million that represents the cumulative effect of declining use per customer 
this cost is already included in customers current rates through the operation of the company s conservation tariff  which has been in place since the increase also includes costs related to pension contributions and additional utility services 
the filing also requests an authorized overall rate of return on capital of percent  with a return on common stock equity roe of percent and a capital structure of percent common equity 
in addition  we have requested the establishment of rate recovery mechanisms for deferred costs related to our environmental liabilities 
the filing also requests rate redesign for residential customers with a higher fixed fee  which would effectively combine and incorporate the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling tariffs in the new fixed fee amount 
the new rates are requested to be effective by november  we are unable to predict the outcome of this rate proceeding 
our most recent general rate case in oregon was effective september the opuc authorized rates to customers based on an roe of percent 
in  in connection with the renewal of our conservation tariff and weather normalization rate mechanism  the opuc approved a stipulation that restricted us from filing a general rate case in oregon prior to september however  in the opuc approved our gas reserve acquisition see rate mechanisms gas reserves below with a condition that we file a general rate case by the end of these agreements did not impact our requirement to file annual rate adjustments to reflect changes in gas purchase costs under the pga mechanism or our ability to collect or refund prior year s gas cost deferrals 
see rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
washington 
our most recent general rate case in washington was in  and in it the wutc authorized rates to customers based on an roe of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
these customer rates went into effect on january   with annual revenue requirements increased by million or percent 
ferc jurisdiction 
we are required under our mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services 
our most recent filing of a cost and revenue study was in april as a result of that proceeding  the current maximum cost based rates for our interstate gas storage services were approved by ferc  with maximum rates unchanged from prior levels approved by ferc in in addition  we made a filing in december to obtain ferc approval to revise the depreciation rates associated with mist assets used to derive the cost based interstate storage rates 
these new depreciation rates were designed to match the depreciation rates for the same type of assets approved under state regulation 
we did not make any changes to the previously approved maximum rates  and ferc approved the depreciation rate filing in may we are required to make our next cost and revenue study filing at ferc on or before december  california 
gill ranch is authorized by the cpuc to charge market based rates for the intrastate storage services offered to customers in california 
rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are established for the utility each year under pga mechanisms in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases  including contract gas purchase prices  gas prices hedged with financial derivatives or physical gas reserves  gas inventory prices  interstate pipeline demand costs  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred regulatory accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year 
in october  the opuc and wutc approved pga rate changes effective november  the effect of these rate changes was to decrease the average monthly bills of oregon and washington residential customers by about percent 
this was our third consecutive year of pga rate decreases  and cumulatively our average utility residential customer bills declined percent in oregon and percent in washington since 
table of contents under the current pga mechanism in oregon  there is an incentive sharing provision whereby we are required to select each year either an percent or percent deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated pga prices  such that the impact on current earnings from the incentive sharing is either percent or percent of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs  respectively 
in addition to the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism  we are subject to an annual earnings test to determine if the utility is earning above its authorized roe threshold 
if utility earnings exceed a specific roe level  then percent of the amount above that level is required to be deferred for refund to customers 
under this provision  if we select the percent deferral option  then we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
if we select the percent deferral option  then we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
we selected the percent deferral option for the  the and the pga years 
the roe threshold is subject to adjustment annually based on movements in long term interest rates 
for calendar years and  the roe threshold after adjustment for long term interest rates was percent and percent  respectively 
no amounts were required to be refunded to customers as a result of the utility earnings test  while we are refunding million to customers in the current pga for the utility earnings test 
for  we accrued an estimated million for potential refund to customers in the next pga 
there has been no change to the washington pga mechanism under which we defer percent of the higher or lower actual gas costs  with those cost differences passed on to customers through an adjustment to future rates 
gas reserves 
in april  the opuc approved the encana gas reserve transaction for utility customers and determined that the company s costs under the agreement will be recovered  plus a rate base return on our investment  on an ongoing basis through our annual pga mechanism  including the regulatory deferral and incentive sharing process for the commodity cost of gas 
annually  a forecast will be established for the amounts related to costs and volumes expected  and any variances between forecasted and actual results will be subject to our pga incentive sharing in oregon  up to a maximum variance of million of which percent or million maximum would be recognized in current income 
variances in excess of million  both negative and positive  will be deferred and passed through to customers in future rates at percent 
conservation tariff 
in october  the opuc authorized the implementation of a conservation tariff to adjust utility margin for changes in consumption patterns due to residential and commercial customers conservation efforts 
the conservation tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between utility earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers  removing any financial incentive by the utility to discourage customers efforts to conserve energy 
in washington  customer use is not covered by a conservation or decoupling tariff  and as such our utility earnings are affected by increases and decreases in usage based on customers conservation efforts 
washington customers account for about percent of our utility volumes and revenues 
the oregon conservation tariff includes two components an annual price elasticity adjustment  which adjusts rates for increases or decreases from expected customer volumes due to changes in commodity costs or changes in our general rates  and a monthly conservation adjustment  which adjusts margin revenues to account for the difference between actual and expected customer volumes also referred to as the decoupling adjustment 
the margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account  which is included in the next annual pga filing 
baseline consumption was determined by customer consumption data used in the oregon general rate case and is adjusted annually for customer growth and the effect of the price elasticity adjustment discussed above 
from to  we have experienced approximately percent decline in average use per residential customer and approximately percent decline in average use per commercial customer 
as a result of these declines  customers have paid surcharges related to a decoupling adjustment in seven of the past nine heating seasons 
see business segments utility operations  below 
in  an independent study was commissioned to measure the effectiveness of oregon s conservation tariff mechanism 
the results of this study recommended continuation of the tariff with minor modifications 
the tariff modifications were approved by the opuc  and the mechanism was extended through october 
table of contents weather normalization tariff 
in oregon  we have an approved weather normalization mechanism applied to residential and commercial customer bills 
this mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather  with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average 
the mechanism is applied to bills between december and may of each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather  which uses the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are based on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers see business segments utility operations  below 
the weather normalization mechanism for oregon utility operations is approved through october customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism  and as of december   percent had opted out 
we do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for washington customers  which account for about percent of our utility volumes and revenues 
industrial tariffs 
the opuc and wutc approve tariffs covering utility service to our major industrial customers  including terms which are intended to give us certainty in the level of gas supplies we need to acquire to serve this customer group 
the terms include  among other things  an annual election period  special pricing provisions for out of cycle changes  and a requirement that industrial customers under our annual pga tariff complete the term of their service election 
system integrity program 
since  various laws requiring minimum standards for integrity management programs and system integrity programs sip for natural gas distribution pipelines have been enacted 
most recently  in january the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty  and job creation act of was signed into law and requires increased civil penalties for pipeline safety violations  improvements in prevention programs for pipelines  and additional review and analysis of various aspects of gas transmission lines 
we are working diligently with industry associations and federal and state regulators to ensure nw natural s compliance with the provisions of this new law 
the opuc has approved specific accounting treatment and cost recovery for our transmission pipeline integrity management program  sip  and the related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa 
we record the costs related to the integrity management program as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each month period  and recover the revenue requirement associated with the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective with the annual pga in oregon 
our sip costs are tracked into rates annually  with rate recovery after the first million of capital costs 
an annual cap for expenditures has been set at million  but extraordinary costs above the cap may be approved with written consent of the opuc staff and other interested parties and approval of the opuc 
the sip allows recovery of costs incurred in oregon during the period from october through the effective date of our next general rate case 
we do not have any special accounting or rate treatment for our sip costs incurred in the state of washington 
environmental costs 
the opuc has authorized us to defer environmental costs associated with certain named sites and to accrue a carrying cost on environmental costs paid  subject to an annual demonstration that we have maximized our insurance recovery or made substantial progress in securing insurance recovery for unrecovered environmental expenses 
through a series of extensions  the authorized cost deferral and accrual of carrying costs was extended through january in january  we filed a request with the opuc to continue our deferral of these environmental costs 
see note for further discussion of our regulatory and insurance recovery of environmental costs 
the wutc has also authorized the deferral of environmental costs  if any  that are incurred in connection with services provided to washington customers 
the order granting approval of that request was effective january  pension deferral 
effective january   the opuc approved our request to defer annual pension expenses above the amount set in rates in our last general rate case  with recovery of these deferred amounts through the implementation of a balancing account  which includes the expectation of higher and lower pension expenses in future years 
our recovery of these deferred balances includes accrued interest on the account balance at the utility s authorized rate of return  which is currently percent 
the reduction to operations and maintenance expense for was million 
future years deferrals will depend on changes in plan assets and projected benefit liabilities using a number of key assumptions  as well as our pension contributions 
we estimate deferrals totaling million to million in see application of critical accounting policies and estimates  above 

table of contents customer credits for gas storage sharing 
in june  million was credited to oregon utility customers from our regulatory incentive sharing mechanism related to gas storage and asset management services of pipeline capacity and gas storage at mist see gas storage  below 
in june  we credited million to customers under the same regulatory sharing mechanism 
our washington utility customers receive their respective share of this credit as part of the annual pga filing 
in november  a million credit was placed in washington utility customer rates for these activities  compared to a million credit to washington customers in november business segments utility operations utility net operating revenues margins are affected by customer growth  and to a certain extent  by changes in volume due to weather and customer consumption patterns because a significant portion of our revenues are derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in oregon  we have a conservation tariff  which adjusts revenues to offset changes in margin resulting from increases or decreases in average use by residential and commercial customers  and a weather normalization tariff  which adjusts to offset changes in margin resulting from above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
both the conservation and weather normalization mechanisms have the effect of reducing the volatility of our utility earnings 
we also have other regulatory mechanisms  which increase or decrease utility margins to account for other costs and revenues approved by the opuc or wutc 
see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
compared to our utility segment in earned million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the major factors contributing to the change was a million reduction in utility margins related to the repealed oregon legislative rule on utility income taxes paid  including of a million write off in plus a million revenue accrual recognized in  and a net gain of million recognized in related to a refund of property taxes plus accrued interest from a favorable tax ruling 
these were partially offset by increases in residential and commercial customer margins of million  including the effects of weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms  a slight gain in industrial customer margins of million  and an increase in gas cost incentive sharing of million 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in increased percent over last year primarily due to the impact of colder weather on residential and commercial use 
our weather normalization mechanism adjusted residential and commercial margins down by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to a margin increase of million for the year ended december  when weather was percent warmer than average 
our decoupling mechanism adjusted residential and commercial margins up by million in  after adjusting for expected price elasticity impacts from lower pga prices effective november   compared to margin adjustments up by million in compared to our utility segment in earned million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the major factors contributing to the change were reduced operating expenses largely offset by lower utility margins 
the lower margins consisted of a million decrease from the prior year s gas cost incentive sharing  partially offset by a net million increase from residential and commercial customers  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms  and a million increase in industrial margin 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in decreased by percent over last year due to the effects of warmer weather on residential and commercial use and the lingering effects of a weak economy on commercial and industrial use 
the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid increased margin by million compared to our weather normalization mechanism adjusted residential and commercial margins up by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average  compared to a margin reduction of million for the year ended december  when weather was percent colder than average

table of contents residential and commercial sales the primary factors that impact results of operations in the residential and commercial markets are customer growth  seasonal weather patterns  energy prices  competition from other energy sources and economic conditions in our service areas 
typically  percent or more of our annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income is significantly reduced due to our weather normalization mechanism in oregon where about percent of our customers are served 
for more information on our weather mechanism  see regulatory matters rate mechanisms weather normalization  above 
the primary changes that impacted margin from residential and commercial sales were as follows compared to utility volumes were percent higher  primarily reflecting percent colder weather  sales volumes to core utility customers are sensitive to weather variations especially in the winter heating season  utility operating revenues increased million or percent primarily due to the percent volume increase  utility margin increased million or percent primarily due to customer growth of percent and colder weather  with colder weather benefits partially offset by weather normalization adjustments that reduce customer bills and company margins when weather is colder than average 
compared to utility volumes were percent lower  primarily reflecting percent warmer weather  conservation efforts and weak economic conditions  utility operating revenues decreased million or percent primarily due to the percent volume decline and customer rate decreases of and percent in oregon and washington  respectively  effective november   and utility margin increased million or percent primarily due to customer growth of percent and the colder weather in the spring of that was not entirely offset by oregon s weather normalization mechanism 
industrial sales and transportation operating revenues from industrial customers include the commodity cost component of gas sold under sales service but not under transportation service 
therefore  operating revenues from industrial customers can increase or decrease when customers switch between sales service and transportation service  but generally our margins from these customers are unaffected by these changes because we do not generally include a profit mark up for the cost of gas 
as such  we believe volumes delivered and margins are better measures of performance for the industrial sector 
the primary changes that impacted margin from industrial sales and transportation were as follows compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  or percent  reflecting increased energy demand  with the majority of the increased volume attributable to the manufacturing sector  and margins increased million  or percent 
compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  and margin increased million  or percent 
the slight margin increases in and were primarily due to an increase in industrial use of natural gas as a result of higher costs for oil and propane fuels  which caused some customers to switch to natural gas 
partially offsetting this trend was the loss of a few large industrial customers due to the economy 

table of contents regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid from through  oregon law required the company and certain regulated natural gas and electric utilities to annually review the amount of income taxes collected in rates from utility operations and compare it to the amount the utility actually pays to taxing authorities 
under this law  if the amount paid for income taxes related to utility operations is less than the amount collected from oregon utility customers  then we were required to refund the excess to oregon utility customers 
conversely  if the amount paid in income taxes was more than the amount collected from oregon utility customers  then we were required to collect a surcharge from oregon utility customers 
the company s income tax review resulted in a surcharge to customers each year sb was in effect 
for  the opuc approved the company s recovery of million plus interest from customers 
for the tax year  we originally estimated and accrued million 
however  when sb was signed into law in may of  it effectively repealed the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid for the tax year and all years thereafter  thus resulting in the company recording a million write off in the second quarter of to write off the amount from sb  plus interest  related to tax year 
results related to sb for were a pre tax loss of million  compared to pre tax gains of million in and million in sb requires the opuc to make decisions in future ratemaking proceedings on the amounts of income taxes to be recovered in customer rates 
for additional information  see revenue recognition above under application of critical accounting policies and estimates 
other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as regulatory revenue adjustments  which reflect current period deferrals to and prior year amortizations from  regulatory asset and liability accounts  except for gas cost deferrals which flow through cost of gas sold 
other revenues increased utility margins by million in  compared to million in and million in compared to other revenues decreased to million in primarily reflecting a decrease in the amortization of decoupling adjustments totaling million and a decrease in other regulatory amortizations of million  partially offset by a million increase in the refund to utility customers related to gas storage incentive sharing mechanism and an increase in the current decoupling deferral of million 
decoupling amortizations and other regulatory amortizations from prior year deferrals are included in current or future revenues from residential  commercial and industrial firm customers 
compared to other revenues decreased to in primarily reflecting an increase in the amortization of decoupling adjustments totaling million  partially offset by a million increase in the refund to utility customers related to gas storage incentive sharing mechanism 

table of contents cost of gas sold the cost of gas sold includes gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains and losses from commodity hedges  pipeline demand costs  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals  production from gas reserves  and company gas use 
the opuc and the wutc generally require the natural gas commodity costs to be billed to customers at the same cost incurred or expected to be incurred by the utility 
we have not historically earned a profit or incurred a loss on gas commodity purchases  however  in oregon we have an incentive sharing provision whereby we can either increase or decrease margin revenues from gas cost variances as compared to gas costs embedded in the pga 
under this provision  our net income can be affected by differences between actual and expected purchased gas costs  which occur primarily because of market fluctuations and volatility affecting unhedged gas purchases 
in addition  we recently entered into a regulatory agreement where we receive a rate base return on our investment in gas reserves 
see regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment and regulatory matters rate mechanisms gas reserves  above 
we use natural gas commodity based hedge contracts derivatives  primarily fixed price commodity swaps  consistent with our financial derivatives policies to help manage our exposure to rising gas prices 
gains and losses from financial hedge contracts are generally included in our pga prices and normally do not impact net income because the hedge prices are usually percent passed through to customers in annual rate changes  subject to a regulatory prudency review 
however  utility hedge contracts entered into after the annual pga rates are set in oregon can impact net income because we would be required to share in any gains or losses compared to the corresponding commodity prices included in rates in the pga 
in washington  percent of the actual gas costs  including hedge gains and losses allocated to washington gas sales  are passed through in customer rates see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above  and note 
the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in cost of gas sold compared to total cost of gas sold increased million  or percent  due to an percent increase in total sales volumes partially offset by a percent decrease in the average cost of gas sold per therm  the average gas cost collected through rates decreased from cents per therm in to cents per therm in  primarily reflecting lower commodity prices that were passed through to pga rate decreases effective november  and  and hedge losses totaling million were realized and included in cost of gas sold for the year ended december   compared to million of hedge losses in the same period of compared to total cost of gas sold decreased million  or percent  due to a percent decrease in total sales volumes and a percent decrease in the average cost of gas sold per therm  the average gas cost collected through rates decreased from cents per therm in to cents per therm in  primarily reflecting lower commodity prices that were passed through to pga rate decreases effective november  and  and hedge losses totaling million were realized and included in cost of gas sold for the year ended december   compared to million of hedge losses in the same period of actual gas costs in both and were slightly below those embedded in rates  while in actual gas costs were significantly lower 
the effect on shareholders from the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism was a contribution to margin of million in  million in and million in for a discussion of our gas cost incentive sharing mechanism  see regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  above 
gas storage our gas storage segment consists of the non utility portion of our mist underground storage facility and our percent ownership interest in the gill ranch facility 
for the year ended december   we earned million  or cents per share  from gas storage compared to million  or cents per share  for the primary reason for the decline was lower storage pricing driven by lower  more stable gas costs 
at mist  we provide gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets primarily using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of core utility customers requirements 
under a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon  we retain percent of pre tax income from mist gas storage services  and from asset management services  when the underlying costs of the capacity being used are not included in our utility rates  and percent of pre tax income from such storage and asset management services when the capacity being used is included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for credit to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing mechanism in washington for pre tax income derived from gas storage and asset management services 

table of contents our percent undivided ownership interest in the gill ranch facility is held by our wholly owned subsidiary gill ranch  which is also the operator of the project 
our portion of the facility is currently designed to provide bcf of gas storage capacity by the end of gill ranch commenced operations at the end of october and had approximately bcf of storage capacity available for contracting to customers beginning april   which was the beginning of the first full storage injection season at gill ranch  after a partial injection season  which commenced in october see note other our other business segment consists of nng financial  an investment in pgh  and other non utility investments and business activities 
nng financial had total assets of million as of both december  and primarily reflecting a non controlling minority interest in the kelso beaver interstate gas transmission pipeline 
our equity investment in pgh as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
total earnings from our other business segment as of december  and was a net loss of million and net income of million  respectively 
the loss for was primarily due to approximately million of charges on our investment in pgh 
see note consolidated operations operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expense was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million or percent 
the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in operations and maintenance expense compared to a million increase in operating expenses at gill ranch related to the first full year of operations  a million increase in utility payroll expense related to additional field support staff and general pay increases  a million increase in utility health care costs and other related employee benefit expense see further discussion below  a million increase in other non payroll expense at the utility for costs related to the general rate case of million  storage leases of million  and pipeline integrity and corporate ethics initiatives of million  and a million increase in utility bad debt expense see further discussion below 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million decrease in performance bonuses at the utility based on below target results compared to last year  a million decrease in pension expense due to the regulatory deferral of costs above the amount net in rates see further discussion below  and a million decrease in specific consulting and legal fees which were incurred by the utility in related to our successful property tax appeal 
compared to a million decrease in utility payroll expense related to a reduced number of employees 
there was a reduction of employees or percent over the two year period beginning january  a million decrease in utility bad debt expense see further discussion below  a million decrease in pension expense  due to the increase in market value of plan investments from contributions in and  a million decrease in health care and other employee benefit expense due to reduced employee count  offset by an increase in healthcare premiums see further discussion below  and a million decrease in damage claims in 
table of contents partially offsetting the above increases were a million increase in gas storage expenses  primarily related to start up costs including salaries and benefits  power costs  legal fees and investment bank consulting costs  and a million increase for consulting and legal fees at the utility related to a successful property tax appeal 
our bad debt expense as a percent of revenues was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent for the same period last year 
the comparative increase in our bad debt expense ratio was largely due to lower than normal expense ratio in due to improved collections and higher recoveries of delinquent account balances 
despite the modest increase  we believe bad debt losses are comparable to last year and credit risks remain elevated due to the weak economy and high unemployment rates 
higher customer usage from colder weather these past few months may increase our exposure to credit losses in the near term  but we expect bad debt expense over the long term to remain below percent of revenues 
overall national healthcare spending has slowed as a result of the weak economy  however  healthcare trends for the cost of the services provided are forecasted to continue to rise at around percent to percent year over year 
initial projections for increases to employer paid premiums for are estimated to be between percent and percent 
based on our actual premium increase for  nw natural s employer paid portion of health premiums medical  dental  vision are expected to increase percent 
in addition  total pension costs are expected to increase in however  effective january  the opuc approved the deferral of utility pension expense above the amount recovered in rates  which was set in our last general rate case 
the pension expense deferral is recorded to a regulatory balancing account  which reduced operations and maintenance expense by million for  and we expect additional cost deferrals to the pension balancing account in at or above the levels of for further explanation of the pension balancing account  see regulatory matters rate mechanisms pension deferral  above 
general taxes general taxes  which are principally comprised of property and payroll taxes and regulatory fees  increased million  or percent  in compared to  and decreased million  or percent  in compared to the major factors that contributed to changes in general taxes are compared to a million increase due to the refund of property taxes in pursuant to a favorable ruling from the oregon supreme court regarding taxation of utility gas inventory held for sale see further discussion below  and a million increase in property taxes at gill ranch as a result of the first full year of operations 
compared to a million decrease due to the refund of property taxes received in  as mentioned above  partially offset by an increase in property taxes related to a percent increase in net utility plant balances 
prior to  we had been involved for a number of years in litigation with the odor over whether inventories held for sale were required to be taxed as personal property 
in january  the oregon supreme court unanimously ruled in our favor  stating that these inventories were exempt from property tax 
as a result of this ruling  we were entitled to a refund of approximately million  plus accrued interest  for property taxes paid on inventories beginning with the tax year 
we recognized a net million increase in pre tax income in the first quarter of  which consisted of million for the refund of property taxes  million for accrued interest income  and million of increased operations and maintenance expense for legal and consulting services 
we received all of the property tax refunds in 
table of contents depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization expense in increased by million  or percent  as compared to a million or percent increase in over the increased expense in was primarily related to an increase of million in gill ranch s depreciation  plus additional depreciation on investments in utility plant for customer growth and system improvements

table of contents income tax expense the decrease in income tax expense of million  or percent  compared to was primarily due to lower pre tax consolidated earnings 
effective tax rate for and was percent  compared to percent in and percent in income tax expense increased million  or percent  for the year ended december  compared to  primarily due to higher pre tax consolidated earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate 
for the tax year  the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in state tax expense see further discussion below 
for the tax year  the higher effective tax rate was primarily the result of increased amortization of our regulatory tax account on pre utility plant assets see regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above and a lower non taxable gain on company owned life insurance 
for more information on our income taxes  including a reconciliation between the statutory federal and state income tax rates and the effective rate  see note and note in july  the governor of oregon signed house bill establishing increases in the state income tax rate for corporations  and oregon voters approved this legislation in january the corporate income tax rate in oregon increased from percent to percent for tax years and when taxable income was greater than  for tax years and  the state income tax rate decreased to percent  and for years after the tax rate will return to percent  except for corporations with taxable income over million the tax rate will remain at percent 
following existing accounting guidance on income taxes  we re measured our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  resulting in an adjustment to increase the balance by million in approximately million of the adjustment was attributed to our utility operations 
as we anticipate future recovery in rates  we recorded a regulatory asset for the grossed up revenue requirement 
with respect to our non utility business segments  a million adjustment was charged to income tax expense in in we decreased the deferred income tax liability by million as a result of the decrease from percent to percent 
this decrease was almost entirely attributable to the utility business 
financial condition capital structure one of our long term goals is to maintain a strong consolidated capital structure  generally consisting of to percent common stock equity and to percent long term and short term debt 
when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources of financing are also used to fund long term debt redemptions and short term commercial paper maturities see liquidity and capital resources  below  and notes and 
achieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and have access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
our consolidated capital structure was as follows for the years ended december  and december  common stock equity long term debt short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt total 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at december  we also had million in restricted cash at gill ranch as of december   which is being held as collateral for long term debt outstanding  compared to million as of december   which was being held as collateral for equipment purchase contracts and construction loans 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity during periods of volatile capital markets  at times we will maintain higher cash balances  add short term borrowing capacity  and potentially pre fund utility capital expenditures when long term fixed rate environments are attractive 
as a regulated entity  our issuance of equity securities and most forms of debt securities are subject to approval by the opuc and wutc  and our use of proceeds from utility specific issuances are restricted to certain utility purposes 
our use of retained earnings is not subject to those same restrictions 
for the utility segment  our short term liquidity is supported by cash balances  internal cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes  borrowings from multi year credit facilities  cash available from surrender value in company owned life insurance policies  and proceeds from the sale of long term debt 
we use utility long term debt proceeds to finance utility capital expenditures  refinance maturing debt of the utility and provide for general corporate purposes of the utility 
capital markets over the past few years  including the commercial paper market  experienced significant volatility and tight credit conditions  but conditions have been improving as reflected by tighter credit spreads and increased access to new financing for investment grade issuers 
with our current debt ratings see credit ratings  below  we have been able to issue commercial paper and mtns at attractive rates and have not needed to borrow from our back up credit facilities 
in the event that we are not able to issue new debt due to market conditions  we expect that our near term liquidity needs can be met by using cash balances or  for the utility segment  drawing upon our committed credit facilities 
we also have a universal shelf registration filed with the sec for the issuance of secured and unsecured debt or equity securities  subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals 
as of december   we have opuc approval to issue up to million of additional mtns under the existing shelf registration for approved purposes 
in the event that our senior unsecured long term debt credit ratings are downgraded  or our outstanding derivative position exceeds a certain credit threshold  our counterparties under derivative contracts could require us to post cash  a letter of credit or other form of collateral  which could expose us to additional cash requirements and may trigger significant increases in short term borrowings 
if the credit risk related contingent features underlying these contracts were triggered on december   we could have been required to post up to million of collateral to our counterparties  but that assumes our long term debt ratings were downgraded to non investment grade levels  which would be a very significant change from current rating levels for nw natural see note and credit ratings  below 
additionally  in july  the us congress passed and president obama signed into law the wall street reform and consumer protection act 
the legislation requires additional government regulation of derivative and over the counter transactions  and could expand collateral requirements 
while we continue to evaluate the legislation to determine its impact  if any  on our hedging procedures  results of operations  financial position and liquidity  we do not expect to know the full impact of the legislation until final regulations implementing the legislation are issued 
recent developments that may have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources include pension contribution requirements  tax benefits  and environmental expenditures and insurance recoveries 
with respect to pension requirements  we expect to make significant contributions over the next seven years until we are fully funded under the pension protection act rules see pension cost and funding status of qualified retirement plans  below 
with respect to federal income tax liabilities  an extension was granted that allows us to take percent bonus depreciation on qualified expenditures during  and percent bonus depreciation on a majority of our capital expenditures in  which will significantly reduce our tax liability for the and tax years thereby providing cash flow benefits in late and see cash flows operating activities  below 
with respect to environmental liabilities  we expect to continue using cash resources to fund our environmental liabilities  but we also anticipate recovering amounts through insurance or utility rates over the next several years  although the amount and timing of these expenditures and recoveries is uncertain see note 

table of contents our storage segment s short term liquidity is supported by cash balances  internal cash flow from operations  external financing  and to a certain extent on funding from its parent company 
gill ranch has a limited operational history  having begun operations in october although we anticipate operating cash flows to be sufficient for liquidity purposes  the amount and timing of these cash flows are uncertain 
in november  gill ranch issued million of senior secured notes  with fixed interest rate component on million and a variable interest rate on the remaining million 
the average combined interest rate on the notes was percent per annum in these notes are secured by our membership interest in gill ranch storage  llc  and are nonrecourse to nw natural 
the maturity date of these notes is november  under the note agreements  gill ranch is subject to certain covenants and restrictions  including but not limited to  a financial covenant that requires gill ranch to maintain minimum adjusted ebitda at various levels over the term of the notes 
the minimum adjusted ebitda increases incrementally over the first few years  reaching its highest level in the month period beginning april  under the agreements  gill ranch is also subject to a debt service reserve requirement of percent of the outstanding principal amount  initially million  certain prepayment penalties  restrictions on dividends out of gill ranch unless certain earnings ratios are met  and restrictions on incurrence of additional debt 
based on several factors  including our current credit ratings  our commercial paper program  current cash reserves  committed credit facilities  and our expected ability to issue long term debt under our universal shelf registration  we believe our liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near term cash requirements  including all contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below 
dividend policy we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock each year since the stock was first issued to the public in annual common stock dividend payments per share  adjusted for stock splits  have increased each year since the amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock is within the sole discretion of our board of directors 
subject to board approval  we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on common stock 
however  the declarations and amount of future dividends will depend upon our earnings  cash flows  financial condition and other factors including board approval 
off balance sheet arrangements except for certain lease and purchase commitments see contractual obligations  below  we have no material off balance sheet financing arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table shows our contractual obligations at december  by maturity and type of obligation 
payments due in years ending december  thousands thereafter total commercial paper long term debt maturities interest on long term debt postretirement benefit payments capital leases operating leases gas purchases gas pipeline commitments gas reserves other purchase commitments total the majority of postretirement benefit payments are related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans  which are funded by plan assets and future cash contributions

commitment amounts are based on futures prices as of december  for a summary of derivatives liabilities  see note for a summary of gas purchase commitments  see note gas reserves contracts include provisions for cancelation  under which further payment would not be required 
other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders 
these and other contractual obligations are financed with cash from operations and from issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
at december   of our utility employees were members of the office and professional employees international union local no 
in july  these union employees and the company agreed to a new five year labor agreement called the joint accord 
the joint accord provides for a one percent automatic wage increase each year  plus the potential for us to an additional two percent based on wage inflation and other factors 
it also provides competitive health benefits while limiting the cost increases for these benefits to the same level as the annual wage increases 
the term of the new joint accord extends to may   and thereafter from year to year unless either party serves notice of its intent to negotiate modifications to the collective bargaining agreement 
short term debt our primary source of utility short term liquidity is from internal cash flows and the sale of commercial paper 
in addition to issuing commercial paper to meet working capital requirements  including seasonal requirements to finance gas inventories and accounts receivable  short term debt may also be used to temporarily fund utility capital requirements 
commercial paper is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
our outstanding commercial paper  which is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement  is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities see credit agreements  below 
our commercial paper program did not experience any liquidity disruptions as a result of the credit problems that affected issuers of asset backed commercial paper and certain other commercial paper programs over the last several years 
at december  and  our utility had commercial paper outstanding of million and million  respectively 
the effective interest rate on the utility s commercial paper outstanding at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents in march  gill ranch entered into a cash collateralized credit facility for up to million  which was extended through september  in june  gill ranch repaid its million bank loan outstanding using the proceeds from its cash collateralized account 
the effective interest rate on the gill ranch credit facility was percent during credit agreements we have a syndicated multi year credit agreement for unsecured revolving loans totaling million 
the original term of this credit agreement was extended through may  all lenders under our syndicated agreement are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of december  see table below 
we also had three bilateral credit agreements totaling million in effect from november  through march  for seasonal working capital needs 
loan commitment in thousands syndicated lender rating  by category facility aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total based on credit market conditions  it is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency 
however  based on our current assessment of our lenders creditworthiness  including a review of capital ratios  credit default swap spreads and credit ratings  we believe the risk of lender default is minimal 
as discussed above  we extended commitments with all of our lenders under the million syndicated agreement through may  this syndicated agreement also allows us to request increases in the total commitment amount from time to time  up to a maximum amount of million 
this syndicated agreement also permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to the applicable total borrowing commitment 
any principal and unpaid interest amounts owed on borrowings under the credit agreements are due and payable on or before the maturity date 
there were no outstanding balances under these credit agreements at december  and these agreements require us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
we were in compliance with this covenant at december  and  with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of percent and percent  respectively 
the syndicated agreement also requires that we maintain credit ratings with s p and moody s and notify the lenders of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings by such rating agencies 
a change in our debt ratings by s p or by moody s is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement 
however  a change in our debt rating below bbb by s p or baa by moody s would require additional approval from the opuc prior to issuance of utility debt  and interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreements are tied to debt ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreements when ratings are changed see credit ratings  below 

table of contents credit ratings our debt credit ratings are a factor in our liquidity  affecting our access to the capital markets  including the commercial paper market 
our debt credit ratings also have an impact on the cost of funds and the need to post collateral under derivative contracts 
a change in our ratings below bbb by s p or baa by moody s would require additional approval from the opuc prior to our issuing additional long term debt

table of contents new accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  see note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  commodity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and weather risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into spot  short term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated pipeline transportation contracts  to manage our commodity supply risk 
historically  we have arranged for physical delivery of an adequate supply of gas  including gas in our mist storage facility  to meet the expected requirements of our core utility customers 
our gas purchase contracts are primarily index based and subject to monthly re pricing  a strategy that is intended to reflect market price trends during the upcoming year 
commodity price and storage value risk natural gas commodity prices and storage values are subject to market fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion  drilling technologies  potential market speculation and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
in addition to managing storage positions through a combination of short and long term fixed price contracts  we use commodity price financial swap and option contracts financial hedge contracts to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed or capped prices  and physical gas reserves from a long term investment with encana  for utility gas purchase requirements 
these financial hedge contracts and gas reserve volumes are generally included in our annual pga filing for recovery  subject to a regulatory prudence review 
we also regularly monitor and manage the financial exposure and liquidity risk of our storage position 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is primarily managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities 
we may also enter into financial derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  options and other hedging instruments  to manage and mitigate interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates for our commodity and commodity related demand charges paid in canadian dollars 
at december  and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of december   all foreign currency forward contracts mature within one year 
if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on december   a loss of million would have been realized see note 
credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers at liquid exchange points 
we evaluate and monitor suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds  in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher or lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price tied to liquid exchange points  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
based on estimated fair value at december   our overall credit exposure relating to commodity hedge contracts is considered to be immaterial as it reflects amounts we owed to our financial derivative counterparties totaling million 
however  changes in natural gas prices could result in counterparties owing us money 
therefore our financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have at least an investment grade credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and specific limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 
due to potential changes in market conditions and credit concerns  we continue to enforce strong credit requirements 
we actively monitor and manage our derivative credit exposure and place counterparties on hold for trading purposes or require cash collateral  letters of credit or guarantees as circumstances warrant 
as of december   we do not have any actual derivative credit risk exposure  which reflects amounts that financial derivative counterparties owe to us 
the following table summarizes our overall credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of the s p or moody s rating or a middle rating if the entity is split rated with more than one rating level difference financial derivative position by credit rating unrealized fair value gain loss thousands aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total in most cases  we also mitigate the credit risk of financial derivatives by having master netting arrangements with our counterparties which provide for making or receiving net cash settlements 
generally  transactions of the same type in the same currency that have a settlement on the same day with a single counterparty are netted and a single payment is delivered or received depending on which party is due funds 
additionally we have master contracts in place with each of our derivative counterparties that include provisions for posting or calling for collateral 
generally we can obtain cash or marketable securities as collateral with one day s notice 
we use various collateral management strategies to reduce liquidity risk 
the collateral provisions vary by counterparty but are not expected to result in the significant posting of collateral  if any 
we have performed stress tests on the portfolio and concluded that the liquidity risk from collateral calls is not material 
our derivative credit exposure is primarily with investment grade counterparties rated aa aa or higher 
contracts are diversified across counterparties to reduce credit and liquidity risk 
credit exposure to insurance companies for environmental damage claims 
we regularly monitor the financial condition of insurance companies who provide or provided general liability insurance policy coverage to nw natural and its predecessors with respect to environmental damage claims 
we have filed claims for our environmental costs with a number of insurance companies 
the majority of these companies have credit ratings of a or better from am best co 
am best 
am best is a global independent credit rating agency who has provided quantitative and qualitative analysis of insurance company balance sheet strength for over years 
am best uses a rating scale that ranges from a superior financial strength to f in liquidation  with a rating of a considered excellent 
a strong credit rating from am best is not a guarantee that an insurance company will be able to meet its contractual obligations 
the remaining insurance companies who do not have credit ratings of a or better are expected to have sufficient funds in reserves to cover these claims 
our credit exposure to insurance companies for environmental claims  which reflects amounts we believe are owed to us  could be material 
in the event we are unable to recover environmental expenses from these insurance policies  we will seek recovery of unreimbursed amounts through customer rates

this mechanism affects customer bills between december through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect gas usage based on average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of december   approximately percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers
