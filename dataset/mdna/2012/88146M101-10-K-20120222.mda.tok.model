overview we acquire  own and operate industrial real estate located in six major coastal us markets los angeles  northern new jersey new york city  san francisco bay area  seattle  miami  and washington  dc baltimore 
we invest in several types of industrial real estate  including warehouse distribution  flex including light industrial and r d and trans shipment 
we target functional buildings in infill locations that may be 
table of contents shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate 
as of december   we owned a total of buildings aggregating approximately million square feet  which we purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including the assumption of mortgage loans payable of approximately million  which includes mortgage premiums of approximately million 
we are an internally managed maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  our investment strategy we invest in industrial properties located in six major coastal us markets los angeles  northern new jersey new york city  san francisco bay area  seattle  miami  and washington  dc baltimore 
we invest in several types of industrial real estate  including warehouse distribution  flex including light industrial and r d and trans shipment 
we target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate 
we selected our target markets by drawing upon the experiences of our management team investing and operating in over global industrial markets located in north america  europe and asia and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes  regulatory and physical constraints  potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors 
we believe that our target markets have attractive long term investment attributes 
we target assets with characteristics that include  but are not limited to  the following located in high population coastal markets  close proximity to transportation infrastructure such as sea ports  airports  highways and railways  situated in supply constrained submarkets with barriers to new industrial development  as a result of physical and or regulatory constraints  functional and flexible layout that can be modified to accommodate single and multiple tenants  acquisition price at a discount to the replacement cost of the property  potential for enhanced return through re tenanting or operational and physical improvements  and opportunity for higher and better use of the property over time 
in general  we prefer to utilize local third party property managers for day to day property management 
we believe outsourcing property management is cost effective and provides us with operational flexibility 
we currently manage four of our properties directly and may directly manage other properties in the future if we determine such direct property management is in our best interest 
we have no current intention to acquire undeveloped industrial land or to pursue ground up development 
however  we may pursue redevelopment opportunities of properties that we own 
we expect that we will continue to acquire the significant majority of our investments as equity interests in individual properties or portfolios of properties 
we may also acquire industrial properties through the acquisition of other corporations or entities that own industrial real estate 
we will opportunistically target investments in debt secured by industrial real estate that would otherwise meet our investment criteria with the intention of ultimately acquiring the underlying real estate 
we currently do not intend to target specific percentages of holdings of particular types of industrial properties 
this expectation is based upon prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions 
the properties we acquire may be stabilized fully leased or unstabilized have near term lease expirations or be partially or fully vacant 

table of contents developments acquisition activity during the year ended december   we acquired industrial buildings containing approximately million square feet for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the properties were acquired from unrelated third parties using existing cash on hand  net of assumed mortgage loans payable of approximately million  which includes mortgage premiums of approximately million  and borrowings on our term loan and credit facility

 shares were sold in the offering to our executive and senior officers and our board of directors 
no underwriting discount or commission was paid on such shares 
on february   we sold an additional  shares of our common stock at a price per share of upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares 
we estimate that the net proceeds of the offering were approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount of approximately million and other estimated offering expenses of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility on january  and intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds to invest in industrial properties and for general business purposes 
amendments to our senior revolving credit facility on january   we entered into a second amendment to amended and restated senior revolving credit agreement the amended facility with keybank national association  as administrative agent and as a lender and the other lenders thereunder  which provides for certain modifications to our million revolving credit facility 
the amended facility extends the maturity date to january  and provides for one month extension option exercisable by us  subject among other things  to there being an absence of an event of default under the amended facility and to our payment of an extension fee 
the amendment provides that outstanding borrowings are limited to the lesser of million and of the value of the borrowing base properties prior to the amendment 
interest on the amended facility will continue to generally be paid based upon  at our option  either i libor plus the applicable libor margin or ii the applicable base rate which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate plus  above the federal funds effective rate  or thirty day libor plus the applicable libor margin for libor rate loans under the amended facility 
the applicable libor margin will range from to to prior to the amendment depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value 
the amended facility requires payment of an annual unused facility fee in an amount equal to or depending on the unused portion of the credit facility 
we will continue to guarantee the obligations of the borrower a wholly owned subsidiary under the amended facility 

table of contents secured financing on january  we entered into a million non recourse mortgage loan at a fixed annual interest rate of that matures on february  the mortgage loan is secured by five of our properties aggregating approximately  square feet 
a portion of these proceeds were used to pay down the term loan 
contractual commitments subsequent to december   we entered into two contracts with third party sellers to acquire two industrial properties as described under the heading contractual obligations in this annual report on form k 
there is no assurance that we will acquire the properties under contract because the proposed acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence  various closing conditions and the consent of the mortgage lender 
distribution activity on february   our board of directors authorized us to declare a cash dividend in the amount of per share of our common stock payable on april  to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on april  outlook we believe that industrial rents have generally stopped falling in our markets and  in some cases  are rising modestly 
with national availability likely ending at above  we believe it will take time before the broader markets exhibit significant rent growth 
we see a growing set of acquisition opportunities 
in the intermediate term we expect to seek to grow our assets to levels that will allow us to optimize our operating efficiency  increase our shareholder liquidity and position us to achieve an investment grade credit rating to broaden our debt financing options 
we believe the long term operating results from our functional  infill coastal assets combined with sound balance sheet management and our strong corporate governance and exceptionally aligned executive management compensation will benefit our shareholders over time 
the primary source of our operating revenues and earnings is rents received from tenants under operating leases at our properties  including reimbursements from tenants for certain operating costs 
we seek long term earnings growth primarily through increasing rents and operating income at existing properties and acquiring properties in our six target markets 
we intend to seek to grow our portfolio by utilizing one or more of cash on hand  future borrowings under our credit facility  future sales of common or preferred equity and future placements of secured or unsecured debt 
in the first two months of  we have completed a public follow on offering of our common stock  amended our credit facility  entered into a secured financing and entered into two contracts to acquire two industrial properties  all as described in this annual report on form k 
inflation although the us economy has been experiencing relatively flat inflation rates recently  and a wide variety of industries and sectors are affected differently by changing commodity prices  inflation has not had a significant impact on us in our markets of operation 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  approximately our outstanding leases expire within five years which enables us to seek to replace existing leases with new leases at the then existing market rate 

table of contents financial condition and results of operations we commenced operations upon the completion of our initial public offering and a concurrent private placement on february  we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed base rents and recoveries of expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  management expenses  insurance  utilities  general and administrative expenses  which include payroll  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  acquisition costs  which include third party costs paid to brokers and consultants  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage loans  term loans and our revolving credit facility 
our consolidated results of operations often are not comparable from period to period due to the impact of property acquisitions at various times during the course of such periods 
the results of operations of any acquired property are included in our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition 
comparison of the year ended december  to the period from february  commencement of operations to december  the majority of the changes in our statements of operations line items for the year ended december  compared to the period from february  commencement of operations to december  are related to property acquisitions that occurred at various times during the course of and in addition  certain of such changes were the result of consisting of a full year of operations compared to consisting of a shorter operating period 
revenues 
total revenues increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase is due primarily to property acquisitions during and in addition  for the quarter and year ended december   approximately million and million  respectively  was recorded in straight line rental revenues related to contractual rent abatements given to certain tenants 
property operating expenses 
property operating expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase is due primarily to property acquisitions during and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase is due to property acquisitions during and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase was driven primarily by our having a full year of expenses for the year ended december  compared to the shorter period from february  commencement of operations to december  acquisition costs 
acquisition costs decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this decrease is due to a lower volume of property acquisitions during the year ended december  compared to the period from february  commencement of operations to december  
table of contents interest expense  including amortization 
interest expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase is due primarily to the assumption of million in mortgage loans payable during and  as well as borrowings on the credit facility and term loan in as a result of the above  net loss decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  liquidity and capital resources the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility with a conservative capital structure using retained cash flows  long term debt and the issuance of common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth 
over the long term  we intend to limit the sum of the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness and the liquidation preference of any outstanding perpetual preferred stock to less than of our total enterprise value  maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of x  limit the principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt to less than of our total consolidated indebtedness  and have staggered debt maturities that are aligned to our expected average lease term years  positioning us to re price parts of our capital structure as our rental rates change with market conditions 
we intend to preserve a flexible capital structure with a long term goal to obtain an investment grade rating and be in a position to issue unsecured debt and perpetual preferred stock 
prior to attaining an investment grade rating  we intend to primarily utilize non recourse debt secured by individual properties or pools of properties with a targeted maximum loan to value of at the time of financing  or recourse bank term loans and credit facilities 
we may also assume debt in connection with property acquisitions which may have a higher loan to value 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund operating requirements  pay interest on any borrowings and fund distributions in accordance with the reit requirements of the federal income tax laws 
in the near term  we intend to fund future investments in properties with term loans  mortgages and borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including with respect to other investments in industrial properties  property acquisitions and scheduled debt maturities  through borrowings under our credit facility  periodic issuances of common stock  perpetual preferred stock  and long term secured and unsecured debt  and  in the future  with proceeds from the disposition of properties 
the success of our acquisition strategy may depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and borrow under our credit facility and to access additional capital through issuances of equity and debt securities 
on january   we completed a public follow on offering of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of 
on february   we sold an additional  shares of our common stock at a price per share of upon the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares 
we estimate that the net proceeds of the offering  after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering costs  were approximately million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility on january  and intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds to invest in industrial properties and for general business purposes 

table of contents as of december   our market equity capitalization was as follows market equity capitalization as of december  security shares outstanding market price market value common stock includes  shares of unvested restricted stock closing price of our shares of common stock on the new york stock exchange on december  in dollars per share we have an million credit facility 
the amount available under our credit facility may be increased up to million  subject to the approval of the administrative agent and the identification of lenders willing to make available additional amounts 
interest on our credit facility will generally be paid based upon  at our option  either i libor plus the applicable libor margin or ii the applicable base rate which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate plus  above the federal funds effective rate  or thirty day libor plus the applicable libor margin for libor rate loans under our credit facility 
prior to our entering into an amendment to our credit facility on january   the credit facility provided that i the applicable margin ranged from to as of december  depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value  ii outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were limited to the lesser of million or of the value of the borrowing base properties and iii we pay an annual unused facility fee in an amount equal to or depending on the unused portion of the credit facility 
on january   we entered into the amended facility  which i extends the maturity date of our credit facility to january  and provides for one month extension option exercisable by us  subject  among other things  to there being an absence of an event of default under the amended facility and to our payment of an extension fee  ii modifies the applicable libor margin to range from to depending on the ratio of our outstanding consolidated indebtedness to the value of our consolidated gross asset value  iii provides that outstanding borrowings under our amended facility are limited to the lesser of million or of the value of the borrowing base properties and iv provides that we pay an annual unused facility fee in an amount equal to or depending on the unused portion of the amended facility 
our unused facility fee was  and  respectively  for the year ended december  and for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  our credit facility includes a series of financial and other covenants requiring  among other things  the maintenance of maximum leverage ratios and minimum fixed coverage ratios that we must comply with in order to borrow under the credit facility 
we have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the borrower a wholly owned subsidiary under our credit facility 
as of december   there were million of borrowings outstanding and ten properties were in the borrowing base under our credit facility 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the credit facility at december  and december  in addition  we have a million term loan that matures on february  interest on the term loan will generally be based upon  at our option  either i libor plus or ii the applicable base rate which is the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate plus  above the federal funds effective rate  or thirty day libor plus for libor rate loans under the term loan 
the term loan includes a series of financial and other covenants that are similar to the covenants in the credit facility 
we have agreed to guarantee the obligations of the borrower a wholly owned subsidiary under the term loan 
we were in compliance with its financial covenants at december  as of december  and  we had outstanding mortgage loans payable of approximately million and million  respectively  and held cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately million and million  respectively

our principal uses of cash are asset acquisitions  debt service  capital expenditures  operating costs and corporate overhead costs 
cash from operating activities 
net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase in cash provided by operating activities is attributable to higher cash flows from property acquisitions during and and a full year of operations during the year ended december   offset by increased payments for prepaid insurance costs

critical accounting policies below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical 
we consider these policies critical because they require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  involve various assumptions and require significant management judgment  and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
applying different estimates or assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our financial statements 
property acquisitions 
upon acquisition of a property  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  buildings and improvements and intangible assets and liabilities consisting of the above and below market leases and the origination value of all in place leases 
we determine fair values using replacement 
table of contents cost  estimated cash flow projections and other valuation techniques and applying appropriate discount and capitalization rates based on available market information 
mortgage loans assumed in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their fair value using current market interest rates for similar debt at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the tangible assets is based on the value of the property as if it were vacant 
land values are derived from current comparative sales values  when available  or management s estimates of the fair value based on market conditions and the experience of our management team 
building values are calculated as replacement cost less depreciation or management s estimates of the fair value of these assets using discounted cash flows analyses or similar methods 
the fair value of the above and below market leases is based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the acquired leases using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases and our estimate of the current market lease rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases when there is not a bargain renewal option 
the capitalized values of above market leases and below market leases are amortized to rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases 
the origination value of in place leases is based on costs to execute similar leases including commissions and other related costs 
the origination value of in place leases also includes real estate taxes  insurance and an estimate of lost rent revenue at market rates during the estimated time required to lease up the property from vacant to the occupancy level at the date of acquisition 
impairment 
carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable 
the intended use of an asset  either held for sale or held for use  can significantly impact how impairment is measured 
if an asset is intended to be held for use  the impairment analysis is based on a two step test 
the first test measures estimated expected future cash flows over the holding period  including a residual value undiscounted and without interest charges  against the carrying value of the property 
if the asset fails the test  then the asset carrying value is measured against the lower of cost or the present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold period 
an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset s carrying value over the lower of cost or the present values of expected cash flows over the expected hold period 
if an asset is intended to be sold  impairment will be determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions  among other things  regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
we determine the estimated fair values based on our assumptions regarding rental rates  lease up and holding periods  as well as sales prices 
when available  current market information is used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates 
if available  current comparative sales values may also be used to establish fair value 
when market information is not readily available  the inputs are based on our understanding of market conditions and the experience of the management team 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
the discount rates used in the fair value estimates will represent a rate commensurate with the indicated holding period with a premium layered on for risk 
revenue recognition 
we record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments 
if tenants fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts  security deposits and letters of credit  then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate 
each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable  including straight line rents  for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed 
we also record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us 
if a tenant remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement  the applicable termination fees are deferred and recognized over the term of such tenants occupancy 

table of contents income taxes 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code and operate as such beginning with our taxable year that ended on december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the irs grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders 
however  we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit 
stock based compensation 
we follow the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  to account for our stock based compensation plan  which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that the cost be measured on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we have adopted the equity plan  which provides for the grant of restricted stock awards  performance share awards  unrestricted shares or any combination of the foregoing 
stock based compensation is recognized as a general and administrative expense in the financial statements and measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected behavior 
the amount of the expense may be subject to adjustment in future periods depending on the specific characteristics of the stock based award 
in addition  we have awarded long term incentive target awards to our executives that are payable in shares of our common stock after the conclusion of each pre established performance measurement period 
the amount that may be earned under the long term incentive plan is variable depending on the relative total shareholder return of our stock as compared to the total shareholder return of the msci us reit index and the ftse nareit equity industrial index over the pre established performance measurement period 
we estimate the fair value of the long term incentive target awards using a monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant 
these awards are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite period based on the fair value of the award at the balance sheet date 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations subsequent to december   we entered into two contracts with third party sellers to acquire two industrial properties consisting of two buildings located in the washington dc baltimore market 
the properties aggregate approximately  square feet for a purchase price of approximately million 
there is no assurance that we will acquire the properties under contract because the proposed acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence  various closing conditions and the consent of the mortgage lender 

table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by period as of december  dollars in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total debt debt interest payments purchase obligations total non gaap financial measures we use the following non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as a key supplemental measure of our operating performance funds from operations  or ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
further  our computation of ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to ffo  ebitda and adjusted ebitda reported by other companies 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that presenting ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient 
as a result  we believe that the use of ffo  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance 
the following table reflects the calculation of ffo reconciled from net loss available to common stockholders for the three months ended december  and and for the year ended december  and for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  dollars in thousands except per share data for the three months ended december  for the year ended december  period from february  commencement of operations to december  net loss available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization non real estate depreciation allocation to participating securities funds from operations basic and diluted ffo per common share weighted average basic and diluted common shares

we compute ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization 
we compute adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  acquisition costs and stock based compensation 
we believe that presenting ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because they are measures of our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of tax  non cash depreciation and amortization expense and acquisition costs and stock based compensation with regard to adjusted ebitda 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda and adjusted ebitda allow investors to measure our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and  therefore  allow for more meaningful comparison of our operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and for the comparison of our operating performance to that of other companies  both in the real estate industry and in other industries 
as we are currently in a growth phase  acquisition costs are excluded from adjusted ebitda to allow for the comparison of our operating performance to that of stabilized companies 
the following table reflects the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda reconciled from net loss available to common stockholders for the three months ended december  and and for the year ended december  and for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  dollars in thousands for the three months ended december  for the year ended december  period from february  commencement of operations to december  net loss available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization interest expense  including amortization ebitda stock based compensation acquisition costs adjusted ebitda includes expensed acquisition costs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk which we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio and operations 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
as described below  some of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates  and we expect that some of our future outstanding debt will have variable interest rates 
we may use interest rate caps to manage our interest rate risks relating to our variable rate debt 
we expect to replace variable rate debt on a regular basis with fixed rate  long term debt to finance our assets and operations 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility and million under our term loan 
amounts borrowed under our credit facility and term loan bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus an applicable libor margin  which interest rate is and as of december   respectively  for the credit facility and term loan 
if the libor rate fluctuates by  interest expense would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows by approximately  annually on the outstanding balances on our credit facility and term loan as of december
