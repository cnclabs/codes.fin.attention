critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is earned from the sale of advertising 
the sale of advertising in print directories is the primary source of revenue 
we recognize revenue from print directory advertising ratably over the life of each directory using the amortization method of accounting  with revenue recognition commencing in the month of publication 
revenue derived from digital advertising is earned primarily from two sources fixed fee and performance based advertising 
fixed fee advertising includes advertisement placement on our and other local search websites  website development and website hosting for client advertisers 
revenue from fixed fee advertisers is recognized ratably over the life of the advertising service 
performance based advertising revenue is earned when consumers connect with client advertisers by a click on their digital advertising or a phone call to their business 
performance based advertising revenue is recognized when there is evidence that qualifying transactions have occurred 
some of our revenue agreements contain multiple deliverables that involve one or more of our advertising media 
revenue from these agreements is allocated to the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method 
in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting in  the fair value of the deferred revenue was determined to be zero 
we did not have remaining performance obligations related to our clients who had previously contracted for advertising  thus  no value was assigned to deferred revenue 
as a result  deferred revenue of approximately million million net of estimated sales allowance was not recognized in our consolidated statement of operations which would have been otherwise recorded by the predecessor company 

table of contents expense recognition costs directly attributable to producing directories are amortized over the average life of a directory under the deferral and amortization method of accounting 
direct costs include paper  printing  initial distribution and sales commissions 
paper costs are stated on an average cost basis 
all other costs are recognized as incurred 
in connection with the company s adoption of fresh start accounting in  the fair value of deferred directory costs was determined to be zero 
the deferred directory costs as of december  did not have future value since the company had already incurred the costs to produce the clients advertising and did not expect to incur additional costs associated with those published directories 
as a result  deferred directory costs of million was not recognized in our consolidated statement of operations which would have been otherwise recorded by the predecessor company 
accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet has accounts receivables of million  which represents receivables of million  including amounts billed to clients but not yet collected and amounts to be billed for services already provided  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
receivables are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated using a percentage of sales method  based upon collection history  and an estimate of uncollectible accounts 
management may exercise judgment in adjusting the provision as a consequence of known items  such as current economic factors and credit trends 
accounts receivable adjustments are recorded against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue for the years  and was  and  respectively 
goodwill the company has goodwill of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in accordance with us gaap  impairment testing for goodwill is performed at least annually unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods 
the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step approach  which is performed at the entity level the reporting unit 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit calculated using the enterprise value market capitalization approach to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed 
step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value ie  the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of the unit s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangible assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the excess is required to be recorded as an impairment 
in september  the company recorded a non cash  goodwill impairment charge of  million million after tax 
for additional information related to goodwill impairment  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  the company determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit  therefore there was no additional impairment of goodwill 
intangible assets the company has intangible assets of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  intangible assets are to be recorded separately from goodwill if they meet certain criteria 
internal use software is capitalized if it has a useful life in excess of one year 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform 
the company s intangible assets and their estimated useful lives are presented in the table below estimated useful lives in years client relationships patented technologies internal use software marketing related indefinite 
table of contents client relationships and patented technologies are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverability analysis includes estimates of future cash flows directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the definite lived intangible asset 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the definite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
internal use software is amortized over a three to seven year period using the straight line method 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed as they are incurred 
marketing related intangible assets  which include trademarks  domain names and trade names are not amortized but are instead tested for impairment 
the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is tested annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the intangible assets carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in the recoverability analysis  the carrying amount of the asset is measured against the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluated its intangible assets based on current economic and business indicators and determined they were not impaired 
pension and other post employment benefits the company provides pension and other post employment benefits to many of our employees 
long term assumptions are developed to determine our employee benefit obligation  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics  and reviews public market data and general economic information 
for additional information related to pension and other post employment benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we determine our discount rate based on a range of factors  including a yield curve comprised of the rates of return on several hundred high quality  fixed income corporate bonds available on the measurement date for the related expected duration for the obligations  prepared by an independent third party 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future return on each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
historical performance is considered for the types of assets in which the plan invests  independent market forecasts and economic and capital market considerations 
the healthcare cost trend rate as of december  was  declining to by for both pre and post age employees and retirees 
a sensitivity analysis of the impact on the expense income recorded for of a one percent change in our assumptions is shown in the table below pension health care and life in millions discount rate expected return on assets health care trend rate income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their tax basis at each year end 
these amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect enacted changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be recovered must be assessed 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable 
in this process  certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to 
table of contents absorb deferred tax assets and taxable income in future years 
judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to future market conditions  changes in laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
for additional information related to income taxes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity
