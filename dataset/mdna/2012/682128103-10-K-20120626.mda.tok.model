item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main products  image sensing devices which we refer to as camerachip image sensors  capture an image electronically and are used in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our camerachip image sensors are manufactured using the complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos fabrication process and are predominantly single chip solutions that integrate several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
we have also integrated our camerachip image sensors with wafer level optics  which we refer to as cameracubechip imaging devices 
our cameracubechip imaging device is a small footprint  total camera solution that we believe will enable the further miniaturization of camera products 
we believe that our highly integrated image sensors and imaging devices enable camera device manufacturers to build high quality camera products that are smaller  less complex  more reliable  more cost effective and more power efficient than cameras using traditional charge coupled devices  or ccds 
current economic environment we operate in a challenging economic environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and in patterns of global trade 
we remain a leader in the development and marketing of image sensing devices based on the cmos fabrication process and have benefited from the growing market demand for and acceptance of this technology 
beginning with the second half of our fiscal  general domestic and global economic conditions were negatively impacted by several factors 
these economic conditions resulted in our facing one of the most challenging periods in our history 
during the latter part of fiscal and throughout fiscal  we saw indications suggesting certain major economies were returning to positive growth 
our quarterly sales improved in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal however  as a result of recent events  it is uncertain whether the resumption of economic growth will be sustained 
given the current economic environment  we remain cautious and we expect our customers to be cautious as well  which could affect our future results 
if the economic recovery slows down or even dissipates  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
market environment we sell our products worldwide directly to oems which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and vars and indirectly through distributors 
in order to ensure that we address all available markets for our image sensors  we organize our marketing efforts into end use market groups  each of which concentrates on a particular product or  in some cases  customers within a product group 
thus  we have marketing teams that address the mobile phone market  the notebook and webcam market  the dsc market  the security and surveillance market  the entertainment market  and the automotive and medical markets 
in the mobile phone market in particular  future revenues depend to a large extent on design wins where  on the basis of an exhaustive evaluation of available products  a particular mobile phone maker 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued determines which image sensor to design into one or more specific models 
the time lag between design win and volume shipments varies from as little as three months to as much as months  which could cause an unexpected delay in generating revenues  especially during periods of product transitions 
design wins are also an important driver in the many other markets that we address  and in some cases  such as automotive or medical applications  the time lag between a particular design win and revenue generation can be longer than one year 
the overwhelming majority of our sales depend on decisions by the engineering designers for manufacturers of products that incorporate image sensors to specify one of our products rather than one made by a competitor 
in most cases  the decision to specify a particular image sensor requires conforming other specifications of the product to the chosen image sensor and makes subsequent changes both difficult and expensive 
accordingly  the ability to timely produce and deliver reliable products in large quantities is a key competitive differentiator 
since our inception  we have shipped more than billion image sensors  including approximately million in fiscal we believe that these quantities demonstrate the continuing capabilities of our production system  including our sources of offshore fabrication 
we outsource the wafer fabrication and packaging of our image sensor products to third parties 
we outsource the color filter and micro lens phases of production to visera  our joint venture with the tsmc 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development  marketing and testing of our products and to significantly reduce our capital requirements 
with our cameracubechip products  we collaborate with the industry s leading wafer level lens suppliers 
to enhance our cameracubechip production capabilities  we acquired from visera in october its cameracubechip production and assembly operations  which we had previously outsourced to them 
to increase and enhance our production capabilities  we work closely with tsmc  our principal wafer supplier and one of the largest wafer fabrication companies in the world  to increase  as necessary  the number of its fabrication facilities at which our products can be produced 
our investments in visera and three other key back end packaging suppliers are part of a broad strategy to ensure that we have sufficient back end capacity for the processing of our image sensors in the various formats required by our customers 
we currently perform the final testing of the majority of our products at our own facility in china 
as necessary  we will make further investments to expand our testing and production capacity  as well as our overall capability to design additional custom products for our customers 
since our customers end user customers market and sell their products worldwide  our revenues by geographic location are not necessarily indicative of the geographic distribution of end user sales  but rather indicate where the products and or their components are manufactured or sourced 
the revenues we report by geography are based on the country or region in which our customers issue their purchase orders to us 
many of the products using our image sensors  such as mobile phones  notebooks  tablets  webcams  dscs and cameras for entertainment applications  are consumer electronics goods 
these mass market camera devices generally have seasonal cycles which historically have caused the sales of our customers to fluctuate quarter to quarter 
in addition  since a very large number of the manufacturers who use our products are located in china and taiwan  the pattern of demand for our image sensors has been increasingly influenced by the timing of the extended lunar or chinese new year holiday  a period in which the factories which use our image sensors generally close 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued consequently  demand for our image sensors has historically been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
due to the global economic downturn in  we experienced weaker than normal conditions in all of our markets in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal with the return to profitability in our business beginning in the second fiscal quarter of  and throughout fiscal  it appeared that the historical seasonal cycle had resumed its influence on our business 
however  as a result of recent macroeconomic uncertainties  some schedule delays in our product introductions and unexpected cutbacks in order from certain of our key customers  our historical seasonal cycle was disrupted again 
the unexpected cutbacks in orders were principally related to some of our customers key end user customers adjusting down the demand forecast for some of their key consumer oriented products  that we believe were due to volatile market conditions and the global economic environment 
this downward adjustment in demand forecast caused some of our customers to scale back their orders for components such as image sensors 
if we continue to experience economic uncertainties  product delays  order cutbacks or similar events in the future  our financial results may not be consistent with our historical seasonal cycles 
while we believe that the market opportunities represented by mobile phones remain very large  the opportunities presented could be deferred because of the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the current global economic recovery 
we believe that  like the demand for dscs  mobile phone  notebook  tablet and webcam demand will not only continue to shift toward higher resolutions  but also will increasingly fragment into multiple market segments with differing product attributes 
for example  we see the further expansion of the smartphone segment within the mobile phone market 
in addition  there is increased demand for customization  and several different interface standards are coming to maturity 
all of these trends will require the development of broader variety of products 
as the markets for image sensors have grown  we have experienced competition from manufacturers of cmos and ccd image sensors 
our principal competitors in the market for cmos image sensors include aptina imaging  samsung  sharp  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba 
we expect to see continued price competition in the image sensor market for mobile phones  notebooks and webcams  security and surveillance systems  dscs  and video cameras  entertainment devices  automotive and medical imaging systems as those markets continue to grow 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively in those markets  our competitive position could be impaired by companies that have greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing and distribution resources  broader product lines  better access to large customer bases  greater name recognition  longer operating histories and more established strategic and financial relationships than we do 
such companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
many of these competitors own and operate their own fabrication facilities  which in certain circumstances may give them the ability to price their products more aggressively than we can or may allow them to respond more rapidly than we can to changing market opportunities 
in addition  from time to time  other companies enter the cmos image sensor market by using obsolete and available manufacturing equipment 
while these efforts have rarely had any long term success  the new entrants do sometimes manage to gain market share in the short term by pricing their products significantly below current market levels which puts additional downward pressure on the prices we can obtain for our products 
in common with many other semiconductor products and as a response to competitive pressures  the average selling prices  or asps of image sensor products have declined steadily since their 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued introduction  and we expect asps to continue to decline in the future 
some of this asp decline may be offset by the adoption of some of our newer and higher resolution products 
we have also started to ship our cameracubechip products  which carry a higher asp because of the added value from the attachment of wafer level optics to our image sensors 
depending on the adoption rate and unit volume  we believe these products may also mitigate the rate of asp decline 
in order to maintain or grow our revenues  we need to increase the number of units we sell by a large enough amount to offset the effect of declining asps 
separately  in order to maintain our gross margins  we and our suppliers must work continuously to lower our manufacturing costs and increase our production yields 
recently  we also required our suppliers to invest in additional equipment and such investment translates into higher product costs 
if we are unable to spread such added cost over larger unit sales  our gross margin may decline 
in addition  if we are unable to timely develop and introduce new products that can take advantage of smaller process geometries or new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher asps  our gross margin may decline 
having the ability to forecast customer demand correctly and to prepare the appropriate level of inventory to meet this demand is also important in the semiconductor industry 
in fiscal  the entire semiconductor industry  including us  experienced supply constraints 
due to supply constraints  semiconductor companies were unable to meet the product demands of their customers and to take certain actions such as allocating available products among their customers or  in some cases  increasing the prices of their products 
this resulted in harm to customer relations  the loss of sales to customers and  in some cases  the loss of future business with those customers 
we faced these same challenges as we sought to meet our customers demand for our products 
despite these challenges  through careful strategic planning relating to our products and the technologies that we delivered to market  we were able to achieve revenue growth and unit growth 
if supply constraints were to happen again and we were unable to manage our products appropriately  we may be unable to achieve future sales growth  which could result in our revenues  gross margins and other financial results being materially and adversely affected 
conversely  an excess in inventory supply can also adversely affect our performance 
during the second quarter of fiscal  certain of our key customers unexpectedly cutback their orders 
in addition to reducing our unit sales of our omnibsi and omnipixel hs based products and adversely affecting our revenues for the second and third quarters of fiscal  the cutback also resulted in our inventories at the end of the second and third quarters of fiscal being higher than we intended them to be 
the unexpected cutbacks in orders were principally related to some of our customers key end user customers adjusting down the demand forecast for some of their key consumer oriented products  that we believe were due to volatile market conditions and the global economic environment 
this downward adjustment in demand forecast caused some of our customers to scale back their orders for components such as image sensors 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our omnibsi inventories increased significantly 
since our production capacity ramp is slower than our customers production ramp schedule  we must build inventory to ensure we can meet our obligations to customers 
however  since customer demand can be volatile  we may be unable to sell inventories that were built in excess of demand  or we may have to sell at lower prices to eliminate excess inventories 
under such circumstances  we may be required to record significant provisions for excess and obsolete inventories 
this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect the business environment to remain volatile throughout the fiscal  especially in the consumer oriented product markets  and will continue to affect our ability to accurately forecast customer demand 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued given the rapidly changing nature of our technology  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter delays or other unexpected production yield issues with future products 
in general  during the early stages of production  production yields and gross margins for new products are typically lower than those of established products 
during production  we can also encounter unexpected manufacturing issues  such as unexpected back end yield problems 
in addition  in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products 
due to our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products 
given the current economic uncertainty  the visibility of our business outlook is extremely limited and forecasting is even more difficult than under normal market conditions 
as a result  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages of certain products and build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
we carefully consider the risk that our inventories may be in excess of expected future demand and record appropriate reserves 
if  as sometimes happens  we are subsequently able to sell these reserved products  the sales have little or no associated cost and consequently  they have a favorable impact on gross margins 
strategy our strategic goal is to provide and deliver improved image centric technologies and solutions to our customers  and to develop and make available a full range of innovative and cross functional imaging products to all the markets 
the most important elements of our strategy are the following maintain technology leadership 
we intend to maintain our position as a leader in cmos image sensor technology by continuing to develop our expertise in mixed signal implementation  advanced pixel design  feature integration  and manufacturing processes and controls  including automated testing 
our image sensor integrates both the image sensor and the signal processor into a single chip  often eliminating the requirement for a separate dsp 
as a result  our camerachip image sensors offer camera device manufacturers advantages in terms of size  power consumption  cost and ease of design 
for example  in may  we announced our omnibsi architecture  which is the enabling technology behind our current m pixel 
in february  we announced our omnibsi architecture  which forms the basis of our even smaller and more advanced m pixel 
we are continuing to develop products using still narrower geometries 
we have successfully developed image sensor technology from  pixels to megapixels  underscoring our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions to address changing market demands 
we are committed to improving image quality and to reducing the overall size of the image sensor s array 
the omnibsi  omnibsi and omnibsi architectures are based on bsi technology 
all traditionally designed cmos image sensors capture light on the front side of the chip  so the photo sensitive portion has to share the surface of the sensor with the metal wiring of the transistors in the pixel 
with our omnibsi  omnibsi and omnibsi architectures  the sensor receives light through the back side of the chip 
not only does this enable us to produce a superior image  it also permits the front of chip surface area to be devoted entirely to processing  and permits an increase in the number of metal layers  both of which result in greater functionality 
another advantage of capturing light on the back side of the image sensor is that we reduce the distance the light has to travel to the pixels  and thus provide a wider angle of light acceptance 
widening the angle of light acceptance in turn makes it possible to reduce the height of the camera module  and thus the height of the device which incorporates the camera module 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our introduction of wafer level optics to our product offerings is another example of our intention to continue to develop new and innovative technologies 
our cameracubechip technology is a three dimensional  reflowable  total camera solution that combines the full functionality of our image sensors with wafer level optics in one compact  small footprint package 
our commitment to maintaining our technology leadership is also reflected in our acquisition of a cmos sensor patent portfolio from kodak in march we effectively doubled the size of our patent portfolio 
as of april   we have been issued united states patents and foreign patents 
as of april   we have additional united states patent applications pending  of which have been allowed  and we have foreign patent applications pending  of which have been allowed 
leverage expertise across multiple mass market applications 
we intend to continue to focus on developing our image sensors for multiple mass market applications 
to date we have shipped more than billion image sensors 
as the demand for camera functionality increases in our principal markets and becomes a standard feature in a wider variety of consumer  commercial and industrial applications  we expect that additional markets will emerge 
in the past  we have leveraged our expertise in certain of our target markets to expand into emerging mass market applications for our image sensors 
for example  we used the expertise we developed in mobile phone markets to develop image sensors for notebook computers 
other markets and applications we are focusing on include security and surveillance  entertainment devices  and the multiple opportunities in automotive and medical applications 
increase our market presence 
we intend to increase our visibility and penetration into new product designs by collaborating with oems  vars and distributors and by entering into partnerships with other companies that offer complementary and supporting technologies 
in certain instances we will provide design services to our contract manufacturing partners  enabling them to increase their overall value added through the production of highly tailored end products  which we believe will increase the likelihood that they will recommend the use of our products to branded manufacturers 
in addition  we will partner with companies that offer complementary and supporting technologies to integrate our products with theirs for use in the reference designs that they promote to manufacturers 
as a result  we believe that we are able to provide our customers with valuable design and marketing references 
we also see a developing trend for video centric applications in the consumer markets 
consequently  we acquired aurora and its advanced image projection technology  which we believe we can leverage to offer innovative and comprehensive imaging solutions to oems as they design their next generation products 
further develop close customer relationships 
we intend to enhance our customer relationships by continuing to collaborate with our customers on the design and specification of their products 
we work with customers during various stages of their product development cycles  including strategic decision making  new product design and replacement design to help them develop a logical technology migration path and to ensure that our products meet their future design needs 
by working closely with our customers  we believe we can better anticipate their future design needs and increase the likelihood that they will incorporate our image sensors into their products 
our solution we specifically design our highly integrated image sensors to be cost effective and to provide high image quality 
by integrating a number of distinct functions onto a single cmos chip  including image 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of images for either digital or analog equipment  our image sensors offer camera device manufacturers a number of benefits  including high image quality and resolution 
we have developed a number of proprietary methods for enhancing image quality by increasing our image sensors sensitivity to light and significantly improving their signal to noise ratio 
these methods allow us to reduce the size of each individual pixel and thereby increase the number of pixels in an image sensor of a given size 
the result is a current portfolio of several high resolution image sensors ranging up to a megapixel product 
in addition  we are able to produce image sensors at lower resolutions with smaller pixel arrays  which serve to reduce the overall cost of the image sensor and its supporting components  such as lenses 
lower cost 
the highly integrated design of our image sensors enables us to deliver image sensors to our customers at a cost which makes the cameras they are part of increasingly less expensive 
this cost saving is driven  in large part  by our ability to achieve a high level of functionality in a single chip while continually reducing the overall size of the device 
similarly  we believe our cameracubechip imaging devices  as compact total camera solutions that can be reflowed onto circuit boards directly  can streamline the camera device manufacturers process  yielding further cost savings to our customers 
accelerated time to market 
the highly integrated nature of our image sensors simplifies the design of cameras and allows our customers to shorten their product design cycles 
we believe our cameracubechip devices further shorten the design cycle by offering a complete imaging solution from the very beginning 
these factors provide our mobile phone and consumer electronics customers with critical competitive advantages  as time to market is typically a major determinant of product success and longevity 
we also work closely with our customers to accelerate product development cycles by providing camera reference designs  engineering design review services and customer product evaluation  testing and debugging services 
in addition  we have designed our manufacturing and production processes to allow us to quickly ramp production volumes to meet increased customer demand  which is particularly important in the high volume markets in which we participate 
streamlined manufacturing and production 
our image sensors are well suited for production using the relatively simple  low cost and large scale wafer fabrication processes developed for other semiconductor products that use the cmos process 
we work closely with our foundry partners and with all the other providers of the manufacturing services we require to produce our final products to refine their processes in order to optimize our image sensor performance and yields 
ease of use 
our single chip cmos design generates video outputs in industry standard formats directly from the chip 
these formats include the national television system committee  or ntsc  format and or the phase alternating line  or pal  format for analog video 
for digital video  our sensors generate unprocessed data called rgb and or a standard signal color encoding system known as yuv 
as a result  our image sensors can be quickly and easily integrated into products targeted at numerous markets 
capital resources as of april   we held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments 
to mitigate market risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy designed to preserve the value of capital and to generate interest income from these investments without material exposure to market fluctuations 
market risk is 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates or bond prices  and changes in market liquidity and in the pricing of risk 
our policy is to invest in financial instruments with short maturities  limiting interest rate exposure  and to measure performance against comparable benchmarks 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
we do not believe that the value of our cash and short term investments will be significantly affected by current instability in the global financial markets 
on november   we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock  effective immediately 
the exact amount  method and timing of any purchases under the stock repurchase program will be subject to market conditions  legal requirements  management s judgment  as well as other factors 
the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of stock and purchases under the program may be commenced or suspended at any time  or from time to time  without prior notice 
our board of directors may modify  extend or terminate the stock repurchase program at any time 
as of april   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock under this program  for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
see note common stock and treasury stock to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues we generate almost all our revenues by selling our products directly to oems and vars and indirectly through distributors 
for accounting purposes  we treat sales to oems and vars as one source of revenue  and sales to distributors as another and our revenue recognition policies for the two groups are different 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below for additional information regarding recognition of revenue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  stock based compensation  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates reflect the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition for shipments to customers without agreements that allow for returns or credits  principally oems and vars  we recognize revenue using the sell in method 
under this method  we recognize revenue when title passes to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  collection of resulting receivables is considered reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining material obligations 
we provide for future returns of potentially defective products based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
for cash consideration given to customers that is primarily in the form of rebates  and for which we do not receive a separately identifiable benefit or cannot reasonably estimate fair value  we record the amounts as reductions of revenue 
for shipment of products sold to distributors under agreements allowing for returns or credits  title and the risk of ownership to the products transfer to the distributor upon shipment  and the distributor is obligated to pay for the products whether or not the distributor has sold them at the time payment is due 
under the terms of our agreements with such distributors and subject to our prior approval  distributors are entitled to reclaim from us as price adjustments the difference  if any  between the prices at which we sold the product to the distributors and the prices at which the product is subsequently sold by the distributor 
in addition  distributors have limited rights to return inventory that they determine is in excess of their requirements  and accordingly  in determining the appropriate level of provision for excess and obsolete inventory  we take into account the inventories held by our distributors 
for these reasons  prices and revenues are not fixed or determinable until the distributor resells the products to our end user customers and the distributor notifies us in writing of the details of such sales transactions 
accordingly  we recognize revenue using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  we defer the revenue  adjustments to revenue and the related costs of revenue until the final resale of such products to end customers 
the amounts billed to these distributors and adjustments to revenue and the cost of inventory shipped to  but not yet sold by  the distributors are shown net on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenues  less cost of revenues 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured or upon receipt of payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we undertake credit evaluations for all major sale transactions before we release product for shipment 
normal payment terms apply upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide allowances for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectability and may require additional allowances  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately and  respectively  of total accounts receivable 
allowance for sales returns and warranties based on historical sales returns and other known factors  we provide for estimated sales returns in the same period we record the related revenues 
to estimate our allowance for sales returns  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the allowance are recorded as a reduction to net revenues 
because the allowance for sales returns is based 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our allowances may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our allowances are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
we warrant to our customers that our products will work in accordance with each product s specifications 
due to the cost and other complexities associated with rectifying any product defects  we do not repair any defective products 
if a product is defective  the customer notifies us and  with our approval  returns the defective product 
we then send replacement products to the customer 
accordingly  we account for any exposure related to defective products as a portion of our allowance for sales returns 
the net change in our allowance for sales returns balance in fiscal was approximately of revenues  and the allowance was approximately of total accounts receivable at april  excess and obsolete inventory and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our forecast of future demand for our products 
we record provisions for the cost of inventories when the number of units on hand exceeds the number of units that we forecast will be sold over a certain period of time  generally months 
when we recognize the provisions  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we may subsequently sell some of these excess and obsolete inventories 
even though we may sell these products at a price that was less than our original cost  sales of these products improve our current period gross margins because the inventory was previously written down 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand at the end of each fiscal quarter 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will record a provision  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products  while preparing for production of newer products 
given our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products or the projected life cycles of new products which have continued to shorten in duration 
under these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages of certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
stock based compensation expense the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective measurement date fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payment awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including our stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we use an average between the historical volatility of our common stock  and the implied volatility of traded options on our common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding our employees 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  authoritative guidance for stock based compensation also requires the recording of expense that is net of an anticipated forfeiture rate 
only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we will revise the rate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
we elected to use the long form method to establish the beginning balance of  and to determine the subsequent impact on  the additional paid in capital pool 
for the tax effects of share based payment awards  we use the with and without approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized 
as a result  we will recognize a tax benefit from stock based awards in additional paid in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we account for the indirect effects of stock based awards on other tax attributes  such as research and development tax credits  through the consolidated statements of operations 
in september  our stockholders approved the equity incentive plan  or the plan 
see note employee stock purchase  equity incentive and stock option plans to our consolidated financial statements 
the plan allows the grant of  among other things  performance share awards to employees 
under the authoritative guidance for stock based compensation  when we record the stock based compensation expense for such awards that carry performance contingencies  we have to estimate the probable outcome at the end of the performance period 
furthermore  we have to adjust the cumulative compensation expense recorded when probable outcome for the performance based shares is subsequently updated for changes in facts and circumstances 
valuation of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and prepaid wafer credits  may not be recoverable  we assess whether the value of such asset or asset group has been impaired 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
if such events occur  we would estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would recognize an impairment loss 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of financial instruments the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based upon whether the inputs to those valuation techniques reflect assumptions other market participants would use based upon market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs or reflect our own assumption of market participant valuation unobservable inputs 
we use inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  broker dealer quotes and other similar data from independent sources to determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities 
for quoted prices from active markets  we do not make any material adjustments 
for quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other observable and market corroborated inputs  we review the inputs for reasonableness  and may further adjust the fair value based on market indices or other information that management deems material to the fair value estimates 
as of april   the fair value of our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included million of assets  and million of liabilities 
of the million of assets  million were classified as level  most of which were investments in money market funds 
the remaining million of investments were classified as level  representing investments in debt securities issued by the us government and its agencies  other corporate securities and our equity investment in tong hsing 
the million of liabilities were classified as level  and consisted of interest rate swaps that we entered into in conjunction with a mortgage loan in fiscal and a term loan in fiscal the fair value of the interest rate swaps included the effect of our credit risk 
we did not classify any financial instruments as level under the fair value hierarchy 
accounting for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes  we make certain estimates and judgments in determining the income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may increase or decrease our tax provision in a subsequent period 
similarly  for tax liabilities denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  changes in the value of the denominated currency will increase or decrease our tax provision in a subsequent period 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the assessment of uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
in the first step  recognition  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criterion 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
because we are required to determine the probability of various possible outcomes  such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this re evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  and changes in tax law 
a change in recognition or measurement would result either in the recognition of a tax benefit or in an additional charge to the tax provision for the period 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we also have to assess the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if realization is not likely  we are required to increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate we will not ultimately realize 
we believe that we will ultimately realize a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that it is more likely than not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of april   we have recorded a valuation allowance of million primarily to offset california research and development tax credit carryovers 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these carryovers 
in the future  if the credit is utilized and the valuation allowance is released  the release of valuation allowance will be accounted for as a reduction of the income tax expense in the period such event occurs 
for fiscal  and  our income tax provision reflected effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
these rates are less than the combined us federal and state statutory rate of approximately principally because we earn a portion of our profits in jurisdictions where tax rates are lower than the combined us federal and state statutory rate 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
given the uncertainties associated with litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a probable loss or probable range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results we can expect for any future period

revenues decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in unit sales of our image sensor products  reflecting decreased unit shipments into the mobile phone and the notebook markets  and was partially offset by an increase in unit shipments into the entertainment market 
the decrease in unit shipment in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was principally attributable to a reduction in shipment of low resolution sensors  driven by the emergence of low cost competitors that supplied image sensors to entry level mobile phone and notebook manufacturers 
in addition  we experienced significant order cutbacks from our key customers in our second and third quarters of fiscal  when some of our customers key end user customers adjusted the demand forecast for some of their key consumer oriented products  based on volatile market conditions and global economic environment 
this reduction in orders also contributed to the decreased unit shipments 
this was partially offset by a increase in our asps from fiscal  which was attributable to a proportionately higher quantity of megapixel hd products shipped 
the increase in revenues in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to a increase in unit sales of our image sensor products  reflecting a continuing recovery in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product demand from the prior year period and improvements in our product mix  which resulted in a increase in asps 
revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our image sensor products either directly to oems and vars or indirectly through distributors 
the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars was higher in fiscal than in fiscal and fiscal we expect that the percentage of revenues from sales through oems and vars will vary from year to year in response to changes in the composition of our customer list  and that it may continue to represent a majority of our revenues 
the gross margins that we earn on sales to oems and vars or through distributors are not significantly different 
the following table shows the percentages of revenues from sales to oems and vars and distributors for the periods indicated year ended april  oems and vars distributors total oems and vars

revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table shows the percentages of our revenues derived from sales of our image sensor products to domestic customers  as compared to foreign customers for the periods indicated year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total we derive the majority of our foreign sales from customers in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
our sales to asia pacific customers remain significant primarily due to the continuing trend of outsourcing the production of consumer electronics products to asia pacific manufacturers and facilities and as a result of the increasing markets in asia for consumer products 
the revenues we report by geography are based on the country or region in which our customers issue their purchase orders to us 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because of the preponderance of asia pacific manufacturers and the fact that virtually all products incorporating our image sensor products are sold globally  we believe that the geographic distribution of our sales does not accurately reflect the geographic distribution of sales into end user markets of products which incorporate our image sensors 
over time  our domestic and foreign sales mix may fluctuate as a result of changes in the composition of our customer list that we experience in our business 
gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal our gross margin in fiscal was  a decrease from for fiscal the principal contributor to the year over year decrease in gross margin included the sale of inventory during the second half of the fiscal year that carried higher manufacturing costs than our products sold in fiscal  due to unfavorable production yields experienced by these inventory items when we introduced and manufactured them during the first half of fiscal  the cost of owning the cameracubechip production operations was reflected in our cost of revenues since october   and a million decrease in sales from previously written down products  which totaled million  as compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
these were partially offset by an increase in shipment of our premium vga products  which carried higher gross margin  and a decrease in the write down of inventories which totaled approximately million  as compared to million during the prior fiscal year 
we expect that our gross margins will remain at a depressed level for at least the first quarter of fiscal  due to the anticipated change in product mix to include a higher volume of our new omnibsi products 
these products will have higher production costs when compared to our older products because of additional assembly and manufacture costs incurred by our supply chain vendors in connection with capacity expansion 
we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation expense to cost of revenues in fiscal  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance on how comprehensive income is presented 
the new guidance gives companies two choices of how to present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income companies can create one continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate consecutive statements 
the presentation of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity is not allowed 
in december  the fasb modified the authoritative guidance by deferring until further notice the requirement of presenting the effects of reclassification adjustments on accumulated other comprehensive income as both components of net income and of other comprehensive income 
the guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb revised the authoritative guidance on how companies should test goodwill for impairment 
the revised guidance allows a company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  before determining whether it is necessary to perform additional goodwill impairment tests 
the guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  with an option for early adoption starting in the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

although we transact the overwhelming majority of our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products and thus may impact our results of operations 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  from time to time  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit issued by banks  commercial paper  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
we do not believe that the recent instability in global financial markets has significantly affected the value of our cash and short term investments 
during fiscal  we financed the purchase of the santa clara property with a million mortgage loan 
the mortgage loan is a variable rate loan which bears interest at libor plus basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued points and changes in the interest rate affect our interest payments 
however  concurrent with the mortgage loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount that approximates the principal outstanding under the mortgage loan 
we are the fixed rate payer under the swap with a fixed rate of 
by july  we drew down the total available amount of million under a related term loan 
concurrent with the term loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount that approximates the principal outstanding under the term loan 
we are the fixed rate payer under the swap with a fixed rate of 
consequently  although we are required to mark the value of the swaps to market at each balance sheet date and record the associated non cash cost or benefit as part of other income  net  a hypothetical change in libor would not have a material effect on our interest expense for fiscal as to the construction loan  the interest rate is based on an indicative rate as published by the chinese government  and will be adjusted every september to the then current published rate 
interest rate under the construction loan was at april  we do not hedge against the risk of interest rate changes for the construction loan 
however  since the current interest rate is published by the chinese government and will not be adjusted until september  any hypothetical shifts in yield will not cause a significant adverse impact to our results of operations  cash flows or to our financial position for fiscal
