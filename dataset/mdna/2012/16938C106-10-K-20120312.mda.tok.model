the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains certain forward looking information 
see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements 
our financial statements are prepared in us dollars and in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company  through our indirect majority owned prc subsidiaries  shandong taibang and guizhou taibang  and our minority owned prc investee  huitian  principally engaged in the research  development  manufacturing and sales of plasma based pharmaceutical products in china 
shandong taibang operates from our manufacturing facility located in tai an  shandong province and guizhou taibang operates from our manufacturing facility located in guiyang city  guizhou province 
our minority owned investee  huitian  operates from its facility in shaanxi province 
the plasma based biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry in china is highly regulated by both provincial and central governments 
accordingly  the manufacturing process of our products is strictly monitored from the initial collection of plasma from human donors to finished products 
our principal products include our approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products 
we are approved to sell human albumin with dosages of ml  ml  ml  ml  ml  ml and ml 
human albumin is our top selling product 
sales of these human albumin products represented approximately  and of our total sales  respectively  for each of the years ended december   and human albumin is principally used to increase blood volume while immunoglobulin  one of our other major products  is used for certain disease prevention and cures 
our approved human albumin and immunoglobulin products use human plasma as the basic raw material 
albumin has been used for almost years to treat critically ill patients by replacing lost fluid and maintaining adequate blood volume and pressure 
all of our products are prescription medicines administered in the form of injections 
we sell our products to customers in the prc  mainly hospitals and inoculation centers directly or through approved distributors 
we usually sign short term contracts with customers and therefore our largest customers have changed over the years 
for the years ended december   and  our top customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total sales 
as we continue to diversify our geographic presence  customer base and product mix  we expect that our largest customers will continue to change from year to year 
we operate and manage our business as a single segment 
we do not account for the results of our operations on a geographic or other basis 
financial performance highlights the following are some financial highlights for the fiscal year ended december  sales sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased by to for from for income from operations income from operations decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  net income attributable to company net income attributable to company decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  fully diluted net income per share fully diluted net income per share was for the year ended december   as compared for the year ended december  closure of plasma stations in guizhou province on july   the guizhou provincial health department issued the revised plan for guizhou provincial blood collection institutional setting  or the guizhou plan  which limits the number of counties that are permitted to set up plasma collection stations in guizhou province to four counties 
as a result of the implementation of the guizhou plan  the licenses of four active plasma collection stations in dan zhai  wei ning  san sui and na yong counties owned by guizhou taibang were not renewed after their respective plasma collection permits expired at the end of july the licenses of its plasma collection stations in pu ding and huang ping counties locations permitted under the guizhou plan were renewed until july  these four stations in dan zhai  wei ning  san sui and na yong counties together accounted for approximately months of operation and of our total plasma collection by volume for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  guizhou taibang s inactive plasma collection station in guizhou province that was purchased from the government in is unlikely to be licensed as planned  because it is in zhengyuan county  a location not included in the guizhou plan 
as a result of the closure of the above plasma collection stations  certain equipment  office furniture  building improvement and plasma collection permits were abandoned and written off during the third quarter of the loss on abandonment and written off of these long lived assets is set forth below 
equipment  office furniture  building improvement  plasma collection permits  total  furthermore  we wrote off  of raw material plasma that is expected not to qualify for production due to the day quarantine period rules as their sourcing plasma stations were closed under the guizhou plan 
principal factors affecting our financial performance the following are key factors that affect our financial condition and results of operations and we believe them to be important to the understanding of our business raw material supply and prices the primary raw material used in the production of our albumin and immunoglobulin products is human plasma 
collection of human plasma in china is regulated and until  only licensed plasmapheresis stations owned and operated by the government could collect human plasma 
each collection station was only allowed to supply plasma to the one manufacturer that has signed the quality responsibility statement with them 
the price of human plasma is negotiated on an annual basis and is determined by a number of factors including  but not limited to  the cost of operating the collection stations  the nutritional supplement fee awarded to the donors for each donation  and the anticipated volume of total plasma donated 
however  in march  the ministry of health promulgated certain measures on reforming plasma collection stations  or the blood collection measures  whereby the ownership and management of prc plasma stations are required to be transferred to plasma based biopharmaceutical companies while the regulatory supervision and administrative control remain with the state 
plasma stations that did not complete their reform by december   risked revocation of their license to collect plasma 
in december  we acquired five of the six then existing plasma stations in shandong and on january  we obtained the permits to operate these stations 
these acquisitions have allowed us to have a direct influence on the operation of these collection stations and secure a stable source of plasma supply for production 
the foregoing acquisitions  as well as the acquisition of dalin and its indirectly owned plasma stations  have led to an increase in our plasma supply for production and did not result in any material differences in our cost structure 
due to current market conditions  we have generally been able to pass substantially all cost increases in recent years on to our customers 
prices of and demand for our products the demand for our products is largely affected by the general economic conditions in china because they are still not affordable to many patients 
as china s economy grows  we expect more chinese people will become consumers of medical treatments and procedures  including procedures requiring human plasma 
a significant improvement in the economic environment in china will likely improve consumer income which in turn would make our products more affordable and consequently increase the demand for our products 
we have been able to expand our product range and markets by introducing new products required by customers 
we believe that our technical expertise is important in introducing products that are in demand 
production capacity our sales volume is limited by our annual production capacity 
as we grow our business in the future  our ability to fulfill additional and larger orders will depend on our ability to increase our production capacity 
our plan to expand our production capacity will depend on  inter alia  the availability of capital to meet our needs of expansion or upgrading of production lines  and the availability of stable plasma supply 
as of december   the aggregate production capacity of shandong taibang and guizhou taibang was  metric tons per annum 
we estimate that the production capacity of our major competitors ranges from tons to  tons per annum 
we believe that our current production capacity is sufficient to meet the current demand for our products for the next two years 
competition we are subject to intense competition 
there are both local and overseas pharmaceutical enterprises that are engaged in the manufacture and sale of potential substitute or similar biopharmaceutical products as our products in the prc 
these competitors may have more capital  better research and development resources  manufacturing and marketing capability and experience than we do 
in our industry  we compete based upon product quality  product cost  ability to produce a diverse range of products and logistical capabilities 
we believe that we have strengthened our position in the marketplace with our acquisition of dalin and its majority owned operating subsidiary  guizhou taibang  and a equity interest in huitian  a xi an based biopharmaceutical company 
our profitability may be adversely affected if i competition intensifies  ii competitors drastically reduce prices  iii prc government s interference on prices  or iv competitors develop new products or product substitutes with comparable medicinal applications or therapeutic effects which are more effective or less costly than those produced by us 
please refer to item  business competition for more information regarding this factor

results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  and the following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for fiscal years ended december  and year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease sales external customers related party total sales cost of sales external customers related party total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling expenses general and administrative expenses research and development expenses impairment loss of goodwill loss on abandonment and write off of long lived assets total operating expenses income from operations other income expenses equity in income of equity method investee change in fair value of derivative liabilities interest expense interest income other expenses income  net total other income expenses  net earnings before income tax expense income tax expenses net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to company sales 
our total sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in sales during was primarily attributable to a mix of price and volume increases in certain of our plasma based products 
in addition  foreign exchange translation accounted for of the sales increase 
most of our approved products recorded price increases ranging from approximately to  except for human tetanus immunoglobulin products  which decreased by approximately 
for as compared to  the average price for our approved human albumin products  which contributed to our total sales  increased by approximately and  excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term decreased by approximately  the average price for our approved human hepatitis b immunoglobulin products  which contributed to our total sales  increased by approximately and  excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term decreased slightly by approximately  the average price for our approved human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection  or ivig products  which contributed to our total sales  increased by approximately  and excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term increased by approximately  the average price for our approved human rabies immunoglobulin products  which contributed to our total sales  increased by approximately and  excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term increased by approximately  and the average price for our approved human tetanus immunoglobulin products  which contributed to our total sales  decreased by approximately and  excluding the foreign exchange translation effect  their average price in rmb term decreased by approximately 
the general price increase of our immunoglobulin product group was primarily attributable to the continuing shortage in supply of such products  while the average price decrease in human albumin products in rmb term was mainly due to the continuous increase in the imported volume of this product during the slight price decrease in human hepatitis b immunoglobulin products in rmb term was mainly due to our participation in a public health program sponsored by prc s ministry of health benefiting migrant workers 
the sales price of this public health program is lower than normal retail price in order to benefit migrant workers 
the price decrease in human tetanus immunoglobulin products was primarily the result of the increasingly saturated market 
volume in sales for our human albumin and human tetanus immunoglobulin products increased by and  respectively  for as compared to volume in sales for our ivig  human hepatitis b immunoglobulin and human rabies immunoglobulin products decreased by  and  respectively  for as compared to as the hand foot and mouth disease  or hfmd  which the outburst took place between april and august in  was not as severe in as in  the sales volume of ivig decreased slightly during as compared to the sales volume of human hepatitis b immunoglobulin products decreased mainly due to the decrease in demand as the new government program emphasizes on application of the products on new borns but not the pre natal mothers 
the sales volume decrease in human rabies immunoglobulin products was mainly due to the lack of availability of qualified raw material supply for hyper immune immunoglobulin products 
we will continue to balance the supply of raw material and the demand of the finished products for hyper immune immunoglobulin products 
cost of sales 
our total cost of sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  cost of sales as a percentage of total sales was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales  as well as the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales  was mainly due to the increase in sales and the increase in cost of plasma paid to donors along with a change in the mix of products that were sold during in an effort to increase plasma collection volume and expand our donor base  we increased the nutrition fees paid to donors 
gross profit and gross margin 
our gross profit increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of total sales  our gross margin decreased by to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the price decreases in certain of our products and higher raw material costs as discussed above  which outpaced the price increases of our other products 
operating expenses 
our total operating expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a goodwill impairment loss of  a loss on abandonment of long lived assets of  as well as a increase in our selling expenses and a increase in our general and administrative expenses during as a percentage of total sales  total expenses increased by to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  excluding the non cash charge for impairment of goodwill and loss on abandonment of long lived asset  the total operating expenses was  an increase of  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  selling expenses 
for the year ended december   our selling expenses increased to  from  for the year ended december   an increase of  or 
as a percentage of total sales  our selling expenses for the year ended december  increased by  to  from for the year ended december  the increase in selling expenses was primarily due to our increased promotional and conference activities as we continued our efforts in expanding our customer base into hospitals and inoculation centers throughout the prc 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   our general and administrative expenses increased to  from  for the year ended december   a  or increase 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales increased by to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly due to an increase in expenses related to payroll and employee benefits  as well as an increase of approximately million in non cash employee stock compensation  which is offset by the million decrease in legal expenses 
the increase in payroll was mainly due to general salary increases in the operating subsidiaries and the addition of our new corporate offices in beijing 
research and development expenses 
for the years ended december  and  our research and development expenses were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
as a percentage of total sales  our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the increased cost of plasma used in research and the cost in applying for the sfda approval of our two new products 
due to the delay of the sfda approval process  we expect to receive the approval for these two new products in early impairment loss of goodwill 
following the closure of plasma collection stations of guizhou taibang due to the regulatory notice  we revised our earnings guidance for the year of and experienced incremental decline in our stock price and market capitalization in the third quarter of the occurrence of these events caused us to believe that the fair value of our reporting unit would more likely than not be below its book value 
therefore  we performed a two step goodwill impairment test and concluded that  for the year ended december   a goodwill impairment loss of  was recognized in our single reporting unit since the carrying amount of the reporting unit was greater than the fair value of the reporting unit as determined based on the quoted market price and the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill 
loss on abandonment and write off of long lived assets 
as a result of the closure of the plasma collection stations of guizhou taibang  certain equipment  office furniture  building improvement and plasma collection permits were abandoned or written off during the third quarter of loss on abandonment of guizhou taibang s long lived assets of  was recognized in the year ended december  change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
the embedded derivatives including the conversion option in our senior secured convertible notes and warrants that were issued in june are classified as derivative liabilities carried at fair value 
for the year ended december   we recognized a gain from the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities in the amount of  as compared to a loss in the amount of  for the year ended december  the gain from the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities in is mainly due to a decrease in the price of our common stock from per share as of december  to per share as of december  the convertible notes have been fully converted as of december  future changes in the market price of our common stock could cause the fair value of the warrants to change significantly in future periods 
interest expense income 
our interest expense increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our interest income increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the effective interest charges on our convertible notes of  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and as of december   the convertible notes had been fully converted and therefore  interest expense is expected to decrease 
income tax expense 
our provision for income taxes decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our effective income tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of the effective income tax rate was mainly attributable to the non deductible impairment loss of goodwill and loss on abandonment and write off of long lived assets 
net income attributable to company

our total sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in sales during fiscal year is primarily attributable to a general increase in the price and volume of plasma based products 
among the factors that contributed to the growth in revenue  foreign exchange translation accounted for of the increase 
most of our approved products recorded price increases ranging from to  except for human albumin products  which decreased by 
the decrease in the price of human albumin in is primarily due to the increased volume of imported human albumin products in the prc market during the period 
we expect that this trend may continue as long as the volume of the imported human albumin products continues to grow 
for as compared to  the average price for our approved human albumin products  which contributed to our total sales  decreased  the average price for our approved human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection  which contributed to our total sales  increased  the average price for our approved human tetanus immunoglobulin  which contributed to our total sales  increased  the average price for our approved human rabies immunoglobulin  which contributed to our total sales  increased  and the average price for our approved human hepatitis b immunoglobulin  which contributed to our total sales  increased 
the price increase of our products was primarily attributable to the continuing shortage in supply of the plasma based products 
we were able to adjust our production plan to take advantage of the limited market supply of plasma resources to realize higher profit margins 
volume in sales for our human albumin  human hepatitis b immunoglobulin  human rabies immunoglobulin products and human tetanus immunoglobulin products increased by   and  respectively  for as compared to volume in sales for our human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection decreased by because in the market demand for human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection increased due to the outbreak of hand foot mouth disease and the price of human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection was also much enhanced 
as a result  we used the large amount of factor ii iii  the material segregated from plasma and restored separately when making centralized production of human albumin in  to produce and sell high volume of human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection in the volume in sales for human immunoglobulin for intravenous injection decreased to a comparatively normal level in cost of sales 
our total cost of sales increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  cost of sales as a percentage of sales was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of sales is due to the increase in sales  while the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to a change in the mix of products  as well as the price increase in most of the products that were sold during gross profit and gross margin

the increase in legal expense is due to the  settlement of a law suit with henan xintai and the  settlement of a law suit with sin kyung ye 
non cash employee compensation for the fiscal year ended december  increased by  to  from  for  as a result of the amortization of the grant of stock options to our senior management staff in january  february and july of research and development expenses 
for the years ended december  and  our research and development expenses were  and  respectively  an increase of  or 
as a percentage of total sales  our research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the cost associated with the development of two new products that are at the end of their respective development stage 
change in fair value of derivative liabilities 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized a loss on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of  and  respectively

interest expense income  net 
our interest expense decreased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our interest income increased by  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to our payment of a related party loan related to the acquisition of dalin in the second quarter of and conversion of million of our outstanding convertible notes in and income tax expense 
our provision for income taxes increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  and effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
the decrease in effective tax rate is mainly due to the decrease of million in change in fair value of derivative liabilities that is not tax deductible 
among the increase in income taxes  million is due to the dividend tax imposed by prc tax authorities on dividends distributed by our two main operating entities to taibang biological during net income attributable to company 
our net income attributable to company increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  net income as a percentage of total sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  as a result of the cumulative effect of the foregoing factors 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through cash flows from operations  augmented by short term bank borrowings and equity contributions by our stockholders 
as of december   we had  in cash  primarily consisting of cash on hand and demand deposits 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated cash flow all amounts in us dollars year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities  effects of exchange rate change in cash   net increase in cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year  cash and cash equivalent at end of the year   operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

among these cash outflows  the increase in inventory for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the increase in inventory was a direct result of the implementation of the day quarantine period by the prc government  which caused a longer staging period for raw material plasma inventory 
the increase in accounts receivable for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
as we increased our sales directly to end users  such as hospitals and inoculation centers that have extended credit terms  we experienced a slower turn over with our accounts receivable 
investing activities our use of cash for investing activities is primarily for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangibles  and advances on non current assets 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and during the year ended december   we paid  for acquiring equipment for shandong taibang and for buildings and construction in progress at guizhou taibang 
during the year ended december   we paid  to acquire a new company  ziguang bio tech company  paid the final  payment for the acquisition of equity in dalin   for equipment for shandong taibang and  for our plasma companies buildings and construction in progress in guizhou taibang 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled  as compared to  and net cash provided by financing activities of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net cash used in financing activities in was mainly due to a  repayment of a short term bank loan  a  payment to acquire the remaining interest in our majority owned subsidiary and a dividend payment of  to the noncontrolling interest shareholders  partly offset by cash provided by a new short term loan totaling  the increase of the cash used in financing activities in was mainly attributable to the  dividend paid by our subsidiaries to the noncontrolling interest holder  repayment of a non controlling shareholder loan of  repayment of short term bank loan of  and offset by short term bank loans and proceeds from warrants exercises of  and  respectively 
management believes that the company has sufficient cash on hand and continuing positive cash inflow  from the sale of its plasma based products in the prc market  for its operations 
obligations under material contracts the following table sets forth our material contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years due to related parties   operating lease commitment    total     seasonality of our sales our operating results and operating cash flows historically have not been subject to seasonal variations 
this pattern may change  however  as a result of new market opportunities or new product introductions 
inflation inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our investors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap  requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the useful lives of fixed assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the fair value determinations of financial and equity instruments and stock compensation awards  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  the realizability of deferred tax assets and inventories  the recoverability of goodwill  intangible asset  land use right and property  plant and equipment  and accruals for income tax uncertainties and other contingencies 
the current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty inherent in those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company mainly sells human albumin and human immunoglobulin to hospitals  inoculation centers and pharmaceutical distributors 
the company requires a contract or purchase order which specify pricing  quantity and product specifications for all sales 
delivery of the product occurs when the product is received by the customer  which is when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
sales are presented net of any discounts given to customers 
for the years ended december   and  there was no significant sales return from the customers 
fair value measurements on january   the company adopted fasb s accounting standard related to fair value measurements and began recording financial assets and liabilities subject to recurring fair value measurement at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these fair value principles prioritize valuation inputs across three broad levels 
the company considers the carrying amount of cash  receivables  payables including accrued liabilities and short term loans to approximate their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable  their stated rates of interest are equivalent to interest rates currently available 
the fair values are measured pursuant to the three levels defined by the fasb s accounting standard as follow level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instruments 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value 
the fair values of the warrants outstanding as of december   and were determined based on the binominal option pricing model  using the following key assumptions december december december expected dividend yield risk free interest rate time to maturity in years expected volatility fair value of underlying common shares per share accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses inherent in its accounts receivable portfolio 
in establishing the required allowance  management considers historical losses adjusted to take into account current market conditions and the customers financial condition  the amount of receivables in dispute  and the current receivables aging and current payment patterns 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts monthly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are carried out in the prc and we are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in north america and western europe 
accordingly  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political  economic and legal environments in the prc  and by the general state of the prc economy 
our results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations  anti inflationary measures  currency conversion and remittance abroad  and rates and methods of taxation  among other things 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short term bank loans 
although our short term loans are fixed for the terms of the loans  the terms are typically three to twelve months for short term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal 
there was no material changes in interest rates for short term bank loans renewed during the year ended december  a hypothetical increase in the annual interest rates for all of our credit facilities under which we had outstanding borrowings as of december  would decrease net income before provision for income taxes by approximately  for the year ended december  management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds

foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and majority of expenses are denominated in rmb 
all of our assets are denominated in rmb  except certain cash balances 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates of our prc s subsidiaries 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of stockholder s equity

although the people s bank of china regularly involved in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the rmb may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar or euro in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in rmb exchange rate and lessen involvement in the foreign exchange market 
account balances we maintain balances at financial institutions which  from time to time  may exceed federal deposit insurance corporation insured limits for the banks located in the united states or may exceed hong kong deposit protection board insured limits for the banks located in hong kong

inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our sales and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
