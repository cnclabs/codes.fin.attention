item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section provides management s discussion of chesapeake and its consolidated subsidiaries  with specific information on results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  as well as discussion of how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
it includes management s interpretation of financial results of the company and its operating segments  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results as well as investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with forward looking statements contained in this report  or otherwise made by or on behalf of us  since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
the following discussions and those later in the document on operating income and segment results include use of the term gross margin 
gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue 
cost of sales includes the purchased cost of natural gas  electricity and propane and the cost of labor spent on direct revenue producing activities 
gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income  which are determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe that gross margin  although a non gaap measure  is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions 
it provides investors with information that demonstrates the profitability achieved by the company under its allowed rates for regulated energy operations and under its competitive pricing structure for unregulated natural gas marketing and propane distribution operations 
our management uses gross margin in measuring our business units performance and has historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly 
other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner

table of contents b highlights and recent developments our net income for was million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  and million  or per share diluted  for and  respectively 
our results for included only the results of fpu after the acquisition on october  our operations are primarily related to natural gas  electricity and propane  both in the regulated and unregulated sectors and are generally located on the delmarva peninsula and in florida 
we also have an advanced information services subsidiary  which provides both products and consulting services 
the following is a summary of key factors affecting our businesses and their impacts on our results 
more detailed discussion and analysis are provided in the results of operations section 
weather 
weather affects customer energy consumption  especially the consumption by residential and commercial customers during the peak heating and cooling seasons 
natural gas  electricity and propane are all used for heating in our service territories and we use the number of hdd to analyze the weather impact 
only electricity is used for cooling and we use the number of cdd to analyze the weather impact 
a degree day is the measure of the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature from am to am falls above or below degrees fahrenheit 
each degree of temperature above or below degrees fahrenheit is counted as one cdd or one hdd 
we use year historical averages to define the normal weather for this analysis 
the weather in on the delmarva peninsula and in florida was six percent and percent  respectively  warmer than normal 
hdd in on the delmarva peninsula and florida were  and  respectively  compared to the normal hdd of  and  respectively 
the weather in on the delmarva peninsula and in florida was seven percent and percent  respectively  colder than normal 
on the year over year basis  the weather in on the delmarva peninsula and in florida was percent  or hdd  and percent  or hdd  respectively  warmer than the weather in this year over year weather variance significantly reduced our customers consumption and decreased our gross margin by approximately million in  compared to compared to normal weather  we estimated decreased gross margin of million in as a result of the lower customer consumption  due primarily to warmer than normal temperatures in on the delmarva peninsula and in florida 
cdd remained relatively unchanged in and  cdd in florida in  compared to  cdd in florida in and did not result in a significant variance in our gross margin 
growth 
we continue to see growth in our natural gas businesses from our efforts over the past several years to expand our services by delivering clean burning  environmentally friendly natural gas to customers 
we are identifying and developing additional opportunities that will generate growth over the next several years 
eastern shore  our natural gas transmission subsidiary  continues to extend its natural gas transmission system on the delmarva peninsula 
continued expansion of the transmission system and new services are in response to increased demand for natural gas services on the delmarva peninsula by both our delmarva natural gas distribution operation and other unaffiliated industrial customers directly connected to our transmission system 
eastern shore generated additional gross margin of million in  compared to  from the following new transportation services eastern shore s new service on the eight mile mainline extension to interconnect with tetlp s pipeline system  which commenced in january  generated million of the additional gross margin in this new service is expected to generate gross margin of million in and million annually thereafter 
eastern shore entered into two additional transportation service agreements with an existing industrial customer  one for the period from may to april and the other for the period from november to october these additional services generated additional gross margin of  and  respectively  in the year service from may to april is expected to generate annual gross margin of  the one year service from november to october is expected to generate gross margin of  in chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents also generating additional gross margin of  in  compared to  were other mainline transportation services that commenced in may  november and november  as a result of eastern shore s system expansion projects 
these other mainline transportation services are expected to generate an estimated annual gross margin of million   of which was recorded in in  eastern shore began construction of its mainline extension projects to serve southern delaware and cecil and worcester counties  maryland 
these mainline extension projects are expected to be placed in service in the first half of on december   eastern shore entered into a precedent agreement with nrg energy center dover llc nrg to provide firm natural gas transportation service to nrg s electric power generation plant in dover  delaware 
eastern shore has previously provided interruptible service to nrg at this plant 
to provide the firm service  eastern shore will construct new facilities at an estimated cost of million to million 
the precedent agreement provides that upon satisfying certain conditions  eastern shore and nrg will sign a year firm transportation service agreement for a maximum daily quantity of  dts d 
this service is projected to commence in may and is expected to generate estimated annual gross margin of to million 
if the necessary facilities are not operational on or before december   or if eastern shore is not able to provide the firm transportation service by utilizing other capacity  either eastern shore or nrg may terminate both the precedent agreement and the firm transportation service agreement 
eastern shore and nrg are proceeding with obtaining necessary governmental and regulatory approvals associated with this service 
our delmarva natural gas distribution operation has successfully expanded its service to large commercial and industrial customers and has continued its efforts to extend natural gas service to lewes  delaware and cecil and worcester counties  maryland 
since july  our delmarva natural gas distribution operation added large commercial and industrial customers with an estimated annual gross margin of million million and  was recorded in and  respectively  from these new customers  including two industrial customers in lewes  delaware 
in addition to these new customers  we entered into a new agreement in august to provide natural gas service to an existing industrial customer at two of its facilities located in southern delaware 
these new services are expected to begin in the first quarter of and generate estimated annual gross margin equivalent to residential customers 
our delmarva natural gas distribution operation also experienced two percent growth in residential customers  generating additional gross margin of  in our florida natural gas distribution operation generated  of additional gross margin in  primarily from a two percent growth in commercial and industrial customers 
in addition  new customers  added as a result of our purchase of the igc operating assets in august  generated  of additional gross margin during  due to the inclusion of a full year of results 
in january  peninsula pipeline executed an agreement with peoples gas for the joint construction  ownership and operation of a mile pipeline from the duval nassau county line to amelia island  florida 
this jointly owned pipeline will provide us with the ability to extend natural gas service to nassau county 
peninsula pipeline s portion of the estimated cost in this project is approximately million  with the completion of the construction projected to be in the second half of our florida electric distribution operation did not experience significant customer growth in rates and regulatory matters 
during  we concluded two major regulatory proceedings 
following its agenda conference in december  the florida psc issued an order in january  approving the recovery of million in acquisition adjustment and million in merger related costs in connection with our acquisition of fpu in in the order  the florida psc also determined that no refund is required to customers from the earnings of our florida natural gas distribution operation 
the outcome of this come back filing resulted in the reversal in the fourth quarter of  of the  regulatory reserve  which was previously accrued in the third and fourth quarters of this reserve was previously accrued based on the contingent regulatory risk associated with our florida operation s natural gas earnings  merger benefits and recovery of the acquisition adjustment 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents the inclusion of the acquisition adjustment and merger related costs in our rate base and the recovery of these assets through amortization expense will increase our earnings and cash flows above what we would have been able to achieve absent the regulatory approval 
the acquisition adjustment and merger related costs will be amortized over years and five years  respectively  beginning in november based upon the effective date and outcome of the order  amortization will be reflected as expense in our consolidated statement of income beginning in we will record million million  net of tax in amortization expense related to these assets in and  million million  net of tax in and million million  net of tax annually  thereafter until on january   the ferc approved the rate case settlement for eastern shore 
the settlement provides for a pre tax return of percent 
also included in the settlement is a negotiated rate adjustment  effective november   associated with the phase in of an additional  dts d of new transportation service on eastern shore s eight mile extension to interconnect with tetlp s pipeline system 
this rate adjustment reduces the rate per dt of the service on this eight mile extension by reflecting the increased service of  dts d with no additional revenue 
this rate adjustment effectively offsets the increased revenue that would have been generated from the  dts d increase in firm service 
in  we recorded  in additional gross margin as a result of implementing the new rates pursuant to the settlement 
in addition to regulatory proceedings  we are currently involved in a legal dispute over alleged breaches of the franchise agreement by fpu 
the alleging city seeks a declaratory judgment that the city has the right to exercise its option to purchase fpu s electric distribution property in the city 
fpu intends to vigorously contest this litigation and intends to oppose the adoption of any proposed referendum to approve the purchase of the fpu property in the city 
fpu serves approximately  customers in the city 
in  we incurred approximately  in legal costs associated with this electric franchise dispute 
propane prices 
propane prices affect both retail and wholesale marketing margins 
our propane distribution operation usually benefits from rising propane prices by selling propane to its distribution customers based upon higher wholesale prices  while its average cost of inventory trails behind 
retail prices generally take into account replacement cost  along with other factors  such as competition and market conditions 
when wholesale prices replacement costs increase  retail prices generally increase and our margins expand until the current wholesale price is fully reflected in the average cost of inventory 
the opposite occurs when propane prices decline 
our propane wholesale marketing operation benefits from price volatility in the propane wholesale market by entering into trading transactions 
our propane distribution operations generated additional gross margin of million due to higher retail margins per gallon in  compared to propane retail margins per gallon on the delmarva peninsula during returned to more normal levels  compared to the lower margins per gallon reported during  which was caused by colder temperatures and the high cost of spot purchases during the first quarter of also contributing to the gross margin increase were higher margins per gallon in florida as the florida propane operation continued to adjust its retail pricing in response to market opportunities  which contributed to the increased retail margins 
higher price volatility in the wholesale propane market resulted in a percent increase in xeron s trading volumes in  compared to  and generated  of additional gross margin 
advanced information services 
in september  bravepoint  our advanced information services subsidiary  released a new product  profitzoom  an integrated system encompassing financial  job costing and service management modules  which was designed specifically for the fire protection and specialty contracting industries 
profitzoom was built as a successor product to another software solution that bravepoint previously marketed and supported for companies in the fire suppression industry 
understanding the needs of the industry and utilizing its technology expertise  bravepoint began developing the profitzoom product in bravepoint s operating income declined by  in  compared to  as a result of additional costs incurred in connection with the launch of profitzoom tm 
bravepoint has successfully implemented profitzoom tm for three customers and two additional customers have executed contracts to implement it in early in addition  bravepoint is utilizing a component of profitzoom tm  application evolution tm  to provide services to new and existing customers 
application evolution tm is currently being used to provide services to seven customers and bravepoint currently has contracts for services to four additional customers in bravepoint recorded  in revenue in from these new contracts with approximately  in additional revenue associated with these contracts to be recognized in the first half of several other sales proposals are under consideration by current and other potential customers

table of contents c critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
since most of our businesses are regulated and the accounting methods used by these businesses must comply with the requirements of the regulatory bodies  the choices available are limited by these regulatory requirements 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following policies require significant estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies and their application have been discussed with our audit committee 
regulatory assets and liabilities as a result of the ratemaking process  we record certain assets and liabilities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  regulated operations  and consequently  the accounting principles applied by our regulated energy businesses differ in certain respects from those applied by the unregulated businesses 
costs are deferred when there is a probable expectation that they will be recovered in future revenues as a result of the regulatory process 
as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note a  summary of accounting policies  we have recorded regulatory assets of million and regulatory liabilities of million at december  if we were required to terminate application of asc topic  we would be required to recognize all such deferred amounts as a charge or a credit to earnings  net of applicable income taxes 
such an adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations 
valuation of environmental assets and liabilities as more fully described in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note p  environmental commitments and contingencies  we are currently participating in the investigation  assessment or remediation of six former mgp sites 
we have also been in discussions with mde regarding a seventh former mgp site 
amounts have been recorded as environmental liabilities and associated environmental regulatory assets based on estimates of future costs to remediate these sites  which are provided by independent consultants  and future recovery of those costs in rates 
at december   we had million in environmental liabilities  representing our estimate of such future costs 
we also had million in regulatory and other assets  representing the amount of our environmental remediation costs to be recovered in future rates 
there is uncertainty in these amounts  because the united states environmental protection agency epa  or other applicable state environmental authority  may not have selected the final remediation methods 
in addition  there is uncertainty with regard to amounts that may be recovered from other potentially responsible parties 
derivatives we use derivative and non derivative instruments to manage the risks related to obtaining adequate supplies and the price fluctuations of natural gas  electricity and propane 
we also use derivative instruments to engage in propane wholesale marketing activities 
we continually monitor the use of these instruments to ensure compliance with our risk management policies and account for them in accordance with appropriate gaap 
if these instruments do not meet the definition of derivatives or are considered normal purchases and sales  they are accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
the following is a review of our use of derivative instruments at december  and during and  our natural gas distribution  electric distribution  propane distribution and natural gas marketing operations entered into physical contracts for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity and propane 
these contracts either did not meet the definition of derivatives as they did not have a minimum requirement to purchase sell or were considered normal purchases and sales  as they provided for the purchase or sale of natural gas  electricity or propane to be delivered in quantities expected to be used and sold by our operations over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  these contracts were accounted for on an accrual basis of accounting 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents during and  the propane distribution operation entered into put options to protect against the decline in propane prices and related potential inventory losses associated with the propane purchased for the propane price cap program in the upcoming heating season 
we accounted for the put option entered in august as a fair value hedge 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of this put option of  during effectively reduced propane inventory balance 
for the put option entered in october  we elected not to designate it as a fair value hedge although it met all the accounting requirements 
accordingly  the change in the fair value of this put option of  during reduced our earnings 
at december  and  these put options had the fair value of  and  respectively 
xeron  our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary  enters into forward  futures and other contracts that are considered derivatives 
these contracts are mark to market  using prices at the end of each reporting period  and unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income as revenue or expense 
these contracts generally mature within one year and are almost exclusively for propane commodities 
for and  these contracts had net unrealized gains of  and  respectively 
we had million in mark to market energy assets and million in mark to market energy liabilities related to these contracts at december  we had million in mark to market energy assets and million in mark to market energy liabilities related to these contracts at december  operating revenues revenues for our natural gas and electric distribution operations are based on rates approved by the psc of the state in which we operate 
eastern shore s revenues are based on rates approved by the ferc 
customers base rates may not be changed without formal approval by these commissions 
the pscs  however  have authorized our regulated operations to negotiate rates  based on approved methodologies  with customers that have competitive alternatives 
the ferc has also authorized eastern shore to negotiate rates above or below the ferc approved maximum rates  which customers can elect as an alternative to negotiated rates 
for regulated deliveries of natural gas and electricity  we read meters and bill customers on monthly cycles that do not coincide with the accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we accrue unbilled revenues for natural gas and electricity that have been delivered  but not yet billed  at the end of an accounting period to the extent that they do not coincide 
in connection with this accrual  we must estimate amounts of natural gas and electricity that have been delivered to our systems but have not been accounted for commonly known as unaccounted for gas and electricity 
we estimate the amount of the unbilled revenue by jurisdiction and customer class 
a similar computation is made to accrue unbilled revenues for propane customers with meters  such as community gas system customers  and natural gas marketing customers  whose billing cycles do not coincide with the accounting periods 
the propane wholesale marketing operation records trading activity for open contracts on a net mark to market basis in the statement of income 
for certain propane distribution customers without meters and advanced information services customers  we record revenue in the period the products are delivered and or services are rendered 
each of our natural gas distribution operations in delaware and maryland  our bundled natural gas distribution service in florida and our electric distribution operation in florida has a purchased fuel cost recovery mechanism 
this mechanism provides us with a method of adjusting billing rates to customers to reflect changes in the cost of purchased fuel 
the difference between the current cost of fuel purchased and the cost of fuel recovered in billed rates is deferred and accounted for as either unrecovered purchased fuel cost or amounts payable to customers 
generally  these deferred amounts are recovered or refunded within one year 
we charge flexible rates to industrial interruptible customers on our natural gas distribution systems to compete with the price of alternative fuel that they can use 
neither we nor any of our interruptible customers are contractually obligated to deliver or receive natural gas on a firm service basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experience  the condition of the overall economy and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
if circumstances change  however  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable may also change 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas  electricity and propane prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected returns on plan assets  assumed discount rates  the level of contributions made to the plans  and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rates and the expected returns on plan assets are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on the pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rates  the assumed health care cost trend rates and the assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
additional information is presented in item under the heading notes to the consolidated financial statements note m  employee benefit plans  including plan asset investment allocation  estimated future benefit payments  general descriptions of the plans  significant assumptions  the impact of certain changes in assumptions  and significant changes in estimates 
the total pension and other postretirement benefit costs included in operating income were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
the total costs for included  of settlement charges associated with the retirement of a former executive 
we expect to record pension and postretirement benefit costs of approximately million for actuarial assumptions affecting include expected long term rates of return on plan assets of percent and percent for chesapeake s pension plan and fpu s pension plan  respectively  and discount rates of percent and percent for chesapeake s plans and fpu s plans  respectively 
the discount rate for each plan was determined by management considering high quality corporate bond rates  such as moody s aa bond index and the citigroup yield curve  changes in those rates from the prior year and other pertinent factors  including the expected lives of the plans and the availability of the lump sum payment option 
actual changes in the fair value of plan assets and the differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension and postretirement benefit costs that we ultimately recognize 
a percent change in the discount rate could change our pension and postretirement costs by approximately  a percent change in the rate of return could change our pension cost by approximately  and will not have an impact on the postretirement and serp plans because these plans are not funded

all of our outstanding long term debt is fixed rate debt and was not entered into for trading purposes 
the carrying value of outstanding long term debt  including current maturities  was million at december   as compared to a fair value of million  based on a discounted cash flow methodology that incorporates a market interest rate that is based on published corporate borrowing rates for debt instruments with similar terms and average maturities with adjustments for duration  optionality  credit risk  and risk profile 
we evaluate whether to refinance existing debt or permanently refinance existing short term borrowing  based in part on the fluctuation in interest rates 
our propane distribution business is exposed to market risk as a result of propane storage activities and entering into fixed price contracts for supply 
we can store up to approximately million gallons including leased storage and rail cars of propane during the winter season to meet our customers peak requirements and to serve metered customers 
decreases in the wholesale price of propane may cause the value of stored propane to decline 
to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations  we have adopted a risk management policy that allows the propane distribution operation to enter into fair value hedges or other economic hedges of our inventory 
in august  our delmarva propane distribution operation entered into a put option to protect against the decline in propane prices and related potential inventory losses associated with  gallons purchased for the propane price cap program in the upcoming heating season 
this put option is exercised if the propane prices fall below the strike price of per gallon in january through march of and we will receive the difference between the market price and the strike price during those months

as of december   the put option had no fair value 
the change in the fair value of the put option reduced our earnings in our propane wholesale marketing operation is a party to natural gas liquids forward contracts  primarily propane contracts  with various third parties 
these contracts require that the propane wholesale marketing operation purchase or sell natural gas liquids at a fixed price at fixed future dates 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of natural gas liquids to us  or the counterparty or by booking out the transaction 
booking out is a procedure for financially settling a contract in lieu of the physical delivery of energy 
the propane wholesale marketing operation also enters into futures contracts that are traded on the new york mercantile exchange 
in certain cases  the futures contracts are settled by the payment or receipt of a net amount equal to the difference between the current market price of the futures contract and the original contract price  however  they may also be settled by physical receipt or delivery of propane 
chesapeake utilities corporation form k page 
table of contents the forward and futures contracts entered into by our propane wholesale marketing subsidiary are for trading purposes 
the propane wholesale marketing business is subject to commodity price risk on its open positions to the extent that market prices for natural gas liquids deviate from fixed contract settlement prices 
market risk associated with the trading of futures and forward contracts is monitored daily for compliance with our risk management policy  which includes volumetric limits for open positions 
to manage exposures to changing market prices  open positions are marked up or down to market prices and reviewed daily by our oversight officials 
in addition  the risk management committee reviews periodic reports on markets and the credit risk of counterparties  approves any exceptions to the risk management policy within limits established by the board of directors and authorizes the use of any new types of contracts

table of contents i competition our natural gas and electric distribution operations and our natural gas transmission operation compete with other forms of energy including natural gas  electricity  oil  propane and other alternative sources of energy 
the principal competitive factors are price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
our natural gas distribution operations have several large volume industrial customers that are able to use fuel oil as an alternative to natural gas 
when oil prices decline  these interruptible customers may convert to oil to satisfy their fuel requirements  and our interruptible sales volumes may decline 
oil prices  as well as the prices of other fuels  fluctuate for a variety of reasons  therefore  future competitive conditions are not predictable 
to address this uncertainty  we use flexible pricing arrangements on both the supply and sales sides of this business to compete with alternative fuel price fluctuations 
as a result of the transmission operation s conversion to open access and chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division s restructuring of its services  these businesses have shifted from providing bundled transportation and sales service to providing only transmission and contract storage services 
our electric distribution operation currently does not face substantial competition since the electric utility industry in florida has not been deregulated 
in addition  natural gas is the only viable alternative fuel to electricity in our electric service territories and is available only in a small area 
our natural gas distribution operations in delaware  maryland and florida offer unbundled transportation services to certain commercial and industrial customers 
in  chesapeake s florida natural gas distribution division  central florida gas  extended such service to residential customers 
with such transportation service available on our distribution systems  we are competing with third party suppliers to sell gas to industrial customers 
with respect to unbundled transportation services  our competitors include interstate transmission companies  if the distribution customers are located close enough to a transmission company s pipeline to make connections economically feasible 
the customers at risk are usually large volume commercial and industrial customers with the financial resources and capability to bypass our existing distribution operations in this manner 
in certain situations  our distribution operations may adjust services and rates for these customers to retain their business 
we expect to continue to expand the availability of unbundled transportation service to additional classes of distribution customers in the future 
we have also established a natural gas marketing operation in florida  delaware and maryland to provide such service to customers eligible for unbundled transportation services 
our propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors in their respective geographic markets  primarily on the basis of service and price  emphasizing responsive and reliable service 
our competitors generally include local outlets of national distributors and local independent distributors  whose proximity to customers entails lower costs to provide service 
propane competes with electricity as an energy source  because it is typically less expensive than electricity  based on equivalent btu value 
propane also competes with home heating oil as an energy source 
since natural gas has historically been less expensive than propane  propane is generally not distributed in geographic areas served by natural gas pipeline or distribution systems 
the propane wholesale marketing operation competes against various regional and national marketers  many of which have significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages 
our advanced information services subsidiary faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantially greater resources available to them than does our subsidiary 
in addition  changes in the advanced information services business are occurring rapidly and could adversely affect the markets for the products and services offered by these businesses 
this segment competes on the basis of technological expertise  reputation and price

table of contents j inflation inflation affects the cost of supply  labor  products and services required for operations  maintenance and capital improvements 
while the impact of inflation has remained low in recent years  natural gas and propane prices are subject to rapid fluctuations 
in the regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations  fluctuations in natural gas and electricity prices are passed on to customers through the fuel cost recovery mechanism in our tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on our capital investments and returns  we seek rate increases from regulatory commissions for our regulated operations and closely monitor the returns of our unregulated business operations 
to compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices  we adjust our propane sales prices to the extent allowed by the market
