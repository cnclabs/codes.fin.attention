planned principal operations have commenced and existing cash resources along with forecasted sales for the upcoming fiscal year are expected to provide sufficient funds to carry out our plan of operations including exploration and development activities for the next twelve months 
the company s continuation as a going concern for a period longer than twelve months will be dependent upon the company s ability to obtain adequate financing  as future capital expenditures of the company are expected to be substantial 
historically  the company has been reliant primarily on equity financings from the sale of its common shares to fund its operations  and this reliance is expected to continue for the foreseeable future

however  there is no assurance that sufficient funds can continue to be raised in the future through equity financings  in which case the company may not be able to continue exploration or development of its mineral projects  possibly leading to their abandonment 
other options would include entering into joint venture arrangements to continue advancing the company s mineral projects  which would depend entirely on finding a suitable third party willing to enter into such an arrangement  typically involving an assignment of a percentage interest in the mineral project
