business overview we operate our business through our wholly owned subsidiaries  e jenie technology development co  ltd 
e jenie  shenzhen anytone technology co  ltd 
shenzhen anytone  shenzhen newpower technology co  ltd 
newpower  and shenzhen kim fai solar energy technology co  ltd 
kim fai  companies incorporated under the laws of the peoples republic of china prc or china 
through our subsidiaries  we manufacture and distribute lithium battery shells and related products primarily in china 
based on customer specifications  e jenie develops  customizes and produces steel and aluminum battery shells and caps 
we manufacture and distribute battery shells and covers for cellular phones 
we maintain long term relationships with large lithium battery manufacturers 
we believe we will continue to receive orders from our customers because of our reputation and the quality of our products 
our professional marketing team maintains relationships with our current customers and at the same time searches for potential new customers 
we seek to maintain and strengthen our position as a provider of battery shells and caps while increasing the breadth of our product line and improving the quality of our products 
in august  under the current depressed economic environment  management of the company made some adjustments to keep the company running and growing 
to keep the existing battery pack accessories segment  the company expanded into a related field finished battery packs assembly and distribution  to diversify our line of products  consequently  the company competes in the entire battery industry 
the lithium battery was created in the s  with the first mass production in in japan 
lithium batteries were first used in notebook computers and now are used in cellular phones  video machines  laptops  digital cameras  mp players  global positioning satellite systems  g communication devices  hybrid cars and other electronic products 
batteries are becoming smaller  lighter  more efficient  longer lasting and free of pollution 
the lithium battery energy weight ratio exceeds its counterparts and with an excellent safety standard we believe it is the future of the battery industry 
according to market research  the market for lithium ion battery is expected to reach billion by china has become one of the largest producers and consumers of lithium ion batteries 
we anticipate there will be greater demand for lithium batteries in china and worldwide in the next few years 
we believe the current trend towards smaller  lighter portable consumer products will continue and because of its size  the demand for lithium batteries will keep increasing 
having engaged in the battery business for years  management of the company has accumulated abundant knowledge about the battery industry  established a strong network among battery companies which are both upstream and downstream in the battery distribution flow  and gained a lot of experience in battery distribution  therefore  we believe the company is in a more favorable position than other companies in distributing finished batteries 
assembling and distributing finished batteries has a higher profit margin than manufacturing battery accessories  so management of the company is confident our battery distribution business will be profitable due to the outstanding battery quality and strong distribution network the company has 
on december   we closed the transactions contemplated by the share exchange agreement dated november  with anytone international hk co  ltd 
anytone international and shenzhen anytone 
pursuant to the share exchange agreement  we issued the shareholders of anytone international  shares of the company s restricted common stock and paid  in cash 
shenzhen anytone is the chinese operating subsidiary of anytone international  collectively referred to a anytone 
anytone is engaged in the production of mobile power and related power backup products 
through anytone  we development and market our branded mobile power and related power backup devices 
shenzhen anytone was founded in and has very strong ability in r d and marketing 
in addition  anytone has built its branded name in china and its products are sold to the end consumers directly 
by focusing on r d and marketing  anytone only produces some sample products in house for testing and majorly outsourcing its production to the third parties who are certified by anytone 
mobile power is lithium ion batteries application products 
currently  more and more advanced portable consumer electronic products are introduced to the market  such as laptop  smartphones  tablet pc and etc 
all of these high technology products and the functions they have are power consuming monsters 
the original single lithium ion battery is not enough to support these products 
mobile power is the solution to feed these power consuming monsters 
compare to the creation of lithium ion battery was in the s  mobile power was started around years ago and became popular and competitive in the recent few years 
the increasing competition is due to increasing demand many consumers have more than one portable consumer electronic devices and they need power support  higher profits mobile powers are sold to end consumers directly  low technology limit a mobile power includes three major components which are battery cell  pcb and case 
therefore  most of lithium ion battery related manufacturers can enter easily  no industry standards mobile power is still a new business in the lithium ion battery industry without official standards 
therefore  this market is very disorder and the counterfeit or exaggerate products are sold all over the market 
however  we believed that this market is still at the early stage 
once the official industry standards are created and the consumers feedbacks are accumulated  only those products with real quality will survive 
on january   we closed the transactions contemplated by the share exchange agreement dated december  with newpower 
pursuant to the share exchange agreement  our chinese subsidiary e jenie acquired newpower 
we issued the shareholders of newpower  shares of the company s restricted common stock and paid them  in cash 
newpower is engaged in manufacturing and distribution of lithium battery cells 
on november   the company s subsidiary  shenzhen anytone executed a share exchange agreement to acquire all the equity interest of kim fai  a chinese company engaged in the technology development and sale of solar application products and solar energy batteries  with all of the shareholders of kim fai 
the price for the outstanding stock of kim fai was  to be paid in cash  and  shares of common stock valued at  which was determined by multiplying the  shares by the stock price of new energy on november  as of september    was paid and  shares were issued 
on november   the company entered into an equity transfer agreement with xuemei fang fang and weirong xu xu  and together with fang  the buyers to transfer of the equity interest of billion electronics limited bvi to the buyers for rmb  
the selling price equals the appraised value of billion electronics  including its wholly owned subsidiaries shenzhen e jenie and shenzhen newpower less rmb   of debt that the company owes e jenie  which shall be cancelled upon completion of the equity transfer 
xu is the director of marketing of newpower and fang is the vice president of e jenie 
as of february   the company received rmb   and had an outstanding receivable of rmb  
during the third quarter of  the company performed annual goodwill impairment assessment for newpower 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed annual goodwill impairment assessment for anytone and kim fai 
the goodwill balance prior to the impairment charge was  and was established primarily as a result of a series acquisition of newpower  anytone and kim fai in and the company completed the step one analysis using a combination of market capitalization approach and discounted cash flow 
the market capitalization approach uses the company s publicly traded stock price to determine fair value 
the dcf method uses revenue and expense projections and risk adjusted discount rates 
the process of determining fair value is subjective and requires management to exercise a significant amount of judgment in determining future growth rates  discount and tax rates and other factors 
the current economic environment has impacted the company s ability to forecast future demand and has in turn resulted in the use of higher discount rates  reflecting the risk and uncertainty in current markets 
the results of the step one analysis indicated potential impairment in newpower and anytone reporting units  which were corroborated by a combination of factors including a significant and sustained decline in the market capitalization  which is significantly below the book value  and the deteriorating macro environment  which has resulted in a decline in expected future demand 
the company therefore performed the second step of the goodwill impairment assessment for newpower and anytone to quantify the amount of impairment 
this involved calculating the implied fair value of goodwill  determined in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  and comparing the residual amount to the carrying amount of goodwill 
based on the analysis incorporating the declining market capitalization in  as well as the significant end market deterioration and economic uncertainties impacting expected future demand including continued slow down of the battery industry in china  and increased competition resulting from counterfeit products and decreased selling pricefrom other manufacturers 
the company concluded that the entire goodwill balance of newpower of  and a portion of anytone s goodwill of  were impaired and recorded in operating expense 
the goodwill impairment charge is non cash 
the goodwill impairment charge is not deductible for income tax purposes and  therefore  the company has not recorded a corresponding tax benefit in on december   the company fully disposed its subsidiaries billion  e jenie and newpower 
as of december   the company concluded there was no impairment to the goodwill for kim fai reporting unit after performing the step one analysis by using the discounted cash flow method with each reporting unit s fair value greater than the carrying value including the goodwill

working capital requirements historically  cash from operations  short term financing and the sale of our company stock have been sufficient to meet our cash needs 
we believe we will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet our working capital needs 
however  our actual working capital needs for the long and short term will depend upon numerous factors  including operating results  competition  and the availability of credit facilities  none of which can be predicted with certainty 
future expansion will be limited by economic environment for the industry and opportunities and availability of financing and raising capital by selling stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we have never entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and have never established any special purpose entities 
we have not guaranteed any debt of other entities or entered into any options on non financial assets 
critical accounting policies while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis 
basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle in the united states us gaap 
the company s functional currency is the chinese yuan renminbi cny or rmb  however the accompanying consolidated financial statements were translated and presented in united states dollars or usd 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of new energy systems group and its wholly owned subsidiaries billion  e jenie  anytone  kim fai and newpower  are collectively referred to the company 
billion  e jenie and newpower were disposed on december  all material intercompany accounts  transactions and profits were eliminated in consolidation 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include collectability of accounts receivable  accounts payable  sales returns and recoverability of long term assets 
revenue recognition the company manufactures and distributes batteries  battery shells and covers for portable consumer electronic devices in the prc 
the company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab codified in fasb asc topic 
sales revenue is recognized when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery is complete  no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
no revenue is recognized if there are significant uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due or the possible return of goods 
payments received before satisfaction of all relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue 
sales revenue is the invoiced value of goods  net of value added tax vat 
all of the company s products sold in the prc are subject to chinese value added tax of of the gross sales price 
this vat may be offset by vat paid by the company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing the finished product 
the company records vat payable and vat receivable net of payments in the financial statements 
the vat tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables 
sales and purchases are recorded net of vat collected and paid as the company acts as an agent for the government 
recent accounting pronouncement in september  fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing goodwill for impairment  to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment 
asu no 
allows entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if greater than percent likelihood exists that the fair value is less than the carrying amount then a two step goodwill impairment test as described in topic must be performed 
the guidance provided by this update becomes effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  fasb issued asu  comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under both options  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in a single continuous statement  the entity is required to present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with the total of comprehensive income in that statement 
in the two statement approach  an entity is required to present components of net income and total net income in the statement of net income 
the statement of other comprehensive income should immediately follow the statement of net income and include the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with a total for comprehensive income 
in addition  the entity is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented
