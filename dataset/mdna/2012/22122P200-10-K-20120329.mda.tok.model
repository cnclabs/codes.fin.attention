item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended january   december   and december  should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements below and elsewhere in this annual report 
business overview system wide restaurants fiscal year company owned franchise total company owned franchise total company owned franchise total restaurants at beginning of period company owned sold to franchisee new restaurants opened restaurants permanently closed restaurants at end of period as of january   there were company owned and franchised premium convenience restaurants operating in states  the district of columbia  and the united arab emirates uae 
during fiscal  we closed three company owned restaurants  one of each in oak park  il  new york  ny  and meadowbrook  mi 
during the same fiscal year  three franchised restaurants closed  one of each in florida  illinois  and massachusetts 
our restaurants offer innovative  savory  made to order products featuring our authentic hearth baked crackly crust signature cosi bread and fresh distinctive ingredients 
we maintain a pipeline of new menu offerings that are introduced seasonally through limited time offerings to keep our products relevant to our target customers 
our menu features high quality sandwiches  freshly tossed salads  breakfast wraps  cosi squagels  hot melts  flatbread pizzas  s mores and other desserts  and a variety of coffees along with other soft drink beverages  bottled beverages including premium still and sparkling water  teas  alcoholic beverages  and other specialty coffees and beverages 
our restaurants offer lunch and afternoon coffee in a counter service format  with most offering breakfast and or dinner and dessert menus as well 
we are currently eligible to offer franchises in states and the district of columbia 
we offer franchises to area developers and individual franchise operators 
the initial franchise fee  payable to us  for both an area developer and an individual franchise operator  is  for the first restaurant and  for each additional restaurant 
we believe that offering cosi franchised restaurants to area developers and individual franchisees offers the prospects of strong financial returns 
by franchising  we believe we will be able to increase the presence of our restaurants in various markets throughout the country and generate additional revenue without the large upfront capital commitments and risk associated with opening company owned restaurants 

table of contents we believe that incorporating a franchising and area developer model into our strategy will position us to maximize the market potential for the cosi brand and concept consistent with our available capital  and we expect that company owned restaurants restaurants that we own as opposed to franchised restaurants will always be an important part of our new restaurant growth 
we also continue to explore strategic opportunities with our cosi pronto our grab and go concept and full service concepts in educational establishments  airports  train stations and other public venues that meet our operating and financial criteria 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the application of our accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable and generally accepted for companies in the restaurant industry 
we believe that the following addresses the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
there have been no material changes in the application of our most critical accounting policies and estimates  judgments and assumptions during fiscal long lived assets asc property  plant  equipment requires management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the application of this standard has affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results that have been significant in recent years 
we evaluate possible impairment at the individual restaurant level periodically and record an impairment loss whenever we determine impairment factors are present 
we consider a history of poor financial operating performance to be the primary indicator of potential impairment for individual restaurant locations 
we determine whether a restaurant location is impaired based on expected undiscounted cash flows  generally for the remainder of the lease term  and then determine the impairment charge based on discounted cash flows for the same period 
restaurants are not considered for impairment during the ramp up period before they enter the comparable restaurant base  unless specific circumstances warrant otherwise 
lease termination charges asc exit or disposal cost obligations requires companies to recognize a liability for the costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  rather than at the time of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
for all exit activities  we estimate our likely liability under contractual leases for restaurants that have been closed 
such estimates have affected the amount and timing of charges to operating results and are impacted by management s judgments about the time it may take to find a suitable subtenant or assignee  or the terms under which a termination of the lease agreement may be negotiated with the landlord 
accounting for lease obligations in accordance with asc leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date we take possession 
we include any rent escalations  rent abatements during the construction period and any other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense calculation 

table of contents landlord allowances in accordance with asc leases  we record landlord allowances as deferred rent in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and amortize them on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
stock based compensation expense in accordance with asc compensation stock compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense according to the fair value recognition provision  which generally requires  among other things  that all employee share based compensation be measured using a fair value method and that all the resulting compensation expense be recognized in the financial statements 
we measure the estimated fair value of our granted stock options using a black scholes pricing model and of our restricted stock based on the fair market value of a share of registered stock on the date of grant 
the weighted average fair values of the stock options granted through  the last time we issued stock options  were determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
income taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets that relate primarily to net operating loss carry forwards 
our determination of the valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards based on the company s operating results 
a positive adjustment to income will be recorded in future years if we determine that we could realize these deferred tax assets 
revenue restaurant net sales 
our company owned restaurant sales are composed almost entirely of food and beverage sales 
we record revenue at the time of the purchase of our products by our customers 
franchise fees and royalties 
franchise fees and royalties includes fees earned from franchise agreements entered into with area developers and franchise operators  as well as royalties received based on sales generated at franchised restaurants 
we recognize the franchise fee in the period in which a franchise location opens or when fees are forfeited as a result of a termination of an area developer agreement 
we recognize franchise royalties in the period in which sales are made by our franchise operators 
gift card sales 
we offer our customers the opportunity to purchase gift cards at our restaurants and through our website 
customers can purchase these cards at varying dollar amounts 
at the time of purchase by the customer  we record a gift card liability for the face value of the card purchased 
we recognize the revenue and reduce the gift card liability when the gift card is redeemed 
we do not reduce our recorded liability for potential non use of purchased gift cards 
comparable restaurant sales in calculating comparable restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for full months

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were approximately million on january   compared with million on december  we had negative working capital of approximately million on january   compared with positive working capital of million on december  the decrease in working capital as of january  is primarily due to the funding of the operating loss during fiscal our principal requirements for cash in will be for working capital needs and routine maintenance of our existing restaurants

table of contents although development of company owned restaurants is part of our long term growth plan  we currently do not have any locations under development 
however  we will continue to seek out and evaluate opportunities to develop new company owned locations in existing markets 
we do expect to incur capital costs associated with the maintenance of existing company owned restaurants during fiscal as we currently have no credit facility or available line of credit  we expect to fund any required restaurant capital maintenance costs on existing company owned restaurants or required capital for new restaurant development  if any  from cash and cash equivalents on hand  expected cash flows generated by existing company owned restaurants  and expected franchise fees and royalties 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and the expected cash flows from company owned restaurant operations and expected franchise fees and royalties will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for working capital needs and the maintenance of existing restaurants for the next twelve months 
our conclusion is based on our expected performance for fiscal and includes a sensitivity analysis that projects varying levels of decline in consumer demand 
the range of levels selected was based on our reasonable expectation of demand given the seasonality of our historical performance and the potential impact the current economic environment may have on consumer spending 
in analyzing our capital cash outlays during fiscal years and  and  respectively  of our capital expenditures were spent on improvements and repairs and maintenance associated with existing company owned locations 
the balance of the capital cash outlays was spent on information technology related projects 
if our company owned restaurants do not generate the cash flow levels that we expect  if new franchised restaurants do not open according to our expectations  if we do not generate the franchise fees and royalties that we currently expect  if we incur significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond our normal liquidity needs  or if we experience other unforeseen circumstances then  in order to fund our cash requirements  we may have to effect further labor reductions in general and administrative support functions  seek to sell certain company owned locations to franchisees and or other third parties  seek other sources of financing or take other actions necessitated by the impact of such unanticipated circumstances 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing or sell company owned locations to franchisees or other third parties or that we will be able to do so in a timely manner and on acceptable terms to meet our requirements 
given the continued instability in the credit and financial markets  it may be difficult for the company to obtain additional financing and for franchisees to obtain the financing necessary to open restaurants or to acquire company owned locations 
an inability to access additional sources of liquidity to fund our cash needs could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if internally generated cash flow from our restaurants does not meet our expectations  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our cash resources  and therefore our liquidity  are highly dependent upon the level of internally generated cash from operations and upon future financing transactions 
although we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital requirements for the next twelve months  if cash flows from our existing restaurants or cash flows from new restaurants that we open or from franchise fees and royalties do not meet our expectations or are otherwise insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may have to seek additional financing from external sources to continue funding our operations or reduce or cease our plans to open or franchise new restaurants 
we cannot predict whether such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 

table of contents we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable terms 
our business has in the past required  and may continue to require  significant additional capital to  among other things  fund our operations  increase the number of company owned or franchised restaurants  expand the range of services we offer and finance future acquisitions and investments 
there is no assurance that financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional financings unattractive to us 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

table of contents forward looking statements 
we qualify any forward looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and interest that we may pay on debt 
we have no derivative financial commodity instruments 
we invest our excess cash in investment grade  highly liquid  short term investments 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
during fiscal  we held no short term investments and  as a result  a hypothetical one percentage point interest change from those in effect during fiscal would not have resulted in a fluctuation of interest income 
in fiscals and  the interest income we earned was immaterial and we did not have any significant debt 
foreign currency risk as of the end of fiscal  all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in us dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our business are food and labor costs 
some of our food costs are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices 
volatility in the commodity markets such as the wheat and dairy markets can have an adverse impact on our results from operations 
some of our hourly personnel at our restaurants are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage will directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
historically  inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operation
