item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us or may be available only on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including state regulatory requirements  our ability to write new business successfully  and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
if we have to raise additional capital  equity or debt financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  there could be dilution to our stockholders and the securities may have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to the common stock 
in the case of debt financings  we may be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to freely operate our business 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to implement our future growth or operating plans and our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and disruption that have negatively affected market liquidity conditions 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and limited the availability of credit for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
as a result  we may be forced to delay raising capital or be unable to raise capital on favorable terms  or at all  which could decrease our profitability  significantly reduce our financial flexibility  and cause rating agencies to reevaluate our financial strength ratings 
we are a holding company with no direct operations 
we depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us to meet our obligations  and our insurance subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us is restricted by law 
ehi is a holding company that transacts substantially all of its business through operating subsidiaries 
its primary assets are the shares of stock of our insurance subsidiaries 
the ability of ehi to meet obligations on outstanding debt  to pay stockholder dividends and to make other payments  depends on the surplus and earnings of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds  and upon the ability of our insurance subsidiaries  to pay dividends to egi and  in turn  the ability of egi to pay dividends to ehi 
payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds  and could be subject to contractual restrictions in the future  including those imposed by indebtedness we may incur in the future  see item business regulation financial  dividend and investment restrictions and note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we may not be able to receive dividends from these subsidiaries and we may not receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock 
we have outstanding indebtedness  which could impair our financial strength ratings and adversely affect our ability to react to changes in our business and fulfill our debt obligations 
our indebtedness could have significant consequences  including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations  limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  the execution of our business strategy  acquisitions  and other purposes  affecting the way we manage our business due to restrictive covenants  requiring us to provide collateral which restricts our use of funds  requiring us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  and making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions  and limiting our flexibility to plan for  and react quickly to  changing conditions 
we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems or cyber attacks on our systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  administer and make payments on claims  facilitate collections  and to automatically underwrite and administer the policies we write 
the failure of any of our systems could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business 
our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  and we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
certain events outside of our control  including cyber attacks on our systems  could render our systems inoperable such that we would be unable to service our agents  insureds  and injured workers  or meet certain regulatory requirements 
if such an event were to occur and our systems were unable to be restored or secured within a reasonable timeframe  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
additionally  cyber attacks  resulting in a breach of security  could jeopardize the privacy  confidentiality  and integrity of our data or our customers data  which could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
acts of terrorism and catastrophes could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
under our workers compensation policies and applicable laws in the states in which we operate  we are required to provide workers compensation benefits for losses arising from acts of terrorism 
the impact of any terrorist act is unpredictable  and the ultimate impact on us would depend upon the nature  extent  location  and timing of such an act 
we would be particularly adversely affected by a terrorist act affecting any metropolitan area where our policyholders have a large concentration of workers 
notwithstanding the protection provided by the reinsurance we have purchased and any protection provided by the act  or its extension  the tripra  the risk of severe losses to us from acts of terrorism has not been eliminated because our excess of loss reinsurance treaty program contains various sub limits and exclusions limiting our reinsurers obligation to cover losses caused by acts of terrorism 
our excess of loss reinsurance treaties do not protect against nuclear  biological  chemical  or radiological events 
if such an event were to impact one or more of the businesses we insure  we would be entirely responsible for any workers compensation claims arising out of such event  subject to the terms of the act  and the tripra see item business regulation federal legislative changes and could suffer substantial losses as a result 
our operations also expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes because we may be required to pay benefits to workers who are injured in the workplace as a result of a catastrophe 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  either natural or man made 
any catastrophe occurring in the states in which we operate could expose us to potentially substantial losses and  accordingly  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
administrative proceedings or legal actions involving our insurance subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance subsidiaries are involved in various administrative proceedings and legal actions in the normal course of their insurance operations 
our subsidiaries have responded to the actions and intend to defend against these claims 
these claims concern issues including eligibility for workers compensation insurance coverage or benefits  the extent of injuries  wage determinations  and disability ratings 
adverse decisions in multiple administrative proceedings or legal actions could require us to pay significant amounts in the aggregate or to change the manner in which we administer claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is largely dependent on the efforts of our management because of its industry expertise  knowledge of our markets  and relationships with the independent agents and brokers that sell our products 
our success depends in substantial part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers  experienced underwriting personnel  and other skilled employees who are knowledgeable about our business 
the current success of our business is dependent in significant part on the efforts of douglas d 
dirks  our president and chief executive officer  and william e 
yocke  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
many of our regional and local officers are also critical to our operations because of their industry expertise  knowledge of our markets  and relationships with the independent agents and brokers who sell our products 
we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our key executives 
currently  we maintain key man life insurance for our chief executive officer 
if we were to lose the services of members of our management team or key regional or local officers  we may be unable to find replacements satisfactory to us and our business 
as a result  our operations may be disrupted and our financial performance may be adversely affected 
assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds  second injury funds  and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce our profitability 
all states require insurance companies licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of insolvent insurance companies 
these obligations are funded by assessments that can be expected to continue in the future in the states in which we operate 
many states also have laws that established second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury  which are funded by either assessments based on paid losses or premium surcharge mechanisms 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in some states  insurance companies are required to participate in mandatory workers compensation shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements  which provide workers compensation insurance coverage from private insurers 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory shared market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business 
state insurance laws  certain provisions of our charter documents  and nevada corporation law could prevent or delay a change of control that could be beneficial to us and our stockholders 
our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in florida  california  and nevada 
the insurance laws of these states generally require that any person seeking to acquire control of a domestic insurance company obtain the prior approval of the state s insurance commissioner 
in florida  control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
in california and nevada  control is presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or of any entity that controls a domestic insurance company 
in addition  insurance laws in many states in which we are licensed require pre notification to the state s insurance commissioner of a change in control of a non domestic insurance company licensed in those states 
because we have insurance subsidiaries domiciled in florida  california  and nevada  any future transaction that would constitute a change in control of us would generally require the party acquiring control to obtain the prior approval of the insurance commissioners of these states and may require pre notification of the change of control 
the time required to obtain these approvals may result in a material delay of  or deter  any such transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals or tender offers  and may delay  deter  or prevent a change of control  even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws could discourage  delay  or prevent a merger  acquisition  or other change in control of us  even if our stockholders might consider such a change in control to be in their best interests 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
in particular  our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated by laws include provisions dividing our board of directors into three classes  eliminating the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  permitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series  imposing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at the stockholder meetings  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  thereby limiting stockholder action to that taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and providing our board of directors with exclusive authority to adopt or amend our by laws 
these provisions may make it difficult for stockholders to replace directors and could have the effect of discouraging a future takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors  but which stockholders might consider favorable 
additionally  these provisions could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including the risks described in the sections entitled risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a nevada holding company 
through our insurance subsidiaries  we provide workers compensation insurance coverage to select  small businesses in low to medium hazard industries 
workers compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees medical  disability  vocational rehabilitation  and or death benefit costs for work related injuries or illnesses 
we provide workers compensation insurance in states and the district of columbia  with a concentration in california 
our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned  net investment income  and net realized gains on investments 
we target small businesses  as we believe that this market is traditionally characterized by fewer competitors  more attractive pricing  and stronger persistency when compared to the us workers compensation insurance industry in general 
we believe we are able to price our policies at levels which are competitive and profitable over the long term 
our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at an appropriate and competitive price without sacrificing long term profitability and stability for short term top line revenue growth 
results of operations overall  net income was million  million  and million in   and  respectively and we recognized underwriting losses income of million  million  and million for the same periods  respectively 
underwriting loss income is determined by deducting losses and lae  commission expense  policyholder dividends  and underwriting and other operating expenses from net premiums earned 
key factors that affected our financial performance over the last three years  include gross premiums written declined from to and increased from to  net premiums earned declined from to and increased from to  losses and lae decreased in compared to and increased in compared to  current accident year loss estimate increased to in  from in and in  underwriting and other operating expenses declined from to and from to  and income tax expenses declined from million in to million in  while we had an income tax benefit of million in we measure our performance by our ability to increase stockholders equity  including the impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement deferred gain  over the long term 
the following table shows our stockholders equity  including the deferred gain  stockholders equity on a gaap basis  and number of common shares outstanding at december in thousands  except share data stockholders equity including the deferred gain gaap stockholders equity common shares outstanding stockholders equity  including the deferred gain  is a non gaap measure that is defined as total stockholders equity plus the deferred gain  which we believe is an important supplemental measure of our capital position 
our goal is to maintain our focus on disciplined underwriting and to continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities across market cycles  however  we continue to be affected by the impacts of the most recent economic recession 
the pace of recovery remains persistently slow and  although it appears to us that total employment and payroll have begun to improve  we do not believe the situation will significantly improve in the near term 
the comparative components of net income are set forth in the following table 
years ended december  in thousands net premiums earned net investment income realized gains on investments  net other income total revenues losses and lae commission expense policyholder dividends underwriting and other operating expenses interest expense income tax expense benefit total expenses net income less impact of the deferred gain net income before impact of the deferred gain we define net income before impact of the deferred gain as net income less a amortization of deferred gain and b adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
deferred gain reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income before impact of the deferred gain is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap  but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes or net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of the deferred gain because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction  under which the deferred gain does not result in ongoing cash benefits  and  consequently  we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that changes the definition of acquisition costs which may be capitalized beginning in we currently estimate that our underwriting and other operating expenses will be increased by approximately million in as a result of the adoption of this new accounting guidance 
additional information regarding this change is set forth under new accounting standards 
net premiums earned net premiums earned increased million for the year ended december   compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to increasing policy count as we continue to execute our growth strategy 
the change in the accrual for final audit premiums increased our net premiums earned by million in  compared to changes in the accrual for final audit premium are driven by various factors  including general economic conditions such as unemployment and payroll trends 
the decrease in net premiums earned for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  was due to the impacts of the recession  including high unemployment and fewer hours worked  declines in our policyholders payroll  lower net rates  and our application of disciplined pricing objectives and underwriting guidelines in a highly competitive market 
the following table shows the percentage change in our in force premium  policy count  average policy size  and payroll exposure  upon which our premiums are based  and net rate 
as of december  percentage increase decrease over percentage increase decrease over in force premium in force policy count average in force policy size in force payroll exposure net rate net rate  defined as total premium in force divided by total insured payroll exposure  is a function of a variety of factors  including rate changes  underwriting risk profiles and pricing  and changes in business mix related to economic and competitive pressures 
over one half of our business is generated in california  where our policy count increased during the year ended december  we set our own premium rates in california based upon actuarial analyses of current and anticipated loss trends with a goal of maintaining underwriting profitability 
due to increasing loss costs  primarily medical cost inflation  we have increased our filed premium rates by a cumulative since february  we expect that premiums in will continue to reflect overall rate increases  increasing policy count as we continue to execute our growth strategy  increasing average policy size  and lessened competitive pressures 
as we have executed our growth strategy  we have increased our network of independent insurance agencies by approximately in and continued to deploy technology to make it easier for agents to do business with us 
net investment income and realized gains losses on investments we invest our holding company assets  statutory surplus  and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities  including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and lae 
we invest in fixed maturity securities  equity securities  short term investments  and cash equivalents 
net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities  less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees 
we have established a high quality short duration bias in our investment portfolio 
net investment income was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in net investment income over the past three years was primarily related to a decrease in the average pre tax book yield on invested assets and a decrease in average invested assets over this period 
the decrease in average invested assets was primarily due to repayment of debt and the return of capital to stockholders through share repurchases and stockholder dividends 
the average pre tax book yield on invested assets was   and at december    and  respectively  while the tax equivalent yield on invested assets was   and as of the same dates  respectively 
realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original or adjusted cost equity securities or amortized cost fixed maturity securities 
realized losses are also recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment 
realized gains on investments were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in realized gains on investments for the year ended december  compared to resulted from a strategic rebalancing of our investment portfolio in an effort to increase portfolio allocations to taxable fixed income sectors  shorten portfolio duration following the decline in interest rates in the second half of  and an increase the allocation to high dividend equity securities 
we also evaluated our portfolio allocation during the fourth quarter of and elected to shift million of our equity securities into a high dividend yield portfolio  which resulted in a million gain 
additional information regarding our investments is set forth under liquidity and capital resources investments 
combined ratio the combined ratio  expressed as a percentage  is a key measurement of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio  policyholder dividends ratio  and underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
when the combined ratio is below  we have recorded underwriting income  and conversely  when the combined ratio is greater than  we cannot be profitable without investment income 
because we only have one operating segment  holding company expenses are included in our calculation of the combined ratio 
the following table provides the calculation of our calendar year combined ratios 
years ended december  loss and lae ratio underwriting and other operating expenses ratio commission expense ratio policyholder dividends ratio combined ratio loss and lae ratio 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
we analyze our loss and lae ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis 
a calendar year loss and lae ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and lae incurred during the calendar year  regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred  by the net premiums earned during that calendar year 
the calendar year loss and lae ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and lae established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years 
a calendar year loss and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
the calendar year loss and lae ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods 
the accident year loss and lae ratio  or losses and lae for insured events that occurred during a particular year divided by the premiums earned for the year  is calculated by dividing the losses and lae  regardless of when such losses and lae are incurred  for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year 
the accident year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
the accident year loss and lae ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably  and is an operating ratio based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our gaap financial information 
we analyze our calendar year loss and lae ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and lae from all periods  including development whether favorable or unfavorable of reserves established in prior periods 
in contrast  we analyze our accident year loss and lae ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and lae from insured events occurring during that year 
the loss and lae ratios provided in this report are calendar year basis  except where they are expressly identified as accident year loss and lae ratios 
losses and lae represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made  amortization of the deferred gain  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods  and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
the quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and lae  which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques 
in california  we are experiencing an increase in indemnity claims frequency the number of indemnity claims expressed as a percentage of payroll 
our loss experience also indicates an upward trend in medical and indemnity costs that are reflected in our current accident year loss estimate 
we are seeing increased medical and indemnity costs in many of our other states  partially offset by long term favorable loss cost trends in nevada 
we believe our current accident year loss estimate is adequate  however  ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for several years 
we assume that increasing medical and indemnity cost trends will continue to impact our long term claims costs and current accident year loss estimate 
additional information regarding our reserves for losses and lae is set forth under critical accounting policies reserves for losses and lae 
overall  losses and lae were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss estimate  an increase in net earned premiums  and the impact of favorable prior accident year loss development in prior accident year loss development in is entirely related to our assigned risk business 
the decrease in losses and lae from to was primarily due to lower payroll exposures 
additionally  favorable prior accident year loss development decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of our accident year loss estimates were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the accident year loss estimate for the year ended december  excludes a million expense related to the commutation of certain reinsurance treaties and a million expense related to the write off of certain reinsurance recoverables 
the increase in the current accident year loss estimate in is primarily due to continuing increases in loss costs in california

underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
the underwriting and other operating expenses ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expenses to net premiums earned and measures an insurance company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting  and administering its insurance business 
underwriting and other operating expenses are those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue  excluding commission 
these expenses include premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with  and are primarily related to  producing new or renewal business 
other underwriting expenses include changes in estimates of future write offs of premiums receivable  general administrative expenses such as salaries and benefits  rent  office supplies  depreciation  and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately 
policy acquisition costs are variable based on premiums earned  however  other operating costs are more fixed in nature and become a smaller percentage of net premiums earned as premiums increase 
in january  we restructured our operations as a result of the acquisition of amcomp incorporated in the acquisition and incurred one time pre tax integration and restructuring charges of approximately million  including million of severance benefits  for the year ended december  in the first quarter of  we incurred charges of million related to staffing reductions to adjust our insurance operations to reflect activity levels at that time 
in july  we announced the reorganization of our operations to eliminate duplicative services and better align resources with business activity and growth opportunities at that time 
in connection with those efforts and with general cost control efforts  we eliminated approximately positions 
in conjunction with that reorganization  we recorded restructuring charges of million in  including million related to workforce reductions and million related to leases for facilities that were vacated during the year 
underwriting and other operating expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  reflecting efforts to manage our expenses 
during the year ended december   compensation and facilities related expenses declined million and million  respectively  partially offset by a million increase in premium taxes and assessments  compared to the same period of underwriting and other operating expenses also included one time charges totaling million during for professional service fees related to acquisition due diligence activity 
excluding total restructuring items incurred in and the one time professional services fees incurred in  underwriting and other operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the million decrease in underwriting and other operating expense for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  includes restructuring items for both years 
excluding these restructuring charges  underwriting and other operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the decrease reflects efforts to manage our expenses during a period of declining premiums 
during the year ended december   information technology expenses declined million and compensation expenses declined million  compared to the same period of additionally  there was a million decrease in premium taxes and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
commission expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned and measures the cost of compensating agents and brokers for the business we have underwritten 
commission expense includes direct commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us  as well as incentive payments  other marketing costs  and fees 
commission expense is net of contingent profit commission income related to the lpt agreement 
the contingent profit is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and lae and expected paid losses and lae under the lpt agreement 
loss expenses are deemed to be of total losses paid and are paid to us as compensation for management of the lpt claims 
the calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning june  for the first twenty five years of the agreement 
the reinsurers pay us of any favorable difference between the actual and expected amounts paid at each calculation point 
conversely  we could be required to return any previously paid contingent profit commission  plus interest  in the event of unfavorable differences 
we accrue the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through june  increases or decreases in the estimated contingent profit commission are reflected in commission expense in the period that the estimate is revised 
we increased the estimated contingent profit commission by million and million in and  respectively  resulting in a decrease in the commission expense for those years 
for the year ended december   we decreased commission expenses by million as a result of an increase in contingent profit commissions and received cash payment of million from the reinsurers 
at december   expected amounts to be paid for losses under the lpt agreement for the period july  through june   were million  compared to contractually expected losses and lae of approximately million 
our commission expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to increased net premiums earned 
the increase from to was primarily due to a million adjustment in the accrual for the lpt contingent profit commission during the year ended december  and re negotiation of the terms of a separate reinsurance agreement resulting in an additional million in commission expense in the fourth quarter of this increase was partially offset by lower net premiums earned and a million reduction in the estimate of certain administrative fees due to anthem under our joint marketing agreements  which decreased the commission expense in the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of the lpt contingent profit commission  the re negotiated reinsurance agreement  and the change in accrual for fees due anthem  commission expense would have been   and of net premiums earned for the years ended december    and  respectively 
policyholder dividends ratio 
the policyholder dividends ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of policyholder dividends to net premiums earned and measures the cost of returning premium to policyholders in the form of dividends 
in administered pricing states such as florida and wisconsin  insurance rates are set by state insurance regulators 
rate competition generally is not permitted and policyholder dividend programs are an important competitive factor in these states 
we offer dividend programs to eligible policyholders  under which a portion of the policyholders premium may be returned in the form of dividends 
florida statutes also require the return of the portion of policyholders premiums that are deemed to be excessive profits under florida law 
we account for these payments as policyholder dividends 
policyholder dividends were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
policyholder dividends fluctuate from time to time due to changes in premium levels on dividend policies and the eligibility of policyholders to receive dividend payments 
interest expense we incur interest expenses on notes payable 
we also had an interest rate swap agreement on our credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  which expired on september  interest expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily due to the expiration of the interest rate swap that was in place in the decrease in interest expense from to was primarily due to a million reduction in the principal balance on our credit facility with wells fargo in the fourth quarter of and the expiration of the interest rate swap in the third quarter of income tax expense income tax expense benefit was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
the decreased tax expense from through is primarily due to increases in tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax net income  which was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increases in tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax net income for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  and for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  were primarily due to decreases in pre tax income of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources parent company operating cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we are a holding company and our ability to fund our operations is contingent upon our insurance subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends up to the holding company 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
we require cash to pay stockholder dividends  repurchase common stock  make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations  fund our operating expenses  and support our growth strategy 
during  eicn and epic paid dividends of million and million  respectively  to employers group  inc egi  their immediate holding company  which were subsequently paid from egi to ehi 
based on reported capital  surplus  and dividends paid within the last months  the maximum dividends that may be paid by eicn and epic in without prior approval by the respective state insurance regulator are million and million  respectively 
as of december   the holding company had million of cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity securities maturing within the next months 
ten million dollars of our line of credit is payable on each of december  and december  we believe that the liquidity needs of the holding company over the next months will be met with cash  maturing investments  and dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
share repurchases 
in november  the ehi board of directors board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of the company s common stock from november  through june  the program 
in november  the board of directors authorized a million expansion of the program  to million  and extended the repurchase authority pursuant to the program through june  repurchases under the program may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice  and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
from inception of the program through december   we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock under the program at an average price of per share  including commissions  for a total of million 
outstanding debt 
in december  we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo amended credit facility under which we were provided with a million line of credit through december   b million line of credit from january  through december   c million line of credit from january  through december   d million line of credit from january  through december   and e million line of credit from january  through december  amounts outstanding bear interest at a rate equal to  at our option a a fluctuating rate of above prime rate or b a fixed rate that is above the libor rate then in effect 
the amended credit facility is secured by fixed maturity securities and restricted cash and cash equivalents that had a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amended credit facility contains customary non financial covenants and requires us to maintain million of cash and cash equivalents at all times at the holding company 
we are currently in compliance with all applicable covenants 
in accordance with the terms of the contract  we repaid million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility on december  our total outstanding debt was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
interest and fees on debt obligations and an interest rate swap totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our capital structure is comprised of outstanding debt and stockholders equity 
as of december   our capital structure consisted of a million principal balance on our amended credit facility  million in surplus notes maturing in  and million of stockholders equity  including the deferred gain 
outstanding debt was of total capitalization  including the deferred gain  as of december  operating subsidiaries operating cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
the primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are funds generated from underwriting operations  investment income  and maturities and sales of investments 
the primary uses of cash are payments of claims and operating expenses  purchases of investments  and payments of dividends to the parent holding company  which are subject to state insurance laws and regulations 
our insurance subsidiaries had total cash and cash equivalents and fixed maturity securities of million maturing within the next months at december  we believe that our subsidiaries liquidity needs over the next months will be met with cash from operations  investment income  and maturing investments 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through june  the reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in five layers of coverage 
our reinsurance coverage is million in excess of our million retention on a per occurrence basis  subject to a million annual aggregate deductible and certain exclusions 
we believe that our reinsurance program meets our needs and that we are sufficiently capitalized 
our insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the amount of capital in our insurance subsidiaries is maintained relative to standardized capital adequacy measures such as risk based capital rbc  as established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc standard was designed to provide a measure by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company s capital and surplus relative to its operations 
an insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least of rbc 
each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum rbc requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action at december  various state regulations require us to keep securities or letters of credit on deposit with the states in which we do business 
securities having a fair market value of million and million were on deposit at december  and  respectively 
these laws and regulations govern both the amount and type of fixed maturity security that is eligible for deposit 
additionally  certain reinsurance contracts require us to hold funds in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we assumed 
the fair value of securities held in trust for reinsurance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash flows we monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs  making adjustments to our forecasts as appropriate 
the table below shows our net cash flows 
years ended december  cash and cash equivalents provided by used in in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
major components of net cash provided by operating activities in included net premiums received of million  investment income received of million  and amounts recovered from reinsurers of million 
these were partially offset by claims payments of million  underwriting and other operating expenses paid of million  commissions paid of million  premium taxes paid of million  and policyholder dividends paid of million 
major components of net cash provided by operating activities in were net premiums received of million and investment income received of million  partially offset by claims payments of net of reinsurance recoverables  underwriting and other operating expenses paid of million  and federal income taxes paid of million

investing activities 
the major sources of net cash provided by investing activities in were the sale of certain fixed maturity securities and from maturities and redemptions of other investments during the year 
in  net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to the reinvestment of funds from maturities and redemptions 
net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily due to maturities and redemptions of investments during the year 
financing activities 
the majority of cash used in financing activities in and was to repurchase million and million of our common stock  respectively  and to pay dividends to stockholders 
additionally  cash was used to pay down million on the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility in in  the majority of cash used in financing activities was to repurchase million of our common stock and to pay down million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility 
investments the amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair value was billion as of december  we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and considers the durations of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures  other liabilities  and capital needs 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and use excess cash to invest in operations  invest in marketable securities  return capital to our stockholders  and fund our growth strategy 
as of december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  consisted of fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate due to interest rate changes 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of at december  to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield  and credit risk 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be aa 
during the third quarter of  us treasuries  us agencies  and us agency backed securities were downgraded to aa by standard poor s s p  from aaa 
the percentage of our fixed maturity portfolio that was rated aaa declined by percentage points  to  year over year as of december  primarily due to this downgrade  however  our fixed maturity securities portfolio continued to have a weighted average quality of aa as of december   with of the market value rated aa or better 
we carry our portfolio of equity securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
we minimize our exposure to equity price risk by investing primarily in the equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
equity securities represented of our investment portfolio at december  given the economic uncertainty and continued market volatility  we believe that our asset allocation best meets our strategy to preserve capital for policyholders  to provide sufficient income to support insurance operations  and to effectively grow book value over a long term investment horizon 
we seek to maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio management 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning asset management conning to act as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by the board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize the investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized to develop portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn are used in constructing an optimal portfolio

we regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management  including the identification of other than temporary declines in fair value 
our other than temporary assessment includes reviewing the extent and duration of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost  historical and projected financial performance and near term prospects of the issuer  the outlook for industry sectors  credit rating  and macro economic changes 
we also make a determination as to whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before its fair value recovers above cost  or to maturity 
based on our review of fixed maturity and equity securities  we believe that we appropriately identified the declines in the fair values of our unrealized losses at december  and we determined that the unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of prevailing interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers 
the fixed maturity securities whose fair value was less than amortized cost were not determined to be other than temporarily impaired given the severity and duration of the impairment  the credit quality of the issuers  the company s intent on not selling the securities  and a determination that it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the securities until fair value recovers to above cost  or to maturity 
based on reviews of the equity securities as of december   the company recognized total impairments of million in the fair values of four equity securities as a result of the severity and duration of the change in fair values of those securities 
we also determined that the unrealized losses on equity securities at december  were not considered to be other than temporary due to the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuers

the losses and lae reserves are presented gross of reinsurance recoverables for unpaid losses  which were as follows for each of the periods presented above recoveries due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands reinsurance recoverables estimated losses and lae reserve payment patterns have been computed based on historical information 
our calculation of loss and lae reserve payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our reserving process  see critical accounting policies reserves for losses and lae 
actual payments of losses and lae by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of losses and lae reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts due to variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  but we believe that the following matters are particularly important to an understanding of our financial statements because changes in these estimates or changes in the assumptions used to make them could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
reserves for losses and lae accounting for workers compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and lae loss reserves as of a balance sheet date 
loss reserve estimates are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount we pay for many of the claims we have incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years 
our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and lae of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid 
we establish loss reserves based on our own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projections 
our aggregate carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae is the sum of our reserves for each accident year point estimate and represents our best estimate of outstanding loss reserves 
the amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development 
reserve development is unfavorable when losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims  causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be deficient 
reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves  causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be redundant 
development is reflected in our operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and lae during the period in which it is recognized 
although claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more  we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money 
the three main components of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are case reserves  incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  and lae reserves 
when losses are reported to us  we establish  individually  estimates of the ultimate cost of the claims case reserves 
these case reserves are continually monitored and revised in response to new information and for amounts paid 
ibnr is an actuarial estimate of future payments on claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
in addition to this provision for late reported claims  we also estimate  and make a provision for  the extent to which the case reserves on known claims may develop and for additional payments on closed claims  known as reopening 
ibnr reserves apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period  rather than a specific claim 
most of our ibnr reserves relate to estimated future claim payments on recorded open claims 
lae reserves are our estimate of the future expenses of investigating  administering  and settling claims  including legal expenses that will be paid to manage claims that have occurred 
lae reserves are established in the aggregate  rather than on a claim by claim basis 
a portion of our obligations for losses and lae are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 
the amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and lae reserves includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance policies  as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the lpt agreement 
our reserve for unpaid losses and lae gross and net of reinsurance  including the main components of such reserves  were as follows as of december  in thousands case reserves ibnr lae gross unpaid losses and lae less reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae  gross net unpaid losses and lae we use actuarial methodologies to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of unpaid losses and lae 
management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions  among other factors  in establishing reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
judgment is required in the actuarial estimation of loss reserves  including the selection of various actuarial methodologies to project the following the ultimate cost of claims  the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data  industry data  and other benchmarks  the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations  and the weighting of differing reserve indications resulting from alternative methods and assumptions 
the adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through our claims management process and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims 
we retain an independent actuarial consulting firm consulting actuary to perform comprehensive studies of our liability for losses and lae on a semi annual basis 
the role of the consulting actuary is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates  as well as a point estimate  of our liability for unpaid losses and lae  and to present those results to our actuarial staff and to management 
in  we changed our consulting actuary 
prior to this change  the consulting actuary based its point estimate for eicn strictly on the basis of paid loss development methods 
beginning in  our new consulting actuary determined its point estimate for eicn based on a combination of methodologies  similar to those utilized for our other insurance subsidiaries  as described below 
while such a determination  based on a combination of methodologies is valid  this change in methodologies prevents direct year over year comparison of the consulting actuaries point estimates 
the new consulting actuary has provided us with a separate calculation for eicn that is based strictly on the historically utilized paid loss methods 
this calculation in combination with the new consulting actuary s point estimate for our other insurance subsidiaries allows for comparability of our overall carried reserves  relative to the previous consulting actuary s calculations 
management believes that using strictly paid loss methods for nevada losses is the preferred approach given our depth of knowledge of nevada losses and the consistency of paid data over time resulting from and related to the statutory prohibition of entering into full and final settlements of nevada claims 
we compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year or quarter in which the claim occurred accident year or accident quarter when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time 
additionally  claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims or claimant benefits  or for different states or groups of states in which we do business  or both 
our internal actuaries and the consulting actuary prepare reserve estimates for all accident years using our own historical claims data and many of the generally accepted actuarial methodologies for estimating loss reserves  such as paid loss development methods  incurred loss development methods  and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
these methods vary in their responsiveness to different information  characteristics and dynamics in the data  and the results assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data 
the methods employed for each segment of claims data  and the relative weight accorded to each method  vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims 
each actuarial methodology requires the selection and application of various parameters and assumptions 
the key parameters and assumptions include the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  claims cost inflation rates  the effects of legislative benefit changes and or judicial changes  and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
we believe the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time and claims cost inflation rates are the most important parameters and assumptions 
in nevada  one method involves adjusting historical data for inflation 
the inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year to year movements in the cost of claims observed in our insurance subsidiaries data and industry wide data  as well as on broader inflation indices 
the results of this method would differ if different inflation rates were selected 
in projections using december  data  the method that uses explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation assumptions ranging from to 
the selection of medical cost inflation assumptions used has been based on observed recent and longer term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the us economy more generally 
the rate of medical cost inflation  as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
the rate of medical cost inflation in the general us economy  as measured by the consumer price index medical care  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
management along with internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary separately analyze lae and estimate unpaid lae 
these analyses rely primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amounts that have been spent on lae historically  compared with the volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods 
the portion of unpaid lae that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms 
the range of estimates of loss reserves produced by the consulting actuary is intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall 
this range is narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year 
the consulting actuary s point estimate of loss reserves is based on a judgmental selection for each claim segment from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods 
management formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis 
in doing so  we make reference to the most current analyses of our consulting actuary  including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used 
comprehensive studies are conducted as of june and december by both internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary 
on the alternate quarters  the results of the preceding quarter s studies are updated for actual claim payment activity by internal actuarial staff 
the aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
we believe that we should be conservative in our reserving practices due to the long tail nature of workers compensation claims payouts  the susceptibility of those future payments to unpredictable external forces such as medical cost inflation and other economic conditions  and the actual variability of loss reserve adequacy that we have observed in the workers compensation insurance industry 
in establishing management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december for the last three years  management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered the following a the consulting actuary s assumptions  point estimate  and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  and c the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of california workers compensation reforms 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for loss reserves that represented management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae in light of the historical data  actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  and current facts and circumstances 
management continued to use a range and point estimate for eicn based on paid loss methods  which our experience in nevada indicates is more appropriate 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was million  million  and million above the value calculated based on the historically utilized paid loss methods for eicn and a combination of methodologies for our other insurance subsidiaries at december    and  respectively 
the table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for net unpaid losses and lae and our carried reserves 
as of december  in thousands low end of actuarial range carried reserves high end of actuarial range the following table reconciles the changes in loss reserves

the increase in the estimate of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events of prior years in was related to the company s assigned risk business  while the decreases in and were due to favorable development in those prior accident years 
the sources of favorable development include actual paid losses that were less than expected and the impact of new information on selected patterns of claims emergence and payment used in the projection of future loss payments 
new information includes our own data regarding patterns of claims emergence  development and payment that have been observed in the most recent periods  and external information regarding the workers compensation environments in the states in which we operate 
as of december   california and nevada represented approximately of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae on our consolidated balance sheet 
in california  where our operations began in  the actuaries and management s initial expectations of ultimate losses and patterns of loss emergence and payment were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in california 
no historical data from our california insurance subsidiary existed prior to july   however  some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in california  but was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available 
the industry based benchmarks were judgmentally adjusted for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes  specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in california 
the actual emergence and payment of claims by our california insurance subsidiary has been more favorable than those initial expectations through  due at least in part to the impact of enactment of the major changes in the california workers compensation environment  however  our recent loss experience  beginning in  indicates an upward trend in medical costs that is reflected in our loss reserves 
we assume that increasing medical cost trends will continue and will impact our long term claims costs and loss reserves 
in nevada  we have compiled a lengthy history of workers compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the nevada state industrial insurance system the fund and eicn  but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long term history in nevada with the fund 
the expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long and short term historical data 
in recent evaluations  claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short term historical data 
consequently  our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years 
our insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period characterized by changing environmental conditions in our major markets  entry into new markets  and operational changes 
during periods characterized by such changes  at each evaluation  the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long term historical and recent company data  external data  evaluations of environmental and operational changes  and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and lae  the parameters to incorporate in those methods  and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications 
at each evaluation  management has given weight to new data  recent indications  and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management s expectation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes  compared with long term claim payment  claims emergence  and claim cost inflation patterns 
more than of our claims payments during the three years ended december  related to medical care for injured workers 
the utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers compensation 
our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods  some of which do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates  however  because medical care may be provided to an injured worker over many years  and in some cases decades  the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments 
for example  if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at december   we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately million on a net of reinsurance basis 
the range of estimates of unpaid losses and lae produced by our actuarial reviews of medical cost inflation data provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and lae payments  however  the full range of potential variation is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate 
our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims  but do not assume any losses resulting from significant new legal liability theories 
our reserve estimates also assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment 
in the event of significant new legal liability theories or new regulation or legislation  we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business 
if the actual unpaid losses and lae were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range  the impact on our financial results would have been as follows december  increase decrease in reserves in thousands at low end of range at high end of range increase decrease in equity and net income  net of income tax effect at low end of range at high end of range actual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or actuarial methodology can represent  and each methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics 
none of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods 
at any given evaluation date  some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the consulting actuary s selected range 
accordingly  we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes 
we increased our prior years reserves for unpaid losses and lae by million as of december   while we decreased our prior years reserves for unpaid losses and lae by million and million as of december  and  respectively  illustrating that changes in estimates of loss reserves can be significant from year to year 
we have no basis for anticipating whether actual future payments of losses and lae may be either greater than or less than the reserve for unpaid losses and lae currently on our balance sheet 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent a amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  b amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses  and c amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr for losses and lae 
these recoverables are based on our current estimates of the underlying losses and lae  and are reported on our consolidated balance sheets separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders 
we bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
reinsurers may refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condition and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
no material amounts due from reinsurers have been written off as uncollectible since our inception in  and we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july  for consideration of million in cash 
the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were million as of december  losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled million at december  we account for the lpt agreement as retroactive reinsurance 
entry into the lpt agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain that was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability 
this deferred gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
the contingent profit is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and lae and expected paid losses and lae as established in the lpt agreement 
the calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning june  for the first twenty five years of the agreement 
we are paid of the favorable difference between the actual and expected losses and lae paid at each calculation point 
each quarter  management records its best estimate of the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through june   which is impacted by estimates for ceded loss and lae reserves see reserves for losses and lae 
changes in estimates of the reserves ceded under the lpt agreement may significantly impact the accrued contingent profit commission on our consolidated balance sheet and commission expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
any changes in the estimated contingent profit commission are reflected in commission expense in the period that the estimate is revised 
recognition of premium revenue premium revenue is recognized over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
at the end of the policy term  payroll based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year 
earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums based on our historical experience 
these estimates are subject to changes in policyholders payrolls  economic conditions  and seasonality  and are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are included in current operations  however  they are partially offset by the resulting changes in losses and lae  commission expenses  and premium taxes 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment 
income taxes our accounting for income taxes considers the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements using the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change affects our net income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and various state tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
although we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
valuation of investments our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of equity  net of deferred taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income  net 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in operations on a specific identification basis 
fair values of our available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
these fair values are obtained primarily from third party pricing services  which generally use level or level inputs in accordance with fasb guidance 
the company obtains a quoted price for each security from third party pricing services  which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities 
for securities not actively traded  the third party pricing services may use quoted market prices of similar instruments or discounted cash flow analyses  incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities 
inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  broker quotes  benchmark yields  credit spreads  default rates  and prepayment speeds 
the company also performs quarterly analysis on the prices received from third parties to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value  including confirming the fair values of these securities through observable market prices using an alternative pricing source 
if unusual fluctuations are noted in this review  the company may obtain additional information from other pricing services to validate the quoted price 
impairment of investment securities 
when  in the opinion of management  a decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is considered to be other than temporary  the equity security s cost is written down to its fair value at the time the other than temporary decline is identified 
the determination of an other than temporary decline for debt securities includes  in addition to other relevant factors  a presumption that if the fair value is below cost by a significant amount for a period of time  a bifurcation of the write down may be necessary 
if management has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  the investment is written down to its fair value and the entire impairment is recorded as a realized loss due to credit in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
if management does not have the intent to sell or will not be required to sell the debt security but does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the debt security  the amount of the other than temporary impairment is bifurcated between credit loss and other loss and recorded as a component of realized gains and losses and in other comprehensive income  respectively  in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
the amount of any write down is determined by the difference between the cost or amortized cost of the debt security and its fair value at the time the other than temporary decline is identified 
goodwill and other intangible assets we prepare a valuation analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
new accounting standards deferred policy acquisition costs in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu number  accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts  which is expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
this update changes the definition of acquisition costs which may be capitalized to specify costs which relate directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts  adds to the definition the concept of incremental costs  further restricts costs to be capitalized by identifying only those costs which may be capitalized  and requires additional granularity in the disclosures related to the type of acquisition costs capitalized during the period 
this guidance became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we expect to adopt this standard on a prospective basis and currently estimate that adoption of asu will increase our underwriting and other operating expenses by approximately million in other recent accounting guidance prior to december   additional accounting guidance had been issued that we either implemented during or will implement in future periods 
none of this guidance had or is expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
credit risk our fixed maturity securities portfolio is exposed to credit risk  which we attempt to manage through issuer and industry diversification 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in fixed maturity securities of a single issuer 
we also bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condition and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
interest rate risk investments the fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk  the risk of loss in fair value resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates  which we strive to limit by managing duration 
our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of at december  to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we continually monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our liquidity obligations 
sensitivity analysis the fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments are subject to potential losses in future earnings resulting from changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices 
our sensitivity analysis model uses a hypothetical change in market rates that reflects what we believe are reasonably possible near term changes in those rates covering a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any action that we may take to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
we use fair values to measure our potential loss in this model  which includes fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
for invested assets  we use modified duration modeling to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put  and interest rate reset features 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  excluding accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the estimated changes in fair values on our fixed maturity securities including short term investments  valued at billion as of december   based on specific changes in interest rates are as follows changes in interest rates estimated increase decrease in fair value in thousands  except percentages basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point decline basis point decline the most significant assessment of the effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on investment income would be based on fasb guidance related to accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  which requires amortization adjustments for mortgage backed securities 
the rates at which the mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities are prepaid  and therefore the average life of mortgage backed securities  can vary depending on changes in interest rates for example  mortgages are prepaid faster and the average life of mortgage backed securities falls when interest rates decline 
adjustments for changes in amortization are based on revised average life assumptions and would have an impact on investment income if a significant portion of our residential mortgage backed securities were purchased at significant discounts or premiums to par value 
as of december   the par value of our mortgage backed securities holdings was million 
amortized cost is of par value 
since a majority of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at a premium or discount that is significant as a percentage of par  an adjustment could have a significant effect on investment income  however  given the current economic conditions and prevailing interest rate environment  the rate of prepayments is unlikely to accelerate 
the mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio totaled of total investments as of december  agency backed residential mortgage pass throughs totaled million  or  of the residential mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio  and of the total portfolio as of december  equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses in the fair value of the equity securities we hold in our available for sale investment portfolio 
adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio would result in decreases in the fair value of our total assets 
we minimize our exposure to equity price risk by investing primarily in the equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
the table below shows the sensitivity of our equity securities to price changes as of december  cost fair value fair value decrease pre tax impact on total equity securities fair value increase pre tax impact on total equity securities in thousands total domestic equities effects of inflation inflation could impact our financial statements and results of operations 
our estimates for losses and lae include assumptions about the timing of closure and future payment of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above established reserves  we will be required to increase those reserves for losses and lae  reducing our earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we consider inflation in the reserving process by reviewing cost trends and our historical reserving results 
we also consider an estimate of increased costs in determining the adequacy of our rates  particularly as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are also impacted to a certain degree by inflation
