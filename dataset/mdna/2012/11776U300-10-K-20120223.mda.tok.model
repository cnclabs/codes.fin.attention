intellectual property and other proprietary rights in general  we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and through contractual arrangements 
however  we cannot be certain that our efforts will be effective to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to  or competitive with  those developed by us 
additionally  because a significant portion of our revenue relates to the sale of third party software products  we also rely on our partners  particularly microsoft  to appropriately protect their own intellectual property 
we currently have nine issued patents and one pending patent in the united states  and we have a number of registered trademarks in various jurisdictions 
we will continue to pursue appropriate protections for our intellectual property

risk factors 
as discussed under item of part i  business forward looking statements  our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in our forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results  cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
microsoft related risk factors due to the fact that we have historically provided software and services to customers building devices utilizing microsoft s windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems  as well as the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of microsoft windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems  microsoft has a significant direct and indirect influence on our business 
the following represent several microsoft related risk factors which may negatively impact our business and operating results 

table of contents if we do not maintain our oem and windows mobile distribution agreements with microsoft or if microsoft de emphasizes or divests itself from these areas of its business  our revenue would decrease and our business would be adversely affected 
we have oem distribution agreements oda s for software products for embedded systems with microsoft  which enable us to sell microsoft windows embedded operating systems to our customers in the united states  canada  the caribbean excluding cuba  mexico  the european union and the european free trade association 
these odas are effective through june  we have also entered into other odas with microsoft pursuant to which we are licensed to sell microsoft windows mobile operating systems to customers in north america  south america  central america  japan  taiwan  korea  europe  the middle east  and africa 
the odas to sell windows mobile operating systems are effective through june  and july  we generated million and million of revenue in and  respectively  through our sales of microsoft operating systems and expect this revenue stream to continue in if any of the odas are terminated by microsoft which microsoft can do unilaterally or not renewed  or if microsoft decides to no longer invest in or to divest itself from these areas of its business  our software revenue and resulting gross profit could decrease significantly and our operating results would be negatively impacted 
future renewals  if any  could be on less favorable terms  which could also negatively impact our business and operating results 
microsoft can change pricing under the odas at any time and recently announced a new pricing change for windows embedded operating systems which is currently scheduled to take effect march  microsoft could change its pricing structure again and  unless we are able to either pass through price increases to our customers or sign our customers to month purchasing commitments  which lowers the price we pay to microsoft  our revenue  gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted 
further  microsoft currently offers a rebate program in conjunction with our oda activities in which we earn money for achieving certain predefined objectives 
if microsoft were to eliminate or negatively modify the rebate program  our gross profit and operating results would be negatively impacted 
we earned rebate credits from microsoft of  and  in and  respectively 
microsoft has audited our records under the odas in the past and will likely audit our records again in the future and any negative audit results could result in additional charges and or the termination of the odas 
there are provisions in the odas that require us to maintain certain internal records and processes for royalty auditing and other reasons 
non compliance with these and other requirements could result in the termination of the odas 
microsoft has concluded an audits of our records pertaining to the oda in and  neither of which had material findings 
it is possible that future audits could result in charges due to any material findings that are found 
if we do not maintain our favorable relationship with microsoft  we will have difficulty marketing and selling our software and services and may not receive developer releases of windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems 
as a result  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
we maintain a strategic marketing relationship with microsoft 
if our relationship with microsoft deteriorates for any reason  including an increased focus by us on customers building devices utilizing non microsoft embedded or mobile operating systems  our efforts to market and sell our software and services to oems and others could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 
microsoft has significant influence over the development plans and buying decisions of oems and others utilizing windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems for smart devices and these targeted platforms are a significant focus for us 
microsoft provides customer referrals to us 
moreover  microsoft controls the marketing campaigns related to its operating systems 
microsoft s marketing activities  including trade shows  direct mail campaigns and print advertising  are important to the continued promotion and market acceptance of windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems and  consequently  to our sale of windows based software and services 
we 
table of contents must maintain a favorable relationship with microsoft to continue to participate in joint marketing activities with them  which includes participating in partner pavilions at trade shows  listing our services on microsoft s website  and receiving customer referrals 
in the event that we are unable to continue our joint marketing efforts with microsoft  or fail to receive referrals from them  we would be required to devote significant additional resources and incur additional expenses to market our software products and services directly to potential customers 
in addition  we depend on microsoft for developer releases of new versions of  and upgrades to  windows embedded and windows mobile software in order to facilitate timely development and delivery of our own software and services 
if we are unable to maintain our favorable relationship with microsoft and no longer continue receiving such new versions and updates  our revenue could decline significantly  and or our costs could increase significantly  thereby negatively impacting our operating results 
unexpected delays or announcement of delays by microsoft related to product releases of windows embedded and or windows mobile operating systems could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
unexpected delays or announcement of delays in microsoft s delivery schedule for new versions of its windows embedded and or windows mobile operating systems could cause us to delay our product introductions or impede our ability to sell our products and services and or to complete customer projects on a timely basis 
such delays  or announcements of delays  by microsoft could also cause our customers to delay or cancel their project development activities or product introductions  which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
if microsoft adds features to its windows operating systems or develops products that directly compete with products and services we provide  our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted 
as the developer of windows  windows embedded compact  windows embedded standard  windows server  windows embedded standard  windows embedded compact  and windows mobile operating systems  microsoft could add features which eliminate or reduce our customers need for our software and services  or microsoft could develop standalone products and services that compete with the products and services we provide to our customers 
the ability of our customers  or potential customers  to obtain products and services directly from microsoft that compete with our products and services could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
even if the standard features of future microsoft operating system software were more limited than our offerings  a significant number of our customers  and potential customers  might elect to accept more limited functionality in lieu of purchasing additional software from us or delay the purchase of our products and services while they perform a comparison of microsoft s competing offerings 
moreover  the resulting competitive pressures could lead to price reductions for our offerings and reduce our revenue and gross profit accordingly and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
if the markets for windows embedded and or windows mobile operating systems fail to develop further  develop more slowly than expected  or decline  our business and operating results may be materially harmed 
because a significant portion of our revenue to date has been generated by software and services targeted at customers and devices utilizing the windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems  if the markets for these systems or platforms fail to develop further  or develop more slowly than expected  or decline  our business and operating results could be negatively impacted 
market acceptance of windows embedded and windows mobile will depend on many factors  including microsoft s development and support of the windows embedded and windows mobile markets 
as the developer and primary promoter of windows embedded compact  windows embedded standard and windows mobile  if microsoft were to decide to discontinue or lessen its support of these operating systems and platforms  potential customers could select competing operating systems  which could reduce the demand for our windows embedded and windows mobile related software products and engineering services  from which a significant portion of our revenue is generated today  
table of contents the ability of the microsoft windows embedded and or windows mobile operating systems to compete against existing and emerging operating systems for the smart device market  including osx from apple  inc  vxworks and linux from windriver systems inc  android from google inc  blackberry from research in motion limited rim  and other proprietary operating systems 
in particular  in the market for rugged handheld devices  windows mobile faces intense competition from the android operating systems 
in the market for converged devices  windows embedded faces intense competition from the android operating system 
windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems may be unsuccessful in capturing a significant share of these segments of the smart device market  or in maintaining its market share in these segments  the acceptance by oems and consumers of the mix of features and functions offered by windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems  and the willingness of software developers to continue to develop and expand the applications that run on windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems 
to the extent that software developers write applications for competing operating systems that are more attractive to smart device users than those available on windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems  potential customers could select competing operating systems over windows embedded and windows mobile operating systems 
myford touch related risk factors if we do not obtain additional work on the myford touch program through our new statement of work with microsoft or elsewhere in the future our future revenue and gross profit would decrease and our operating results would be adversely affected 
we began working on the myford touch infotainment project with ford in the second quarter of and have been working on the program since then although the main program was completed in august since inception of the program through december   our contractual relationship was with ford 
effective january   our contractual relationship for the myford touch program shifted from ford to microsoft  as microsoft has become the primary vendor to ford for this program 
revenue from ford comprised million  or  of our total revenue in we expect this project work to continue in under our new statement of work with microsoft but expect revenue from the myford touch program to be lower  albeit still significant in  than it was in due to the lower level of personnel resources utilized on the program 
our new statement of work with microsoft currently runs through june  while expect to be actively involved in future projects with microsoft and ford beyond june   if our role on myford touch is scaled back or eliminated beyond that point our revenue and resulting gross profit would suffer and negatively impact our operating results 
if we breach our agreement with microsoft governing our work for ford  or fail to comply with the requirements of the agreement  or are required to perform warranty repairs on any of the ford vehicles into which our work is incorporated  or if any of those vehicles are recalled due to defects in our work  our revenue  operating results and overall business could be negatively impacted 
our agreement with microsoft governing our work for ford on the myford touch program provides customary representations and warranties and we accept liability for certain damages that are incurred as a result of our breach or failure to comply with the requirements of that agreement 
these damages may include consequential damages 
the agreement also provides that we will indemnify against certain third party claims 
in addition  warranty repairs on our work for ford could require us to devote additional hours that would not be billable 
a significant warranty claim could require immediate remediation and consume a large amount of our billable resources until it is fixed  which could negatively impact our revenue  operating results and our business 
in addition  if a defect were significant enough to require a vehicle recall  the costs of such a recall could be significant 
we have increased our overall insurance amounts  but many claims  including  but not limited to  warranty and recall related issues  may not be covered by insurance 

table of contents general business related risk factors our marketplace is extremely competitive  which may result in price reductions  lower gross profit margins and loss of market share 
the market for our software products and related services is extremely competitive 
increased competition may result in lower revenue  price reductions  lower gross profit and margin and loss of customers and market share  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we face competition from our current and potential customers internal research and development departments  which may seek to develop their own proprietary products and solutions that compete with our proprietary software products and engineering services  engineering service firms  including off shore development companies  such as adeneo  teleca and wipro  odms  particularly those in taiwan and china  which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings  contract manufacturers  which have added or are adding software development capabilities to their offerings  mobile and embedded test automation providers including perfecto mobile  mverify  jamo solutions  smartbear software automatedqa  testplant eggplant and keynote 
in this market we also compete against customers internally created tools and against manual testing  microsoft windows embedded operating system distributors such as arrow electronics  inc arrow and avnet  inc avnet  and microsoft windows mobile operating system distributors who began competing with us in our approved regions in such as avnet in the americas  synnex corporation in taiwan  and mds technology co  ltd in korea 
some of our competitors focus on only one aspect of our business or offer complementary products which can be integrated with our products 
as we develop and bring to market new software products and service offerings  particularly offerings focused on specific industries and or focused on devices utilizing non windows embedded operating systems  we may begin competing with companies with which we have not previously competed 
further  as we expand the geographic markets into which we sell our software solutions and related services  we may expect to increasingly compete with companies with which we have not previously competed 
it is also possible that new competitors will enter the market or that our competitors will form alliances  including alliances with microsoft  that may enable them to rapidly increase their market share 
microsoft has not agreed to any exclusive arrangement with us  nor has it agreed not to compete with us 
microsoft may decide to bring more of the core embedded development services and expertise that we provide in house  possibly resulting in reduced software and service revenue opportunities for us 
the barrier to entering the market as a provider of windows based smart device software and services is low 
in addition  microsoft has created marketing programs to encourage systems integrators to work on windows embedded and windows mobile operating system software and services 
these systems integrators are given substantially the same access by microsoft to the windows technology as we are 
new competitors may have lower overhead than we do and may be able to undercut our pricing 
we expect that competition will increase as other established and emerging companies enter the windows based smart device market  and as new products and technologies are introduced 
our ability to maintain or grow our proprietary software revenue is contingent on our ability to bring to market competitive  unique offerings that keep pace with technological changes and needs 
if we are not successful in doing so  our business would be negatively impacted 
proprietary software product sales provide us with much higher gross profit margins than we typically receive from third party software products and our engineering service offerings and provide other advantages as well 
increasing the number and amount of proprietary products we sell is an important part of our growth 
table of contents strategy 
our ability to maintain and increase the revenue contribution from proprietary software products is contingent on our ability to enhance the features and functionality of our current proprietary products as well as to devise  develop and introduce new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand the number of proprietary products that we sell  and our failure to do so could negatively impact revenue and our operating results 
we may experience delays in our efforts to develop new products and services  and these delays could cause us to miss market opportunities which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
the market for our software and services evolves rapidly 
as a result  the life cycles of our products and services are difficult to estimate 
to be successful  we believe we must continue to enhance our current offerings and provide new software and service offerings with attractive features  prices and terms that appeal to our customers 
we have experienced delays in new software and service offering introductions in the past and may do so again in the future 
our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted if we delay releases of new products  product enhancements and or new services offerings  or if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs or technical trends and are unable to introduce new products and service offerings into the market successfully 
in addition  our customers may defer or forego purchases of our products and or services if we  microsoft  our competitors or major hardware  systems or software vendors introduce or announce new products 
our future success depends upon our customers ability to successfully sell their products incorporating our technology  and to continue buying our services 
even if a customer selects us to provide software and services  the customer may not ultimately market and sell its product successfully 
a cancellation or change in plans by a customer  whether from lack of market acceptance of its products or otherwise  could cause us to lose revenue that we had anticipated and our revenue and operating results would suffer 
also  our revenue and operating results could suffer if a significant customer reduces or delays orders during our sales cycle or chooses not to release products that contain our technology 
if the market for smart devices grows more slowly than we expect  or declines  our revenue may not grow as anticipated  if at all  and our business would be harmed 
the market for smart devices is still in fluctuation and the potential size of this market and the timing of its development are not known 
as a result  our profit potential is uncertain and our revenue may not develop as anticipated 
we are dependent upon the broad acceptance and adoption by businesses and consumers of a wide variety of smart devices  which will depend on many factors  including the development of content and applications for smart devices  the willingness of large numbers of businesses and consumers to use devices such as smart phones  pdas and handheld industrial data collectors to perform functions historically carried out manually  or by traditional pcs  including inputting and sharing data  communicating among users and connecting to the internet  the evolution of industry standards or the necessary infrastructure that facilitate the distribution of content over the internet to these devices via wired and wireless telecommunications systems  satellite or cable  and the amount of discretionary funds companies and individuals have to spend for this kind of technology 

table of contents the success and profitability of our service offerings are contingent on our ability to differentiate these offerings adequately in the marketplace  which is  in turn  contingent on our ability to retain our engineering personnel and defend our billing rate structure against those of our competitors  including those using lower cost offshore resources 
if we are unable to do so successfully  our business could be harmed 
we are a leader in providing engineering services to smart device customers 
our market differentiation is created through several factors  including our experience with a variety of smart device platforms and applications 
our differentiation is contingent  in part  on our ability to attract and retain employees with this expertise  a significant portion of which are currently based in the united states 
to the extent we are unable to retain critical engineering services talent and or our competition is able to deliver the same services by using lower cost offshore resources  our service revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted 
the success and profitability of our service engagements are contingent upon our ability to scope and bid engagements and deliver our services profitably 
if we are unable to do so  our service revenue service gross profit margin and operating results could be negatively impacted 
various factors may cause the total cost of service projects to exceed the original estimate provided to the customer or the contractual maximum in the case of fixed price contracts  including specification changes  customer deliverable delays  inadequate scoping and inefficient service delivery 
if we are unable to adequately scope  bid and deliver on service engagements successfully  our service revenue  service gross margin and operating results could be negatively impacted 
in addition  depending on the cause of an overrun for a given customer and project  we may also decide to provide pricing concessions to that customer which could negatively impact our service revenue  service gross profit and operating results 
we periodically enter into engineering service agreements in which we have agreed to perform our engineering service work for lower up front fees  or for no fees  in exchange for future royalties or per unit fees 
there is no guarantee that these arrangements will produce the strategic or economic returns as anticipated 
we have entered into contracts that involve reducing or eliminating up front engineering service fees in return for a per device chip royalty or fee that is earned as our customers ship their devices or chips  and we may enter into more such agreements in the future 
because we are delaying revenue past the point where our services are performed  there is a risk that our customers may cancel their projects or that their devices or chips may not be successful in the market  which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
cooperation and support from silicon vendors is critical for the success of our products and related services that are developed for their particular silicon architecture 
such cooperation cannot be assured 
we have developed  and continue to develop  software and service offerings based on certain silicon architectures eg the ti omap architecture 
due to the nature of the industry we serve and the products we develop  it is necessary for us to make certain assumptions regarding which silicon vendors will be successful in the various markets we serve and upon which we are making investments 
it is therefore important that there is ongoing support from the svs in the marketplace for these silicon architectures 
for example  during the development of a reference design board  intel made a strategic decision to sell its pxa xscale division to marvell which negatively impacted the sale of our xscale based reference designs 
there can be no assurance that marvell  ti  or any of the other svs will continue to pursue and support the markets that we have been targeting 
if the svs do not support our efforts going forward  our revenue and operating results could be negatively impacted 

table of contents the long sales cycle of our products and services makes our revenue susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales cycle is typically three to nine months because the expense and complexity of the software and service offerings we sell generally require a lengthy customer approval process and may be subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the approval cycles for our customers may be longer due to economic uncertainties  the timing of budget cycles  and the timing of customers competitive evaluation processes 
in addition  to successfully sell our software and engineering service offerings  we must frequently educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our software and services  which can require significant time 
if our sales cycle further lengthens unexpectedly  it could adversely affect the timing of our revenue  which could cause our quarterly results to fluctuate 
erosion of the financial condition of our customers could adversely affect our business 
our business could be adversely affected if the financial condition of our customers erodes because such erosion could reduce demand from those customers for our software and engineering services 
this could also cause them to terminate their relationships with us  and or could increase the risk that such customers default on their payment obligations to us 
additionally  while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  economic trends may cause more companies to default or cease operations  in which case our allowances may not cover actual losses  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we may be subject to product liability claims that could result in significant costs 
our software license and service agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims with the notable exception of the portion of the myford touch project contracted with ford 
it is possible  however  that these provisions may be ineffective under the laws of certain jurisdictions or that our customers may not agree to these limitations 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products and services may be subject to such claims in the future 
there is a risk that any such claims or liabilities may exceed  or fall outside  the scope of our insurance coverage  and we may be unable to retain adequate liability insurance in the future 
a product liability claim brought against us  whether successful or not  could negatively impact our business and operating results 
negative business conditions  changes in useful lives  and other factors may negatively affect the carrying value of the intangible assets and goodwill we have acquired 
in the fourth quarter of  we purchased certain assets of testquest including acquired technology and other intangible assets with a total gross carrying value of million  and which have a carrying value of  as of december  in the third quarter of  we acquired mpc data limited including certain intangible assets with a carrying value of million and goodwill of million as of december  although we expect to generate cash from the intangible assets in the future  and do not foresee any impairment of our goodwill  it is possible that we may be required to reassess the carrying value of these assets in the future if certain negative business conditions occur such as negative results of our business associated with our intangible assets or a low stock price 
any reduction in the carrying value of these intangible assets or goodwill would result in an impairment charge that would negatively impact our operating results 
further  business conditions and other factors may also require us to reassess the useful lives associated with intangible assets 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we assessed that the net carrying value of the remaining intangible assets associated with acquired technology from testquest was impaired due to this technology no longer being used in our product offerings 
as such  we recognized an impairment charge of  as software cost of revenue which negatively impacted our gross profit and operating results 
past acquisitions have proven difficult to integrate  and recent or future acquisitions  if any  could disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value and negatively affect our operating results 
we have acquired the technologies  assets and or operations of other companies in the past and may acquire or make investments in companies  products  services and technologies in the future as part of our growth strategy 
if we fail to properly evaluate  integrate and execute on our acquisitions and investments  our business and prospects may be seriously harmed 
to successfully complete an acquisition  we must properly evaluate the technology  market and management team  accurately forecast the financial impact of the transaction  including accounting charges and transaction expenses  integrate and retain personnel  combine potentially different corporate cultures and effectively integrate products and research and development  sales  marketing and support operations 
if we fail to do any of these  we may suffer losses and impair relationships with our employees  customers and strategic partners 
additionally  management may be distracted from day to day operations 
we also may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  which are especially critical in light of sarbanes oxley and other corporate governance requirements  and significant demands may be placed on our management and our operations  information services and financial  legal and marketing resources 
finally  acquired businesses sometimes result in unexpected liabilities and contingencies  which may involve compliance with foreign laws  payment of taxes  labor negotiations or other unknown costs and expenses  which could be significant 
we may not be able to raise additional capital if required to support our business 
if we need to raise additional operating capital  we may find that our access to equity and debt capital markets is limited or blocked entirely 
in the past  our stock has traded at low volumes and overall investor confidence in the stock market could falter 
this could make it difficult or impossible to sell additional shares on the public markets 
in addition  it may be difficult and costly to obtain debt financing and we may be unable to borrow additional funds at acceptable cost  or at all  should the need arise 
if we are unable to raise capital as necessary  it may adversely affect our ability to invest in products or fund operations  which would materially harm our business and negatively affect operating results 
we are dependent on our insurance carriers to cover certain risks and a failure of one or more of our carriers  a tightening of the market that increases our costs or decreases our ability to obtain necessary coverage  or the denial of a claim could negatively impact our business 
we have added significant additional insurance to cover the additional exposure presented by our work for ford on the myford touch program and other customers 
while all of our insurance carriers appeared to be viable as of the date of this annual report  if this changes  or we are unable to maintain current coverage through viable insurance carriers at reasonable rates  or we are unable to obtain additional coverage that we deem necessary for our business  or if a carrier denies a claim  we may be unable to meet our financial obligations if claims that would otherwise have been covered by this insurance are made which could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 
taxing jurisdictions in the united states are becoming more aggressive with tax legislation and tax collection  particularly states facing significant budget deficits  which could expose us to additional tax liability that we have not been subject to in the past 
we make sales in many jurisdictions across the united states  most of which we do not have nexus in and  therefore  are not subject to sales  franchise  income and other state and local taxes 
particularly in light of state revenue deficits  taxing jurisdictions have become more aggressive in defining nexus  among other things  which 
table of contents could result in us achieving nexus  or potentially achieving nexus in significantly more tax jurisdictions 
if this occurs and unless we are able to pass through this cost to our customers  our tax expense will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations 
further  because state and local tax laws are becoming increasingly complex  our cost to monitor our state and local tax compliance will increase which will negatively affect our results of operations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we do not currently have unknown tax exposure in a state or local tax jurisdiction because of recent tax law changes which we are unaware of and the resulting liability could be significant and would negatively affect our results of operations 
there may be restrictions on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards due to a tax law ownership change 
section of the us internal revenue code restricts the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  and million of tax credit carryforwards 
under the applicable tax rules  an ownership change occurs if greater than five percent shareholders of an issuer s outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than percentage points over a rolling three year period 
we have performed analyses of possible ownership changes which included consideration of a third party study  and do not believe that an ownership change as defined by this section has occurred 
however  if a tax law ownership change has occurred of which we are not aware  or if a tax law ownership change occurs in the future  we may have to adjust the valuation of our deferred tax assets  and could be at risk of having to pay income taxes notwithstanding the existence of our sizable carryforwards 
further  to the extent that we have utilized our carryforwards from prior years  the existence of a previous tax law ownership change that we did not account for could result in liability for back taxes  interest  and penalties 
non compliance with our lease agreement could have a material adverse impact on our financial position 
under the terms of our corporate headquarters lease signed in february  if we default under the lease  the landlord has the ability to demand cash payments forgiven in the amount of the forgiven payments for which the landlord has the ability to demand repayment was  at december   and decreases on a straight line basis over the length of our ten year headquarters lease 
any breach of or non compliance with this lease agreement could negatively impact our business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property related risk factors our software and service offerings could infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  which could expose us to additional costs and litigation and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and services or cause shipment delays or stoppages 
it is difficult to determine whether our software and engineering services infringe third party intellectual property rights  particularly in a rapidly evolving technological environment in which technologies often overlap and where there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed 
if we were to discover that one of our software or service offerings  or a product based on one of our reference designs  violated a third party s proprietary rights  we may not be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  to continue offering that product or service 
similarly  third parties may claim that our current or future software products and services infringe their proprietary rights  regardless of whether such claims have merit 
any such claims could increase our costs and negatively impact our business and operating results 
in certain cases  we have been unable to obtain indemnification against claims that third party technology incorporated into our software products and services infringe the proprietary rights of others 
however  any indemnification we do obtain may be limited in scope or amount 
even if we receive broad third party indemnification  these entities may not have the financial capability to indemnify us in the event of infringement 
in addition  in some circumstances we are required to indemnify our customers for claims made against them that are based on our software products or services 
there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims 
table of contents related to the software products and services we provide  or arising from the incorporation by us of third party technology  and claims for indemnification from our customers resulting from such claims  will not be asserted or prosecuted against us 
some of our competitors have  or are affiliated  with companies with substantially greater resources than we have  and these competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could 
in addition  we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows  and as the functionality of products in different industry segments increasingly overlap 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources in addition to potential product redevelopment costs and delays 
furthermore  if we were unsuccessful in resolving a patent or other intellectual property infringement action claim against us  we may be prohibited from developing or commercializing certain of our technologies and products  or delivering services based on the infringing technology  unless we obtain a license from the holder of the patent or other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if such license is not obtained  we would be required to cease these related business operations  which could negatively impact our business  revenue and operating results 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase our costs 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitive position could be weakened and our revenue and operating results adversely affected 
we rely primarily on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions as well as a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  to protect our intellectual property 
these laws and procedures provide only limited protection 
it is possible that another party could obtain patents that block our use of some  or all  of our software and services 
if that occurred  we would need to obtain a license from the patent holder or design around those patents 
the patent holder may or may not choose to make a license available to us at all  or on acceptable terms 
similarly  it may not be possible to design around a blocking patent 
in general  there can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws will be effective to prevent misappropriation of our technology  or to prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with those developed by us 
we frequently license the source code of our software products and the source code results of our services to customers 
there can be no assurance that customers with access to our source code will comply with the license terms or that we will discover any violations of the license terms or  in the event of discovery of violations  that we will be able to successfully enforce the license terms and or recover the economic value lost from such violations 
to license some of our software products  we rely in part on shrinkwrap and clickwrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and  therefore  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
as with other software  our software products are susceptible to unauthorized copying and uses that may go undetected  and policing such unauthorized use is difficult 
a significant portion of our marks include the word bsquare 
other companies use forms of bsquare in their marks alone  or in combination with other words  and we cannot prevent all such third party uses 
we license certain trademark rights to third parties 
such licensees may not abide by our compliance and quality control guidelines with respect to such trademark rights 
any of these outcomes could negatively impact our brand  dilute its recognition in the marketplace  or confuse potential customers  all of which could harm our business 
the computer software market is characterized by frequent and substantial intellectual property litigation  which is often complex and expensive  and involves a significant diversion of resources and uncertainty of outcome 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property or to defend against a claim of infringement or invalidity 
litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and could negatively impact our business and operating results 

table of contents our software or hardware products or the third party hardware or software integrated with our products or delivered as part of our service offerings may suffer from defects or errors that could impair our ability to sell our products and services 
software and hardware components as complex as those needed for smart devices frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
we have had to delay commercial release of certain versions of our products until problems were corrected and  in some cases  have provided product enhancements to correct errors in released products 
some of our contracts require us to repair or replace products that fail to work 
to the extent that we repair or replace products our expenses may increase 
in addition  it is possible that by the time defects are fixed  the market opportunity may decline which may result in lost revenue 
moreover  to the extent that we provide increasingly comprehensive products and services  particularly those focused on hardware  and rely on third party manufacturers and suppliers to manufacture these products  we will be dependent on the ability of third party manufacturers to correct  identify and prevent manufacturing errors 
errors that are discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  diversion of development resources  damage to our reputation and increased service and warranty costs  all of which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
if we are unable to license key software from third parties  our business could be harmed 
we sometimes integrate third party software with our proprietary software and engineering service offerings or sell such third party software offerings on a standalone basis eg windows embedded operating systems under our oda with microsoft 
if our relationships with these third party software vendors were to deteriorate  or be eliminated in their entirety  we might be unable to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in the event that we are unable to obtain these third party software offerings  we would be required to develop this technology internally  assuming it was economically or technically feasible  or seek similar software offerings from other third parties assuming there were competing offerings in the marketplace  which could delay or limit our ability to introduce enhancements or new products  or to continue to sell existing products and engineering services  thereby negatively impacting our revenue and operating results 
governance related risk factors it might be difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
certain provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and washington law may discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of us or a change in our management  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
our board of directors has the authority under our amended and restated articles of incorporation to issue preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock 
as a result  preferred stock could be issued quickly and easily with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of our management more difficult 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes 
the directors in each class serve for three year terms  one class being elected each year by our shareholders 
this system of electing and removing directors may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company because it generally makes it more difficult for shareholders to replace a majority of our directors 
in addition  chapter of the washington business corporation act generally prohibits a target corporation from engaging in certain significant business transactions with a defined acquiring person for a period of five years after the acquisition  unless the transaction or acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s board of directors prior to the time of acquisition 
this provision may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of our company 
the existence of these anti takeover provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

table of contents international operations related risk factors our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property  management  collections  regulatory and other risks 
customers outside of north america generated of our total revenue in and in we have expanded rapidly internally during and including establishing presences in korea and china and our mpc acquisition in september which significantly increased our presence in emea 
we currently have operations outside of north america in taiwan  china and the united kingdom and also have a limited sales and or support presence in japan and south korea 
our international activities and operations  and our current expansion plans expose us to a number of risks  including the following greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property due to less stringent foreign intellectual property laws and enforcement policies  longer collection cycles than we typically experience in north america  unfavorable changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  compliance with complex regulatory regimes or restrictions on import and export of our goods and services  complex and or adverse tax laws and or changes thereto 
additionally  we may be subject to income  withholding and other taxes for which we may realize no current benefit despite the existence of significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the us  loss or reduction of withholding tax exemptions  the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies  general economic and political conditions in international markets which may differ from those in the us  increased exposure to potential liability under the foreign corrupt practices act  added cost and administrative burden associated with creating and operating business structures in other jurisdictions  potential labor costs and risks associated with employees and labor laws in other geographies  and the inherent risks of working in a certain highly regulated and or controlled economies where relationships between company management and government officials is critical to timely processing of approvals required to conduct business 
these risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial and managerial resources required to operate our foreign offices  as well as on our future international revenue  which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
as we increase the amount of software development conducted in non us locations  potential delays and quality issues may impact our ability to timely deliver our software and services  potentially impacting our revenue and profitability 
we conduct development activities in non us locations  primarily india through a partnership with a local company  china  taiwan  and the united kingdom  to take advantage of the high quality  low cost software development resources found in those countries 
additionally  we have plans to further increase development activity in our taiwan and china operations 
to date  we have limited experience in managing large scale software development outside the united states 
expanding our international software development inherently increases the complexity of managing these programs and may result in delays in introducing new products to market  or delays in completing service projects for our customers  which in turn may adversely impact the 
table of contents revenue we recognize from related software products and services and could also adversely impact the profitability of service engagements employing offshore resources  thereby negatively affecting our operating results 
as our customers seek more cost effective locations to develop and manufacture their smart devices  particularly overseas locations  our ability to continue to sell these customers our software products and services could be limited  which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results 
due to competitive and other pressures  some of our customers have moved  and others may seek to move  the development and manufacturing of their smart devices to overseas locations  which may limit our ability to sell these customers our software and services 
as an example  under our oda with microsoft  we are currently only able to sell microsoft windows embedded operating systems primarily in north america  the united kingdom and germany 
if our customers  or potential customers  move their manufacturing overseas we may be restricted from reselling these customers microsoft windows embedded operating systems  or our other products and services  which could negatively impact our revenue and operating results

overview we provide software solutions and related engineering services to companies that develop smart  connected devices 
a smart  connected device is a dedicated purpose computing device that typically has a display  runs an operating system eg  microsoft windows embedded compact and may be connected to a network via a wired or wireless connection 
examples of smart devices include set top boxes  home gateways  point of sale terminals  kiosks  voting machines  gaming platforms  tablets  handheld data collection devices  personal media players  smart phones and devices targeted at automotive applications 
we focus on smart devices that utilize embedded versions of the microsoft windows family of operating systems  specifically windows embedded compact  windows embedded standard and windows mobile as well as devices running other popular operating systems such as android  linux  and qnx 
we have been providing software solutions to the smart device marketplace since our inception 
our customers include world class original equipment manufacturers oems  original design manufacturers odms and enterprises  as well as silicon vendors svs and peripheral vendors which purchase our software solutions for purposes of facilitating processor and peripheral sales to the aforementioned customer categories 
in the case of enterprises  our customers include those which develop  market and distribute smart devices on their own behalf as well as those that purchase devices from oems or odms and require additional device software or testing 
the software solutions we provide are utilized and deployed throughout various phases of our customers device life cycle  including design  development  customization  quality assurance and deployment 
critical accounting judgments use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  percentage of completion on fixed price service contracts  fair values of financial instruments  deferred tax asset allowances  useful lives and fair value of intangible assets and property and equipment  fair values of stock based awards  income tax accruals  fair values of acquired assets and liabilities and the fair value of contingent purchase consideration  among other estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from software and engineering service sales when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents 
table of contents and time records are generally used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the selling price is fixed or determinable based on the contract and or customer purchase order and payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
periodically  we will begin work on engineering service engagements prior to having a signed contract and  in some cases  the contract is signed in a quarter after which service delivery costs are incurred 
we do not defer costs associated with such engagements before we have received a signed contract 
we recognize software revenue upon shipment provided that no significant obligations remain on our part  substantive acceptance conditions  if any  have been met and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenue from time and materials contracts  and training service agreements  is recognized as services are performed 
fixed price service agreements  and certain time and materials service agreements with capped fee structures  are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting because we believe it is the most accurate method to recognize revenue based on the nature and scope of these engineering service contracts  we believe it is a better measure of periodic income results than other methods and better matches revenue recognized with the costs incurred 
percentage of completion is measured based primarily on input measures such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
significant judgment is required when estimating total hours and progress to completion on these arrangements which determines the amount of revenue we recognize as well as whether a loss is recognized if one is expected to be incurred for the remainder of the project 
revisions to hour and cost estimates are incorporated in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we also enter into arrangements in which a customer purchases a combination of software licenses  engineering services and post contract customer support and or maintenance pcs 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements if there are multiple elements 
pcs may include rights to upgrades  when and if available  telephone support  updates and enhancements 
when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all elements in a multiple element arrangement  revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
vsoe of fair value is established by the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
accordingly  the judgments involved in assessing the fair values of various elements of an agreement can impact the recognition of revenue in each period 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between deliverables might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
when elements such as software and engineering services are contained in a single arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we allocate revenue to each element based on its relative fair value  provided that such element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  revenue is first allocated to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocated to the residual delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a delay of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
when engineering services and royalties are contained in a single arrangement  we recognize revenue from engineering services as earned in accordance with the criteria above even though the effective rate per hour may be lower than typical because the customer is contractually obligated to pay royalties on their device shipments 
we recognize royalty revenue  classified as software revenue  when the royalty report from the customer is received or when such royalties are contractually guaranteed and the revenue recognition criteria are met  particularly that collectability is reasonably assured 
there are two items involving revenue recognition that require us to make more difficult and subjective judgments the determination of vsoe of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimation of percentage of completion on fixed price service contracts 
historically  we have entered into very few multiple element arrangements other than those involving the sale of pcs related to the sale of our testquest automated 
table of contents testing tools 
we establish vsoe of fair value for testquest pcs based on the price when pcs is sold separately 
vsoe of testquest pcs has been well established in the past as these products have been sold on a stand alone basis for a number of years even prior to our acquisition of testquest assets in november we measure our estimate of completion on fixed price contracts  which in turn determines the amount of revenue we recognize  based primarily on actual hours incurred to date and our estimate of remaining hours necessary to complete the contract 
the process of estimating the remaining hours on a contract involves detailed estimates of remaining hours by the engineers and project managers involved with the project  factoring in such variables as the remaining tasks  the complexity of the tasks  the contracted quality of the software to be provided  the customer s estimated delivery date  integration of third party software and quality thereof and other factors 
every fixed price contract requires various approvals within our company  including our chief executive officer if significant 
this approval process takes into consideration a number of factors including the complexity of engineering 
historically  our estimation processes related to fixed price contracts have been accurate based on the information known at the time of the reporting of our results 
however  percentage of completion estimates require significant judgment 
as of december   we were delivering engineering services under fixed price service contracts 
the percentage of completion calculations on these contracts represents management s best estimates based on the facts and circumstances as of the filing of this report 
if there are changes to the underlying facts and circumstances  revisions to the percentage of completion calculations will be recorded in the period the changes are noted 
if we were under in our estimates of completion on every fixed bid contract active on december   our revenue would be over stated by  for allowance for doubtful accounts we review our accounts receivable regularly for collectability concerns 
in determining the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our intangible assets were generated through our past acquisitions of businesses and particular assets from businesses 
our intangible assets have consisted of acquired technology  customer relationships  trade names and trademarks  and non compete agreements 
factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge of  related to technology acquired from testquest in we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our annual testing date is december we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flow are based on our best 
table of contents estimate of future net sales  gross margins  and operating expenses 
certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the stock award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
restricted stock units rsus and restricted stock awards rsas are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant as determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimates  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
incentive compensation we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of attainment  and the level thereof  of bonuses payable under our annual incentive compensation programs 
we accrue bonuses and recognize the resulting expense when the bonus is judged to be reasonably likely to be earned as of year end and is estimable 
the amount accrued  and expense recognized  is the estimated portion of the bonus earned on a year to date basis less any amounts previously accrued 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration our year to date actual results and expected results for the remainder of the year 
because we consider estimated future results in assessing the likelihood of attainment  significant judgment is required 
if actual results differ materially from our estimates  the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated 
taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the countries and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
net operating losses and tax credits  to the extent not already utilized to offset taxable income or income taxes  also give rise to deferred tax assets 
we must then assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
beginning in and through the third quarter of  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards  and recorded a portion of our deferred tax assets related to such estimated future taxable income 
we estimate the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
our sales may be subject to other taxes  particularly withholding taxes  due to our sales to customers in countries other than the united states 
the tax regulations governing withholding taxes are complex  causing us to have to make assumptions about the appropriate tax treatment 
further  we make sales in many jurisdictions across the united states  where tax regulations are increasingly becoming more aggressive and complex 
we must therefore continue to analyze our state tax exposure and determine what the appropriate tax treatments are  and make estimates for sales  franchise  income and other state taxes 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated

the acquisition is part of our overall growth strategy and is designed to capitalize on the growing market for smart  connected devices by expanding both the breadth of services offered and the geographies that we serve 
as the acquisition took place late in the third quarter of  the impact on our results of operations was relatively insignificant for the year in total 
where applicable  the mpc related impacts have been noted in the following commentary 
revenue our revenue is generated from the sale of software  both our own proprietary software and third party software that we resell  and the sale of engineering services 
total revenue was million in both and a million decline in sales of microsoft operating systems in was offset by increases in our sale of adobe flash products  engineering services revenue  and proprietary software revenue 
our revenue mix has been shifting to customers located outside of north america as we have expanded our sales and development presence in locales outside north america 
before  our operations outside of north america consisted principally of operations in taiwan  as well as relatively minor sales and or support presences in china  india  japan  korea  and the united kingdom

third party software sales decreased million  or  in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decline in sales of windows embedded operating systems  the result of losing one major customer and lower purchasing volumes from several other large customers who worked through excess inventory levels during these declines were offset in part by a million increase in sales of windows mobile operating systems  with much of this increase related to higher purchasing volumes from two major device manufacturers in korea 
proprietary software revenue increased  or  in compared to due primarily to higher sales of qualcomm mobile development kits and increased revenue from our texas instruments omap software products

the myford touch infotainment system is an in car communications and entertainment system which enables drivers of ford s car offerings to access a wide range of connected information and entertainment experiences including music and multi media services  hands free telephony  internet enabled applications  language services  news and navigation 
our initial project with ford was completed in the third quarter of where we provided them hardware design and implementation  platform level software development  application level software development  quality assurance services and systems integration services for the myford touch 
since we completed the initial project  we are now primarily focused on developing and integrating new user applications for the myford touch  enhancing existing applications and customizing the myford touch platform for additional vehicle models 
in  we will continue to work on the myford touch project  however  rather than work directly for ford  we have been engaged by microsoft who is the primary provider of services for the myford touch programs 
ford contributed million in service revenue in  a decline of million from the number of engineers working on the myford touch declined since initial project completion in the third quarter of as we are no longer in the development stage of the myford touch platform 
total service revenue increased  or  in compared to due to growth inside and outside of north america from non ford customers 
north american service revenue declined million  or  to million in  primarily due to the million decline related to ford offset in part by revenue increases related to other customers 
service revenue in europe  the middle east  and africa the emea region increased by million  to million in  primarily driven by mpc which contributed million to emea revenue in since its acquisition in september service revenue from the apac region increased  or  to million in from million in  primarily related to a new customer in japan as well as contributions from china and korea resulting from our sales expansion in those areas 
gross profit and gross margin cost of revenue related to software revenue consists primarily of the cost of third party software products payable to third party vendors 
cost of revenue related to service revenue consists primarily of salaries and benefits  contractor costs and re billable expenses  related facilities and depreciation costs  and amortization of certain intangible assets related to acquisitions 
gross profit on the sale of third party software products was also positively affected by rebate credits of  in and  in from microsoft which we earned through the achievement of defined objectives 
the following table outlines software  services and total gross profit dollars in thousands year ended december  software gross profit software gross margin service gross profit service gross margin total gross profit total gross margin 
table of contents software gross profit and gross margin software gross profit decreased by  or  in  compared to  while software gross margin decreased by one percentage point to 
this decline was primarily due to a  impairment charge related to the acquired technology from testquest in which we recognized in the fourth quarter of as software cost of revenue 
the intangible assets associated with the acquired technology were deemed to be impaired as this technology is no longer used in any of our product offerings 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed development of tq  the next generation of our automated testing software 
tq replaces both of our legacy testquest products  countdown and tq pro  in what we will offer to our customers and provide technical support for in the future 
although tq is similar in concept to countdown and tq pro  tq was developed on a new code base and architecture 
as no significant future cash flows are expected to be generated from these legacy technologies  we deemed the intangible assets associated with them to be impaired 
without the impairment charge  software gross margin would have been consistent with the gross margin in the prior year 
service gross profit and gross margin service gross profit decreased by  or  in as compared to  while service gross margin decreased by two percentage points to in  from in the decline in service gross margin was primarily the result of higher engineering headcount in the current year largely resulting from our international expansion which resulted in a increase in available hours and increased our cost of sales by million compared to however  our actual billable hours only increased year over year as our utilization fell by eight percentage points in compared to  most of which resulted from start up time associated with new personnel and new development centers 
this decline in service margin was partially offset by a increase in our realized rate per hour in compared to operating expenses selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  commissions and bonuses for our sales  marketing and administrative personnel and related facilities and depreciation costs  as well as professional services fees eg  consulting  legal and audit 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in selling  general and administrative expenses represented of our total revenue in compared to of revenue in the increase was due in part to  higher stock compensation expense in the current year  as well as a million increase in sales and marketing expenses  which was driven by growth in our sales capacity in asia and europe  as well as our corporate rebranding in the current year 
general and administrative expenses were also higher in the current year as we added headcount to support our international growth 
the current period was also negatively affected by higher employee fringe rates as health insurance premiums increased during the year  and  in transaction related expenses associated with the mpc acquisition 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software development and quality assurance personnel  contractor and consultant costs and related facilities and depreciation costs
