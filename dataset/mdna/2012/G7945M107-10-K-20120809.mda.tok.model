critical accounting estimates 
accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
our company we are a leading provider of electronic data storage products 
our principal products are hard disk drives  commonly referred to as disk drives  hard drives or hdds 
hard disk drives are devices that store digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating disks with magnetic surfaces 
disk drives continue to be the primary medium of mass data storage due to their performance attributes  high quality  cost effectiveness and energy efficiencies 
we produce a broad range of electronic data storage products addressing enterprise applications  where our products are designed for enterprise servers  mainframes and workstations  client compute applications  where our products are designed for desktop and notebook computers  and client non compute applications  where our products are designed for a wide variety of end user devices such as digital video recorders dvrs  gaming consoles  personal data backup systems  portable external storage systems and digital media systems 
in addition to manufacturing and selling disk drives  we provide data storage services for small to medium sized businesses  including online backup  data protection and recovery solutions 
business overview our industry is characterized by several trends and factors that have a material impact on our strategic planning  financial condition and results of operations 
industry supply balance from time to time the industry has experienced periods of imbalance between supply and demand 
to the extent that the disk drive industry builds capacity based on expectations of demand that do not materialize  price erosion may become more pronounced 
conversely  during periods where demand exceeds supply  price erosion is generally muted 
in early october  floodwaters north of bangkok  thailand inundated many manufacturing industrial parks that contained a number of the factories supporting the hdd industry s supply chain 
the hdd industry had concentrated a large portion of its supply chain participants within these industrial parks in an effort to reduce cost and improve logistics 
as a result  the inundation of floodwaters into these industrial parks had caused the closure or suspension of production by a number of participants within the hdd supply chain 
during the supply chain disruption in fiscal year  we believe demand exceeded supply due to the impact from the flooding in thailand  resulting in an increase in the average selling price asp 
the industry s ability to manufacture and ship drives has continued to recover through the end of the fiscal year and we believe total shipments in the industry were approximately million units  compared to 
table of contents million units during fiscal year as of june   we believe that the hdd industry s component supply chain has substantially recovered 
demand trends for disk drives 
we believe that continued growth in digital content requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage  backup and use such content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drive products 
in addition  we believe the continued increased demand for electronic data storage  in developed countries as well as in emerging economies  reflects the demand for real time access to rich data and content driven by the impact of a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base 
we believe these trends will continue as computing architectures evolve to serve the growing commercial and consumer user base throughout the world 
we believe that in the foreseeable future the traditional enterprise and client compute markets that require high capacity storage solutions  as well as the data intensive client non compute markets  will continue to be best served by hard disk drives based on the industry s ability to deliver cost effective  reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices 
furthermore  the increased use of client non compute devices that consume media rich content streamed from the cloud increases the demand for high capacity disk drives in nearline applications 
price erosion 
our industry has been characterized by price declines for disk drive products with comparable capacity  performance and feature sets like for like products 
price declines for like for like products price erosion are more pronounced during periods of economic contraction or industry consolidation in which competitors may use discounted pricing to attempt to maintain or gain market share  few new product introductions when competitors have comparable or alternative product offerings  and industry supply exceeding demand 
disk drive manufacturers typically attempt to offset price erosion with an improved mix of disk drive products characterized by higher capacity  better performance and additional feature sets and or product cost reductions 
seasonality the disk drive industry traditionally experiences seasonal variability in demand with higher levels of demand in the second half of the calendar year 
this seasonality is driven by consumer spending in the back to school season from late summer to fall and the traditional holiday shopping season from fall to winter 
in addition  corporate demand is typically higher during the second half of the calendar year 
fiscal year summary revenues for fiscal year were billion which represented a increase in revenues from billion in the prior fiscal year 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
transaction with samsung on december   we completed the acquisition of samsung s hdd business pursuant to an asset purchase agreement apa entered into on april   by which the company acquired certain assets and liabilities of samsung relating to the research and development  manufacture and sale of hdds 
the transaction and related agreements are expected to improve our position as a supplier of inch products  position us to better address rapidly evolving opportunities in markets including  but not limited 
table of contents to  mobile computing  cloud computing and solid state storage  expand our customer access in china and southeast asia  and accelerate time to market for new products 
the december  acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred to samsung totaled billion  which consisted of million of our ordinary shares and million in cash 
the operations of samsung s hdd business are included in our results from the date of acquisition

units shipped in fiscal year increased  or million units  from fiscal year the increase in the average selling price to per unit during fiscal year  as compared to per unit in the prior year  was primarily due to the limited industry supply of hard drives resulting from the severe flooding in thailand

table of contents operating expenses fiscal years ended dollars in millions june  july  change change product development marketing and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other  net operating expenses product development expense 
product development expenses for fiscal year increased from fiscal year  primarily reflecting an increase in variable performance based compensation and the integration of the hdd business acquired from samsung 
marketing and administrative expense 
the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in variable performance based compensation and integration of the hdd business acquired from samsung 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal year increased as a result of the acquisition of certain intangible assets from samsung s hdd business 
restructuring and other  net 
restructuring and other  net for fiscal years and  were not material and primarily related to previously announced restructuring plans 
other income expense  net fiscal years ended dollars in millions june  july  change change other expense  net other expense  net for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was relatively flat  and included an increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances  substantially offset by gains on foreign currency remeasurement 
income taxes fiscal years ended dollars in millions june  july  change change provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal year compared to an income tax provision of million for fiscal year our fiscal year provision for income taxes included million of income tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in prior periods 
our fiscal year provision for income taxes included non us income taxes recorded for increases in income tax reserves for non us income tax positions taken in prior fiscal years  partially offset by tax benefits recorded for the release of income tax reserves associated with settlements of income tax audits and the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 
our irish tax resident parent holding company owns various us and non us subsidiaries that operate in multiple non irish tax jurisdictions 
our worldwide operating income is either subject to varying 
table of contents rates of tax or is exempt from tax due to tax holidays or tax incentive programs we operate under in malaysia  singapore and thailand 
these tax holidays or incentives are scheduled to expire in whole or in part at various dates through our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes  primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  and ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain us deferred tax assets 
the acquisition of samsung s hdd business did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal year our income taxes provision recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july  differed the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions  iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  and iv non us losses with no tax benefit 
based on our non us ownership structure and subject to i potential future increases in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  and ii a future change in our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings from our subsidiaries outside of ireland  we anticipate that our effective tax rate in future periods will generally be less than the irish statutory rate 
at june   our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was approximately billion 
at june   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
the realization of these deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on our ability to generate sufficient us and certain non us taxable income in future periods 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  may increase or decrease in subsequent periods when we re evaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future us and certain us taxable income 
at june   the use of approximately million and million of our us net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  respectively  is subject to an aggregate annual limitation of million pursuant to us tax law 
if certain ownership changes occur in the foreseeable future  there may be an additional annual limitation on our ability to use our total us federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of billion  billion  and million  respectively 
it is reasonably possible that such a change could occur 
if these ownership changes were to occur  we estimate a one time charge for additional us income tax expense of approximately to million may be recorded in the period such change occurs 
this additional income tax expense results from a decrease in our net us deferred tax assets recorded through a combination of the write off of deferred tax assets and associated changes to our valuation allowance 
we also estimate that the ensuing additional annual limitation on our ability to use tax attribute carryovers may result in increased us income tax expense associated with such change of approximately to million each year 
as of june  and july   we had approximately million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties 
the unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate is million and million as of june  and july   respectively  subject to certain future valuation allowance reversals 
it is our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of operations 
during fiscal year  we recognized a net tax expense for interest and penalties of million as compared to a net tax expense for interest and penalties of less than million and a net tax benefit of million during fiscal year and fiscal year  
table of contents respectively 
as of june   we had million of accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits compared to million in fiscal year during the fiscal year ended june   our unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties increased by approximately million primarily due to i increases in current year unrecognized tax benefits of million  ii net reductions in prior year unrecognized tax benefits of million  iii reductions associated with the expiration of certain statutes of limitation of million  iv reductions from other activity  including non us exchange gains  of million 
during the months beginning june   we expect to reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitation 
we do not believe it is reasonably possible that other unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next months 
we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions globally and are required to file us federal  us state  and non u 
s income tax returns 
in may  the us internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years ending in through the irs issued a revenue agent s report and proposed certain adjustments 
we are currently contesting one of these proposed adjustments through the irs appeals office 
we believe that the resolution of this disputed issue will have no material impact on our financial statements 
with respect to us state and us income tax returns  we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to fiscal year we are also no longer subject to tax examination of us federal income tax returns for years prior to fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change revenue revenue in fiscal year decreased approximately  or million  from fiscal year units shipped increased or million units from fiscal year this decrease in revenue was due to the cumulative effect of the competitive pricing environment the industry experienced  partially offset by industry wide supply constraints 
sales programs recorded as contra revenue were approximately and of our gross revenue for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change cost of revenue gross margin gross margin percentage for fiscal year  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to price erosion 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted by delays in ramping to maturity for new products  which unfavorably affected our manufacturing yields 

table of contents operating expenses fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change product development marketing and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring and other  net impairment of other long lived assets  net of recoveries operating expenses product development expense 
product development expenses for fiscal year were relatively flat from fiscal year  reflecting a decrease in variable performance based compensation  offset by an increase in spending for new programs and a decrease in research grants 
marketing and administrative expense 
the increase in marketing and administrative expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due primarily to an increase related to samsung acquisition expenses and litigation related expenses 
this was offset by a reduction in total compensation expenses  primarily variable performance based compensation 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal year decreased from fiscal year as certain intangibles relating to the metalincs  inc were fully amortized during restructuring and other  net 
during fiscal year  the recorded restructuring and other charges were primarily associated with previously announced restructuring activities 
restructuring and other  net during included a charge for our amk restructuring plan announced in august and a charge related to our pittsburgh  pennsylvania facility 
impairment of other long lived assets  net of recoveries 
during fiscal year  we did not record any impairment charge related to our long lived assets  and in we recorded an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of certain assets held for sale to their estimated fair value  less cost to sell 
other income expense  net fiscal years ended dollars in millions july  july  change change other income expense  net the change in other expense  net for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from higher average debt balances and million in losses related to the redemption of debt

our fiscal year income tax benefit included million of deferred tax benefit from the reversal of a portion of the us valuation allowance recorded in earlier years 
our income tax provision recorded for fiscal year differed from the provision for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii income tax expense related to intercompany transactions  iii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  and iv non us losses with no tax benefit 
our benefit for income taxes recorded for the comparative fiscal year ended july  differed from the provision benefit for income taxes that would be derived by applying the irish statutory rate of to income before income taxes primarily due to the net effect of i tax benefits related to non us earnings generated in jurisdictions that are subject to tax holidays or tax incentive programs and are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of ireland  ii a decrease in valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets  iii non us losses with no tax benefit  and iv tax expense related to intercompany transactions 
liquidity and capital resources the following sections discuss our principal liquidity requirements  as well as our sources and uses of cash and our liquidity and capital resources 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
our short term investments consist primarily of readily marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than days at the time of purchase 
the principal objectives of our investment policy are the preservation of principal and maintenance of liquidity 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality investment grade securities  limiting the time to maturity and by monitoring the counter parties and underlying obligors closely 
we monitor our investment portfolio and position our portfolio to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
we intend to maintain a highly liquid portfolio by investing only in those marketable securities that we believe have active secondary or resale markets 
we believe our cash equivalents and short term investments are liquid and accessible 
we operate in some countries that may have restrictive regulations over the movement of cash and or foreign exchange across their borders 
these restrictions have not impeded our ability to conduct business in those countries  nor do we expect them to in the next months 
we are not aware of any downgrades  losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or short term investments and accordingly  we do not believe the fair value of our short term investments has significantly changed from the values reported as of june  cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash and investments as of dollars in millions june  july  change cash and cash equivalents short term investments restricted cash and investments total 
table of contents our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash and investments decreased from july   primarily as a result of the repurchase of our ordinary shares  repayments of long term debt  payments made to acquire the samsung hdd business  capital expenditures and dividends paid to our shareholders  which were offset by cash provided by operating activities and cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares under employee stock plans

cash used in investing activities in fiscal year  we used billion for net cash investing activities  which was due primarily to payments for property  equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million and net payments for the acquisition of samsung s hdd business of million 

table of contents in fiscal year  we used million for net cash investing activities  which was primarily attributable to payments for property  equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million 
in fiscal year  we used million for net cash investing activities  which was primarily attributable to payments for property  equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million 
cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities of billion for fiscal year was attributable to billion paid to repurchase million of our ordinary shares  million in long term debt repayments and million in dividends paid to our shareholders 
this was partially offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal year was attributable to billion in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt partially offset by million to repurchase million of our ordinary shares and million for the repayment of our long term debt 
net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal year was primarily attributable to the repayment of million of our amended credit facility and the repayment and repurchases of million of our long term debt 
the repayment and repurchases were paid primarily with million of restricted cash  previously held in escrow 
we also paid approximately million to repurchase million of our ordinary shares  which was partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases 
liquidity sources our primary sources of liquidity as of june   consisted of approximately billion in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments  cash we expect to generate from operations and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
we also had million in restricted cash and investments  of which million was related to our employee deferred compensation liabilities under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
on january   seagate technology plc  and its subsidiary seagate hdd entered into a credit agreement which provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
seagate technology plc and certain of its material subsidiaries fully and unconditionally guarantee  on a senior secured basis  the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures in january the revolving credit facility is available for cash borrowings and for the issuance of letters of credit up to a sub limit of million 
as of june   no borrowings have been drawn under the revolving credit facility  and million had been utilized for letters of credit 
the line of credit is available for borrowings  subject to compliance with financial covenants and other customary conditions to borrowing 
the credit agreement that governs our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that we must satisfy in order to remain in compliance with the credit agreement  including three financial covenants minimum amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a net leverage ratio 
as of june   we are in compliance with all covenants  including the financial ratios that we are required to maintain 
we believe that our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents cash requirements and commitments our liquidity requirements are primarily to meet our working capital  research and development and capital expenditure needs  to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  and to fund our dividend 
our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows  which are determined by future operating performance  and therefore  subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
on july   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share  which will be payable on august  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august  as of june   we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements 
based on our current outlook  we expect to be in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements over the next months 
the carrying value of our long term debt as of june  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
the table below presents the principal amounts of our outstanding long term debt in order of maturity as of dollars in millions june  july  change senior notes due october senior secured second priority notes due may senior notes due october senior notes due december senior notes due may senior notes due november total during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million of our ordinary shares 
see item market for registrant s shares  related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities repurchases of our equity securities 
for fiscal year  we expect capital investment to be below the historical targeted range of of revenue 
we require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
we will continue to evaluate and manage the retirement and replacement of existing debt and associated obligations  including the issuance of new debt securities  exchanging existing debt securities for other debt securities and retiring debt pursuant to privately negotiated transactions  open market purchases or otherwise 
in addition  we may selectively pursue strategic alliances  acquisitions and investments  which may require additional capital 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our contractual cash obligations and commitments as of june   have been summarized in the table below fiscal year s dollars in millions total thereafter contractual cash obligations long term debt interest payments on debt capital expenditures operating leases purchase obligations subtotal commitments letters of credit or bank guarantees total includes total future minimum rent expense under non cancelable leases for both occupied and vacated facilities rent expense is shown net of sublease income 
purchase obligations are defined as contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services  which are enforceable and legally binding on us  and that specify all significant terms 
as of june   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million  none of which is expected to be settled within one year 
outside of one year  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include establishment of sales program accruals  establishment of warranty accruals  accounting for income taxes  and the accounting for goodwill and other long lived assets 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other accounting policies and accounting estimates relating to uncollectible customer accounts  valuation of inventory  valuation of share based payments and restructuring 
we believe that these other accounting policies and accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
establishment of sales program accruals 
we establish certain distributor and oem sales programs aimed at increasing customer demand 
for the distribution channel  these programs typically involve 
table of contents rebates related to a distributor s level of sales  order size  advertising or point of sale activity and price protection adjustments 
for oem sales  rebates are typically based on an oem customer s volume of purchases or other agreed upon rebate programs 
we provide for these obligations at the time that revenue is recorded based on estimated requirements 
we estimate these contra revenue rebates and adjustments based on various factors  including price reductions during the period reported  estimated future price erosion  customer orders  distributor sell through and inventory levels  program participation  customer claim submittals and sales returns 
our estimates reflect contractual arrangements but also our judgment relating to variables such as customer claim rates and attainment of program goals  and inventory and sell through levels reported by our distribution customers 
currently  our distributors inventories are at the low end of the historical range 
while we believe we have sufficient experience and knowledge of the market and customer buying patterns to reasonably estimate such rebates and adjustments  actual market conditions or customer behavior could differ from our expectations 
as a result  actual payments under these programs  which may spread over several months after the related sale  may vary from the amount accrued 
accordingly  revenues and margins in the period in which the adjustment occurs may be affected 
significant actual variations in any of the factors upon which we base our contra revenue estimates could have a material effect on our operating results 
in fiscal year  sales programs were approximately of gross revenue  reflecting the cumulative effect of the advantageous pricing environment during the second half of fiscal year for fiscal years and  total sales programs ranged from to of gross revenues 
adjustments to revenues due to under or over accruals for sales programs related to revenues reported in prior quarterly periods averaged of quarterly gross revenue for fiscal years through  and were approximately of gross revenue in fiscal year any future shifts in the industry supply demand balance as well as other factors may result in a more competitive pricing environment and may cause sales programs as a percentage of gross revenue to increase from the current or historical levels 
if such rebates and incentives trend upwards  revenues and margins will be reduced 
establishment of warranty accruals 
we estimate probable product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
we generally warrant our products for a period of to years 
our warranty provision considers estimated product failure rates and trends including the timing of product returns during the warranty periods  and estimated repair or replacement costs related to product quality issues  if any 
we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives 
should actual experience in any future period differ significantly from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
our judgment is subject to a greater degree of subjectivity with respect to newly introduced products because of limited experience with those products upon which to base our warranty estimates 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have an adverse or favorable effect on our results of operations if the actual rate of unit failure  the cost to repair a unit  or the actual cost required to satisfy customer claims differs from those estimates we used in determining the warranty accrual 
since we typically outsource our warranty repairs  our repair cost is subject to periodic negotiations with vendors and may vary from our estimates 
we also exercise judgment in estimating our ability to sell certain repaired disk drives 
to the extent such sales fall below our forecast  warranty cost will be adversely impacted 
we review our warranty accrual quarterly for products shipped in prior periods and which are still under warranty 
any changes in the estimates underlying the accrual may result in adjustments that impact the current period gross margins and income 
in fiscal year  net favorable changes in estimates of prior warranty accruals as a percentage of revenue were immaterial 
our total warranty cost was  and of revenue during fiscal years  and  respectively  while warranty cost related to new shipments exclusive of the impact of re estimates of pre existing liabilities were  and 
table of contents respectively  for the same periods 
changes in anticipated failure rates of specific products and significant changes in repair or replacement costs have historically been the major reasons for significant changes in prior estimates 
any future changes in failure rates of certain products  as well as changes in repair costs or the cost of replacement parts  may result in increased or decreased warranty accruals 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to accounting standards codification asc topic asc  income taxes 
in applying asc  we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  recognition of income and deductions and calculation of specific tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other tax jurisdictions 
if estimates of these tax liabilities are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or provision will result 
the deferred tax assets we record each period depend primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income in the united states and certain non us jurisdictions 
each period  we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and  if necessary  we adjust the valuation allowance so that net deferred tax assets are recorded only to the extent we conclude it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
if our outlook for future taxable income changes significantly  our assessment of the need for a valuation allowance may also change 
assessing goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment 
we account for goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
as required by asc  we perform a qualitative assessment in determining whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
based on the qualitative assessment  if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the company is not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test other long lived assets  including property  equipment and leasehold improvements and other intangible assets subject to amortization  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of those assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using the same approaches indicated above for asc step two and compare it to its carrying value 
the excess of the carrying value over the fair value is allocated pro rata to derive the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group 
the adjusted carrying value of each asset in the asset group is not reduced below its fair value

table of contents interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
at june   with the exception of our auction rate securities  we had no marketable securities that had been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than months and determined that no investments were other than temporarily impaired 
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have fixed rate debt obligations 
we enter into debt obligations for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we currently do not use interest rate derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt

we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures 
our policy prohibits us from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during fiscal years and  we did not enter into any hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
we also hedge a portion of our foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions with foreign currency forward exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
the changes in fair value of these hedges are recognized in earnings in the same period as the gains and losses from the remeasurement of the assets and liabilities 
these foreign currency forward exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under asc  derivatives and hedging 
all these forward contracts mature within months 
we evaluate hedging effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively and record any ineffective portion of the hedging instruments in costs of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
we did not have any material net gains losses recognized in costs of revenue for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness or discontinued cash flow hedges during fiscal years and the table below provides information as of june  about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts

other market risks 
we have exposure to counterparty credit downgrades in the form of credit risk related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts and our fixed income portfolio 
we monitor and limit our credit exposure for our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by performing ongoing credit evaluations 
we also manage the notional amount of contracts entered into with any one counterparty  and we maintain limits on maximum tenor of contracts based on the credit rating of the financial institutions 
additionally  the investment portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
as of june   we had counterparty credit exposure of million comprised of the mark to market valuation related to our foreign currency forward exchange contracts in a gain position 
changes in our corporate issuer credit ratings have minimal impact on our financial results  but downgrades may negatively impact our future transaction costs and our ability to execute transactions with various counterparties 
we are subject to equity market risks due to changes in the fair value of the notional investments selected by our employees as part of our seagate deferred compensation plan the sdcp 
we currently manage our exposure to equity market risks associated with the sdcp liabilities by investing directly in mutual funds that mirror the employees investment options 
as of june  we continued to hold auction rate securities with a par value of approximately million  all of which are collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the federal family education loan program 
beginning in the march quarter  these securities have continuously failed to settle at auction 
as of june   the estimated fair value of these auction rate securities was million 
we believe that the impairments totaling million are temporary as we do not intend to sell these securities and have concluded it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis 
as such  the impairment was recorded in other comprehensive income loss and these securities were classified as long term investments
