item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part ii item of this report 
average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances 
forward looking statements the disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in part i captioned forward looking statements and item a captioned risk factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report 
executive summary we reported record annual earnings of million in  an increase of million  or from million a year ago 
earnings include the impact of the fdic assisted acquisition of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the former charter oak bank on february  partially offset by the thousand pre payment penalty on the early pay off of a million fixed rate fhlb advance 
diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  totaled  up from in the prior year 
the acquired operations of the former charter oak bank contributed approximately million to bancorp s pre tax income  including  among other things  million of accretion on purchased non credit impaired loans  million in loan loss provision  million of gains recognized in interest income on pay offs of purchased credit impaired loans pci loans  million in acquisition related third party costs  thousand impairment write off of the core deposit intangible asset and thousand in pre tax bargain purchase gain 
the income amounts discussed above exclude allocated overhead and allocated cost of funds 
the accretion on purchased non credit impaired loans is expected to decline significantly over the next year 
in addition to our entry into the napa market through the acquisition  in we have expanded our community banking footprint in sonoma county 
in october  the bank opened a branch in downtown sonoma and expanded our santa rosa loan production office into a full service branch 
we have experienced an increase in non interest expenses and may experience a short term lag in profitability associated with the new branch openings 
we expect that these strategic initiatives will contribute to our profitability in the long term 
page 
table of contents we are committed to building strong lending relationships in new and core markets 
total loans reached billion at december   representing an increase of million  or 
the increase reflects the loans in the napa market totaling million at december   primarily the remaining loans purchased in the acquisition as well as growth in the bank s commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and home equity portfolios  partially offset by a decreased emphasis on certain product lines  including construction and other residential lending 
non accrual loans totaled million  or of bancorp s loan portfolio at december   compared to million or a year ago 
the provision for loan losses totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily driven by million of loan loss provision related to the acquired loans  where credit quality has deteriorated since the acquisition 
the allowance for loan losses of million totaled of loans at december  compared to million or at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans reflects a higher level of impaired loans and the related specific reserves 
net charge offs in totaled million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in net loan charge offs primarily relates to million of charge offs related to the acquired loans 
our continued focus on responsible community banking fundamentals and our strong customer relationships has led to higher deposits  a core funding source for our loan portfolio 
total deposits grew million  or  from a year ago to billion at december  the higher level of deposits reflects growth in most categories  except cdars time deposits  which decreased million 
non interest bearing deposits grew million or to million and comprised of total deposits at december   compared to a year ago 
the increase in total deposits includes deposits in the napa market  primarily assumed in the acquisition  totaling million at december  the tax equivalent net interest margin was in compared to in tax equivalent net interest income for totaled million  representing an increase of million  or compared to the increase primarily reflects the acquisition of loans from the former charter oak bank and a reduction in the cost of deposits  partially offset by the thousand pre payment penalty on the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb advance in the third quarter of in the current environment of historically low interest rates  the largest factors likely to affect our net interest margin in will be our ability to reduce low yielding excess liquidity by generating profitable loans to creditworthy borrowers  as well as our responsiveness to competitive pricing on loans and deposits in our market 
the acquisition  especially the accretion on acquired non pci loans expected to decline significantly over the next year and gains on payoffs of pci loans  favorably impacted our net interest margin 
we will need to grow loans significantly to maintain the elevated level of net interest margin 
further  as fixed rate loans mature  we expect loan production to continue to be challenging due to the uncertain economic climate and the intensifying competition for creditworthy borrowers  both of which could lead to loan rate concession pressure and could impact our ability to generate profitable loans 
lastly  approximately of our loans are variable rate loans  whose repricing intervals lag between one to five years after their applicable rate indices change 
the downward repricing on these variable loans will put pressure on our net interest margin 
refer to table  loan portfolio maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity for further information 
it is imperative for us to manage customer and product profitability  especially when the interest rate environment remains stable 
if interest rates increase  we anticipate that net interest income will rise 
the increase in interest income from asset repricing may be partially offset by deposit rate sensitivity 
additionally  it may take several upward market rate movements for variable rate loans at floors to move above the floor rates

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has determined the following five accounting policies to be critical allowance for loan losses  acquired loans  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  accounting for income taxes and fair value measurements 
allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates of loan losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
in periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance  management considers our past loan loss experience by type of credit  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors 
we formally assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are reviewed as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower and or when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of default 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by outside consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by periodic examination by various bank regulatory agencies 
management monitors delinquent loans continuously and identifies problem loans to be evaluated individually for impairment testing 
for loans that are determined impaired  formal impairment measurement is performed at least quarterly on a loan by loan basis 
our method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors 
allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
loss estimation factors for loan categories are based on analysis of local economic factors applicable to each loan category  including consideration of our historical charge off history 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the loan portfolio as a whole 
for our methodology on estimating the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans  refer to the section acquired loans below 
acquired loans acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date in accordance with asc business combinations  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded for acquired loans as of the acquisition date 
the process of estimating fair values of the acquired loans  including the estimate of losses that are expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the loans at acquisition date and the ongoing updates to management s expectation of future cash flows  requires significant subjective judgments and assumptions  particularly considering the current economic environment 
the economic environment and the lack of market liquidity and transparency are factors that have influenced  and may continue to affect  these assumptions and estimates 
we estimated the fair value of acquired loans at the acquisition date based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considered factors including the type of loan and related collateral  risk classification  fixed or variable interest rate  term of loan and whether or not the loan was amortizing  and current discount rates 
loans were grouped together according to similar characteristics and were treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques 
the estimate of expected cash flows incorporates our best estimate of current key assumptions  such as property values  default rates  loss severity and prepayment speeds 
the discount rates used for loans were based on current market rates for new originations of comparable loans  where available  and include adjustments for liquidity concerns 
to the extent comparable market rates are not readily available  a discount rate was derived based on the assumptions of market participants cost of funds  servicing costs and return requirements for comparable risk assets 
in either case  the discount rate does not include a factor for credit losses  as that has been considered in estimating the cash flows 
the initial estimate of cash flows to be collected was derived from assumptions such as default rates  loss severities and prepayment speeds 
page 
table of contents in conjunction with the acquisition  we purchased certain loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration subsequent to their origination and for which it was probable  at acquisition  that we would be unable to collect all contractually required payments 
management has applied significant subjective judgment in determining which loans are pci loans 
evidence of credit quality deterioration as of the purchase date may include statistics such as past due and nonaccrual status  risk grades and recent loan to value percentages 
revolving credit agreements eg home equity lines of credit and revolving commercial loans  where the borrower had revolving privileges at acquisition date  are not considered pci loans because the timing and amount of cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
the accounting guidance for pci loans provides that the excess of the cash flows initially expected to be collected over the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date ie  the accretable yield should be accreted into interest income at a level rate of return over the remaining term of the loan  provided that the timing and amount of future cash flows is reasonably estimable 
the difference between the contractually required payments and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition  considering the impact of prepayments  is referred to as the nonaccretable difference and is not recorded 
the initial estimate of cash flows expected to be collected is updated each quarter and requires the continued usage of key assumptions and estimates similar to the initial estimate of fair value 
given the current economic environment  we must apply judgment to develop our estimate of cash flows for pci loans given the impact of real estate value changes  changing loss severities and prepayment speeds 
for purposes of accounting for the pci loans purchased in the acquisition  we elected not to apply the pooling method but to account for these loans individually 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans to third parties  receipt of payments in full by the borrower  foreclosure of the collateral or troubled debt restructurings  result in removal of the loan from the pci loan portfolio at its carrying amount 
if we have probable and significant increases in cash flows expected to be collected on pci loans  we first reverse any previously established allowance for loan loss and then increase interest income as a prospective yield adjustment over the remaining life of the loans 
the impact of changes in variable interest rates is recognized prospectively as adjustments to interest income 
all pci loans that were classified as nonperforming loans prior to acquisition were no longer classified as nonperforming because  at acquisition  we believed that we would fully collect the new carrying value of these loans 
subsequent to acquisition  specific allowances are allocated to pci loans that have experienced credit deterioration through an increase to the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of cash flows expected to be collected and  accordingly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are particularly sensitive to changes in loan credit quality 
when there is doubt as to the timing and amount of future cash flows to be collected  pci are classified as non accrual loans 
it is important to note that judgment is required to classify pci loans as performing or non accrual  and is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
for acquired loans not considered pci loans  we elect to recognize the entire fair value discount accretion based on the acquired loan s contractual cash flows using an effective interest rate method for term loans  and on a straight line basis to interest income for revolving lines  as the timing and amount of cash flows under revolving lines are not predictable 
subsequent to acquisition  if the probable and estimable losses for non pci loans exceed the amount of the remaining unaccreted discount  the excess is established as an allowance for loan losses 
for further information regarding our acquired loans  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
page 
table of contents other than temporary impairment of investment securities at each financial statement date  we assess whether declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their costs are deemed to be other than temporary 
we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  the remaining payment terms of the instrument and economic factors that are relevant to the collectability of the instrument  such as current prepayment speeds  the current financial condition of the issuer s  industry analyst reports  credit ratings  credit default rates  interest rate trends and the value of any underlying collateral 
credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to earnings and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
non credit related other than temporary impairment results in a charge to other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes  and the corresponding establishment of a new cost basis for the security 
the other than temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income for debt securities classified as held to maturity is accreted from other comprehensive income to the amortized cost of the debt security over the remaining life of the debt security in a prospective manner on the basis of the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows 
accounting for income taxes income taxes reported in the financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach 
we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business 
bancorp files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  we may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
management believes that all of our tax positions taken meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
to the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions  our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities 
fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures 
we base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
securities available for sale  derivatives  and loans held for sale  if any  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a non recurring basis  such as purchased loans recorded at acquisition date  certain impaired loans held for investment and securities held to maturity that are other than temporarily impaired 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically involve write downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting 
we have established and documented a process for determining fair value 
we maximize the use of observable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
whenever there is no readily available market data  management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements 
for detailed information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k

table of contents net interest income net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investments and other interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is impacted by changes in general market interest rates and by changes in the amounts and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk exposure with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on net interest margin 
net interest margin is expressed as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on total interest earning assets and the average rate incurred on total interest bearing liabilities 
both of these measures are reported on a taxable equivalent basis 
net interest margin is the higher of the two because it reflects interest income earned on assets funded with non interest bearing sources of funds  which include demand deposits and stockholders equity 
table  distribution of average statements of condition and analysis of net interest income  compares interest income and average interest earning assets with interest expense and average interest bearing liabilities for the three years ended december   and the table also indicates net interest income  net interest margin and net interest rate spread for each period presented

yields on available for sale securities are calculated based on amortized cost balances rather than fair value  as changes in fair value are reflected as a component of stockholders equity 
investment security interest is earned on day basis monthly 
yields and interest income on tax exempt securities and loans are presented on a taxable equivalent basis using the federal statutory rate of percent 
average balances on loans outstanding include non performing loans 
the amortized portion of net loan origination fees is included in interest income on loans  representing an adjustment to the yield 
page 
table of contents compared with tax equivalent net interest income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million or increase was due to an increase in volume of interest earning assets and the increase in loan yield  offset by the effect of lower yields on investment securities 
the tax equivalent net interest margin increased to in  up eighteen basis points from the increase in the tax equivalent net interest margin primarily reflects the acquisition of loans from the former charter oak bank and a reduction in the cost of deposits  partially offset by the thousand pre payment penalty on the fhlb advance in the third quarter of  as well as lower yields on investment securities and originated loans and a higher concentration of low yielding due from banks 
in  pci loans paid off early where the payoff amounts exceeded the recorded investment by million which favorably impacted our net interest margin by fifteen basis points 
accretion on the acquired non pci loans of million contributed twenty three basis points to the net interest margin 
the net interest spread increased twenty one basis points from the same period last year for the same reasons 
average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to this included increases in average interest earning due from banks of million  average investment securities of million and average loan growth of million mainly due to the acquisition on february  
market interest rates are in part based on the target federal funds interest rate the interest rate banks charge each other for short term borrowings implemented by the fomc 
in december of  the target interest rate was brought to a historic low with a range of to where it remains as of december  the yield on interest earning assets increased three basis points in compared to the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised and of average earning assets in and  respectively  increased forty basis points 
the accretion on the acquired non pci loans of million represents twenty nine basis points of the increase and the early payoff on pci loans where the payoff amounts exceeded the recorded investment by million represents nineteen basis points of the increase 
this increase is partially offset by the decrease in yields on investment securities due to lower yields on recently purchased securities in this low interest rate environment and a higher concentration of low yielding due from banks 
in addition  we have experienced downward repricing and rate concessions on the loan portfolio as well as the addition of new loans at lower current market rates 
the current level of accretion on non pci loans is expected to continue to decline 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to average deposits grew in most categories  except for cdars time deposits  which decreased million 
the increase in average deposits was offset by a decrease in average fhlb borrowings of million due to the early pay off of a million fhlb fixed rate advance at on september  the rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased eighteen basis points in compared to  primarily reflecting lower offering rates on money market accounts  as well as the downward re pricing of time deposits as they mature 
in  the rate on other time deposits  cdars  and money market accounts decreased thirty three basis points  fifty eight basis points  and thirty one basis points  respectively

average interest earning assets increased million  or  in compared to this included increases in average interest bearing due from banks of million  average investment securities of million and average loan growth of million 
in october  we opened our santa rosa loan production office  to position the bank for additional loan growth  particularly in commercial and industrial loans 
the tax equivalent net interest margin decreased to in  down twenty two basis points from the decrease in the tax equivalent net interest margin was primarily due to lower yields on investment securities as a result of increased prepayments and lower yields on recent additions and a shift in the relative composition of interest earning assets from higher yielding loans to lower yielding interest bearing due from banks 
the excess liquidity from deposit inflows has not yet been deployed into funding new loans  as the banking industry as a whole has been experiencing challenges with loan demand and the competition for qualified borrowers intensified 
the net interest spread decreased nineteen basis points from for the same reasons 
page 
table of contents the yield on the loan portfolio  which comprised and of average earning assets in and  respectively  increased three basis points in compared to this is mainly due to the shift in the mix of loans from construction and commercial loans to higher yielding commercial real estate loans 
interest foregone on non accrual loans represented a seven basis point reduction to the net interest margin in both and the lower yields on investment securities are a result of increased prepayments resulting in accelerated amortization of premiums  and lower yields on recently purchased securities 
the yield on private label cmos  agency securities and municipal bonds decreased basis points  basis points and ten basis points  respectively  in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  in compared to the increases are pervasive in all categories of deposit accounts except money market accounts  with the most significant increase in time deposits including cdars  which increased million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in overnight borrowings of million 
we have experienced a shift in the relative composition of interest bearing deposits in compared to as the proportion of higher costing time accounts has increased  while the proportion of money market deposit accounts has decreased 
the rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased fifteen basis points in compared to  primarily reflecting lower offering rates on money market accounts  as well as the downward re pricing of time deposits as they mature 
in  the rate on other time deposits  cdars  and money market accounts decreased thirty seven basis points  twenty three basis points  and twenty basis points  respectively 
the rate on the subordinated debenture dropped sixty one basis points due to a decline in the three month libor rate  to which the debenture rate is indexed

table of contents provision for loan losses management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis based on several factors including growth of the loan portfolio  analysis of probable losses in the portfolio  recent loss experience and the current economic climate 
actual losses on loans are charged against the allowance  and the allowance is increased through the provision for loan losses charged to expense 
for further discussion  see the section captioned critical accounting policies 
our provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in the increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily driven by million of loan loss provision related to the acquired loans in the later half of  where credit quality has deteriorated since the acquisition

this is partially offset by volatility in the equity and bond markets which impacts the market value of trust assets and the related investment fees 
as of december  and  assets under management totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in bank owned life insurance boli income in compared to is primarily due to additional income earned on million in new policies purchased in late march the decrease in customer banking fees and other charges is due to less atm surcharge and higher remote capture fee income waived  partially offset by higher credit card referral fees and check order income  relating to an increase in the number of customer accounts 
the increase in debit card interchange fees is primarily attributable to a steady increase in volume of debit card usage  as well as new accounts from the acquisition 
in june  the frb finalized a new regulation to restrict interchange fees charged for debit card transactions by banks with more than billion in assets 
although we are exempt under the new rule  market pricing of the interchange fees may drive these revenues down 
the effect on market pricing  if any  may take time to realize 
therefore  we cannot quantify the ultimate impact of this rule on such interchange fees

other income decreased due to lower merchant interchange income  partially offset by increases on the gain on disposal of repossessed assets  safe deposit box rental income and wire fee income

boli income remained relatively unchanged in compared to the increase in customer banking fees and other charges was due to higher credit card referral fees  miscellaneous card fees  atm surcharges and check order income  relating to an increase in the number of customer accounts  partially offset by higher remote capture fee income waived 
the increase in debit card interchange fees was primarily due to higher visa debit card fees  attributable to a higher volume of visa debit card usage  as well as a bank wide visa debit card promotion program 
the increase in other non interest income was mainly due to an increase in merchant interchange due to a higher transaction volume from our merchant customers as well as one time billing adjustments and an increase in the dividend received on fhlb stock  partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income

the number of average fte totaled and in and  respectively 
the increases in occupancy and equipment expense are mainly due to an increase in expenses related to branch expansion  including napa  sonoma and a full year of rent for our santa rosa branch  partially offset by a full year of cost savings from the relocation of our corte madera branch and leases re negotiated at lower rates 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased as reflected the accelerated amortization of leasehold improvements of our old corte madera branch when it relocated in july the decrease in fdic insurance expenses compared to reflects the revision to the fdic insurance assessment base 
as discussed in the section captioned fdic insurance assessments in item business above  in february  as required by the dodd frank act  the fdic approved a rule that changes the fdic insurance assessment base from adjusted domestic deposits to a bank s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  defined as tier capital 
while the new rule expanded the assessment base  it lowered assessment rate to between and basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category 
the change was effective for the second quarter of since we have a solid core deposit base and do not rely heavily on borrowings and brokered deposits  the benefits of the lower assessment rate significantly outweighed the effect of a wider assessment base 
the decrease in fdic insurance also reflects the expiration of the fdic transaction account guarantee program tagp on december   which provided unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts 
we paid a basis point surcharge per covered balances in excess of thousand from january to december the increase in data processing expense is due to thousand acquisition related expenses  an annual contractual rate increase  as well as additional ongoing fees relating to a higher number of accounts 
the increase in professional service expenses in when compared to primarily reflects expenses incurred related to the acquisition  including investment banking consultants  legal  accounting and valuation services 
additionally  we incurred more legal fees related to loan workouts in than in advertising expenses increased  primarily due to the additional expenses related to franchise expansion 
director fees increased slightly due to the director compensation rate increase 
we recorded a core deposit intangible asset of thousand at acquisition  of which thousand was written off in the fourth quarter of and thousand was amortized during the year 
the write off was primarily due to higher than anticipated runoff of the acquired deposits and a significant decline in alternative funding costs since the acquisition 
the increase in other non interest expense from was primarily due to higher costs associated with an increase in the volume of debit card usage  write offs of certain assets from the acquisition  the implementation of a bank wide customer service training program  higher travel expenses and higher telephone expenses

in addition  a rise in employee benefit rates contributed to the increase 
the increases in occupancy and equipment expense over were mainly due to an increase in rent for our greenbrae branch in its first full year of service in  and also the new santa rosa loan production office  partially offset by cost savings from the relocation of our corte madera branch 
the decrease in fdic insurance was due to the absence of a special assessment totaling thousand in the second quarter of  partially offset by a higher fdic assessment rate and higher deposits 
further  we elected to participate in the fdic transaction account guarantee program  which provided unlimited insurance coverage on non interest bearing transaction accounts defined by the fdic  on which we paid a basis point surcharge per covered balances in excess of thousand through the basis point surcharge on non interest bearing transaction accounts over thousand increased to basis points from january to december  at which time the program expired

the increase in professional service expenses in when compared to was mainly due to higher costs associated with strategic expansion initiatives and investment advisory fees 
advertising expenses decreased in  primarily due to a decrease in the usage of traditional print advertising channels as part of the marketing program 
director fees increased due to the director compensation rate increase  partially offset by fewer directors 
the increase in other non interest expense from was primarily due to a higher provision for losses on off balance sheet commitments due to a higher commitment amount  operational losses  higher printing and stationery costs  charitable contributions and staff relation costs 
provision for income taxes we reported a provision for income taxes of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the effective tax rates were   and for those same periods 
these provisions reflect accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and california franchise tax based upon reported pre tax income  and adjusted for the effects of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes such as earnings on qualified municipal securities  boli and certain tax exempt loans 
therefore  there are normal fluctuations in the effective rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax 
we have not been subject to an alternative minimum tax amt during these periods 
bancorp and the bank have entered into a tax allocation agreement which provides that income taxes shall be allocated between the parties on a separate entity basis 
the intent of this agreement is that each member of the consolidated group will incur no greater tax liability than it would have incurred on a stand alone basis

table of contents allowance for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are charged off against the allowance 
the balance of our allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of the remaining losses inherent in the portfolio 
the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the real estate market  changes in interest rates and economic and political environments 
based on the current conditions of the loan portfolio  management believes that the million allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio 
the components of the allowance for loan losses as stated previously in critical accounting policies  and note to the consolidated financial statements in this report  the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance for individually identified impaired loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits with similar characteristics and trends  and an allowance for changing economic factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors  etc the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified problem credits and the evaluation of sources of repayment including collateral  as applicable 
through management s ongoing loan grading process and credit monitoring process  individual loans are identified that have conditions that indicate the borrower may be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
these loans are evaluated individually for impairment by management and specific allowances for loan losses are established when the fair value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
for loans determined to be impaired  the extent of the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate at origination  based on the loan s observable market price  or based on the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
generally with problem credits that are collateral dependent  we obtain appraisals evaluations of the collateral at least annually 
impaired loan balances increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in impaired loans is primarily the result of newly identified tdr loans upon the adoption of accounting standards update no 
 as well as pci loans that have experienced credit deterioration post acquisition 
the specific allowance increased from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the specific allowance primarily relates to an increased number of impaired loans and deteriorating collateral values associated with those impaired loans 
we are proactive in charging off the uncollectible portion of impaired loans 
the increase in specific reserves is also a function of higher levels of commercial  residential real estate  home equity and construction loans awaiting resolution of pending events before a determination can be made as to whether or not the loan should be charged off 
the second component  the allowance factor  is an estimate of the probable inherent losses in each loan pool stratified by major segments or loans with similar characteristics in our loan portfolio 
this analysis encompasses our entire loan portfolio  but excludes any loans that were analyzed individually for specific allowances as discussed above and excludes acquired loans where the discount has not been fully accreted 
this analysis also includes loan types and economic and business conditions unique to each segment  including the bank s own loss history 
for loans graded substandard and not already evaluated for impairment in the first component analysis above  they are also assigned an allowance factor 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the number of loans makes it impractical to review every loan at every reporting date 
therefore  it is possible that in the future some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the total amount allocated for the second component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loan types 
at december  and  the allowance allocated by categories of credits totaled million and million  respectively 
as disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements in item below  loans graded substandard totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
during  management evaluated the allowance factors used based on historical loss experience during this economic cycle  as well as expected loan loss trends inherent in the portfolio 
the impact of this evaluation resulted in a net increase to the second component of thousand 
page 
table of contents the third component of the allowance for loan losses is an economic component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses caused by portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  and economic trends 
this is management s best estimate of the probable impact that economic changes may have on the loan portfolio as a whole 
the general valuation allowance  including the economic component and unallocated allowance  increased from million at december  to million at december  due to loan growth 
management proactively evaluates economic and other qualitative loss factors used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
after assessing the economic outlook  management did not revise the economic loss factor in due to limited signs of economic change 
economic recovery has been limited and continued financial stress has been experienced by borrowers in our markets 
the persistently high unemployment rate and restrained spending by consumers and businesses are expected to prevent rapid economic expansion and recovery of housing prices

the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that mitigates our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid

table of contents capital adequacy as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the bank s capital ratios are above regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized and bancorp s ratios exceed the required minimum ratios for capital adequacy purposes 
the bank s total risk based capital ratio increased from at december  to at december   primarily due to the accumulation of net income of the bank in of million  partially offset by the effect of growth in total risk weighted assets driven mainly by the loan portfolio purchased from the acquisition and increases in investment securities 
bancorp s total risk based capital ratio decreased from at december  to at december   primarily due to an increase in total risk weighted assets  partially offset by the accumulation of net income of bancorp of million in  net of million dividends paid to stockholders 
we expect to maintain strong capital levels 
our potential sources of capital include future earnings and shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 
in addition  the warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock remains outstanding 
the warrant  if exercised  would provide us with million additional tier capital 
we are also positioned to access capital markets  if necessary  for up to million through a shelf registration filed on form s in the fourth quarter of liquidity the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet both loan demand and unexpected deposit withdrawals 
we accomplish this goal by maintaining an appropriate level of liquid assets  and formal lines of credit with the fhlb  frb and correspondent banks that enable us to borrow funds as needed 
our asset liability management committee alco  which is comprised of certain directors of the bank  is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies 
management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
alco has also developed a contingency plan should liquidity drop unexpectedly below internal requirements 
we obtain funds from the repayment and maturity of loans as well as deposit inflows  investment security maturities and paydowns  federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and other borrowings 
our primary uses of funds are the origination of loans  the purchase of investment securities  withdrawals of deposits  maturity of certificate of deposits  repayment of borrowings and dividends to stockholders 
we must retain and attract new deposits  which depends upon the variety and effectiveness of our customer account products  service and convenience  and rates paid to customers  as well as our financial strength 
any long term decline in retail deposit funding would adversely impact our liquidity 
management does not anticipate significant reliance on federal funds purchased and fhlb advances in the near future  as our core deposit inflow has provided adequate liquidity to fund our operations 
if we were to rely on federal funds purchased or fhlb advances in the future  we expect to have the ability to post adequate collateral for such funding requirements 
as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows  the sources of liquidity vary between periods 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million  an increase of million over december  the primary sources of funds during included a million net increase in deposits  million of cash received from the acquisition  million in pay downs and maturities of investment securities  and million net cash provided by operating activities 
the primary uses of funds were million for investment securities purchases  million in repayment of fhlb borrowings  and million in loan originations net of principal collections 
the banking industry  as a whole  is experiencing diminished loan demand from qualified borrowers 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and unpledged available for sale securities maturing within one year totaled million 
the remainder of the unpledged available for sale securities portfolio of million provides additional liquidity 
these liquid assets equaled of our assets at december   compared to at december   well in excess of our internal liquidity policy 
the increased liquidity at december  was primarily due to deposit growth exceeding loan growth and cash received from the acquisition 
page 
table of contents we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents on hand and other sources of funds will provide adequate liquidity for our operating  investing and financing needs and our regulatory liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future 
management monitors our liquidity position daily  balancing loan funding payments with changes in deposit activity and overnight investments 
our emphasis on local deposits combined with our equity to assets ratio  provides a very stable funding base 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have substantial additional borrowing capacity including unsecured lines of credit totaling million with correspondent banks 
further  on march   we pledged a certain residential loan portfolio that increased our borrowing capacity with the frbsf  which totaled million at december  as of december   there is no debt outstanding to correspondent banks or the frbsf 
we are also a member of the fhlb and have a line of credit secured under terms of a blanket collateral agreement by a pledge of essentially all of our financial assets in the amount of million  of which million was available at december  borrowings under the line are limited to eligible collateral 
the interest rates on overnight borrowings with both correspondent banks and the fhlb are determined daily and generally approximate the federal funds target rate 
undisbursed loan commitments  which are not reflected on the consolidated statement of condition  totaled million at december  at rates ranging from to 
this amount included million under commercial lines of credit these commitments are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards  million under revolving home equity lines  million under undisbursed construction loans  million under personal and other lines of credit  and a remaining million under standby letters of credit 
these commitments  to the extent used  are expected to be funded primarily through the repayment of existing loans  deposit growth and existing balance sheet liquidity 
over the next twelve months  million of time deposits will mature 
we expect these funds to be replaced with new time or savings accounts 
since bancorp is a holding company and does not conduct regular banking operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends from the bank 
under the california financial code  payment of a dividend from the bank to bancorp is restricted to the lesser of the bank s retained earnings or the amount of the bank s undistributed net profits from the previous three fiscal years 
the primary uses of funds for bancorp are stockholder dividends and ordinary operating expenses 
at december   bancorp held million of cash and approximately million of the bank s retained earnings is available to be distributed to bancorp 
when combined  these funds are deemed sufficient to cover bancorp s operational needs and cash dividends to shareholders for the next twelve months 
management anticipates that there will be sufficient earnings at the bank level to provide dividends to bancorp to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the risk is inherent in our deposit and lending activities 
management  together with alco  has sought to manage rate sensitivity and maturities of assets and liabilities to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
additionally  interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on our net interest margin 
interest rate changes can create fluctuations in the net interest margin due to an imbalance in the timing of repricing or maturity of assets or liabilities 
interest rate risk exposure is managed with the goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate volatility on the net interest margin 
activities in asset and liability management include  but are not limited to  lending  borrowing  accepting deposits and investing in securities 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset and liability management 
sensitivity of net interest income nii to interest rate changes results from differences in the maturity or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of our assets and liabilities is managed with the objective of correlating the movements of interest rates on loans and investments with those of deposits and borrowings 
the asset and liability policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of change to nii in changing interest rate environments 
we use simulation models to forecast nii 
from time to time  we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges to mitigate the changes in the fair value of specified long term fixed rate loans and firm commitments to enter into long term fixed rate loans caused by changes in interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by the alco and the board of directors 
they utilize interest rate sensitivity simulation models as a tool for achieving these objectives and for developing ways in which to improve profitability 
a simplified statement of condition is prepared on a quarterly basis as a starting point  using as inputs  actual loans  investments  borrowings and deposits 
if potential changes to net equity value and net interest income resulting from hypothetical interest changes are not within the limits established by the board of directors  management may adjust the asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within approved limits 
page 
table of contents to measure the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market rates  we rely on a sophisticated simulation model 
at december   the model indicated that we had low interest rate risk and we were slightly asset sensitive in a rising interest rate environment 
in  our asset sensitivity increased from the rise in liquidity and variable rate loans 
that asset sensitivity was partially offset by the increase in investment securities and interest bearing transactions  savings and money market deposit accounts 
as shown in table below  if the market rates rise by more than basis points  we expect asset sensitivity to increase as our loans with interest rates on floors will start to float again and net interest income will increase 
in the following simulation of nii under various interest rate scenarios  the simplified statement of condition is processed against four interest rate change scenarios  in basis point increments 
as the federal funds target rate at december  was already at its historic low of  it is unlikely that there will be further reductions in the target rate 
therefore  a reduction in rate scenario is not considered in the following table at december  each of these scenarios assumes that the change in interest rates is immediate and interest rates remain at the new levels 
table summarizes the effect on nii due to changing interest rates as measured against the flat rate scenario 
table effect of interest rate change on net interest income at december  changes in interest estimated change in nii rates in basis points as percent of nii up up up up the above table estimates the impact of interest rate changes 
the estimated changes are within our policy guidelines established by alco 
the results shown reflect a lag in the upward re pricing of loans due to loans on floors 
as stated previously in the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business of this report  the dodd frank act repealed the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts beginning july  we have not incurred significant interest expense on business transaction accounts since the legislation took effect in july if we are to pay interest on certain deposits that are currently non interest bearing  causing these deposits to become rate sensitive in the future  we will become less asset sensitive than the model currently indicates 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
as with any simulation model or other method of measuring interest rate risk  certain limitations are inherent in the process 
for example  although certain of our assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react differently to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the changes in interest rates on certain categories of either our assets or liabilities may precede or lag changes in market interest rates 
further  the actual rates and timing of prepayments on loans and investment securities could vary significantly from the assumptions used in the various scenarios 
lastly  changes in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the yield curve could produce different results from those presented in the table 
accordingly  the results presented should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates
