table of contents recent developments issuing bank diversification we are pursuing a bank diversification strategy pursuant to which we intend to distribute our card issuing activities across at least three issuing banks  in addition to the banks that issue our payroll cards 
we are focused on doing so in a manner that balances our diversification strategy with the protection of existing cardholder and direct deposit relationships and other operational considerations 
in furtherance of this strategy we entered into an agreement with the bancorp bank bancorp in january pursuant to which bancorp will serve as an issuing bank for our new and existing card programs 
bancorp began issuing our cards in a pilot program in april and began issuing cards as part of a commercial roll out in october we are working diligently with bancorp on a more extensive rollout 
we are also continuing our discussions with other prospective issuing banks 
in may  we amended our agreement with inter national bank inb to extend the date by which we agreed to transition the gpr cards issued by inb to another bank from july to september we are in the process of transitioning the distributors of cards issued by inb to another issuing bank and we are currently operating under the wind down provisions of our agreement with inb

key business metrics as a leading provider of gpr cards and related alternative financial services to underbanked consumers  we evaluate a number of business metrics to monitor our performance and manage our business 
we believe the following metrics are the primary indicators of our performance 
number of active cards represents the total number of our gpr cards that have had a pin or signature based purchase transaction  a load transaction at a retailer location or an atm withdrawal within three months of the date of determination 
we had approximately million active cards as of december  and  respectively  and million active cards as of december  
table of contents number of active cards with direct deposit represents the number of our active cards that have had a direct deposit load within three months of the date of determination 
we had   and  direct deposit active cards as of december   and  respectively 
our strategy is to focus on increasing the number of cards that receive direct deposits because cardholders who use direct deposit generate more revenue for us than those who do not 
additionally  consumers who receive direct deposits tend to remain in our programs longer than non direct deposit cardholders 
percentage of active cards with direct deposit represents the percentage of our active gpr cards that have had a direct deposit load within three months of the date of determination 
the percentage of our active cards that were direct deposit active cards as of december   and  was  and  respectively

approximately  and of the gross dollar volume for the years ended december   and  respectively  was made using active cards with direct deposit

table of contents a significant portion of our business is conducted through retail distributors that provide load and reload services to cardholders at their locations 
members of our distribution and reload network collect our cardholders funds and remit them by electronic transfer to our issuing banks for deposit in the cardholder accounts 
our issuing banks typically receive our cardholders funds no earlier than three business days after they are collected by the retailer 
if any retailer fails to remit our cardholders funds to our issuing banks  we typically reimburse our issuing banks for the shortfall created thereby 
we manage the risk associated with this process through a formalized set of credit standards  volume limits and deposit requirements for certain retailers and by typically maintaining the right to offset any settlement shortfall against the commissions payable to the relevant retailer 
we have not experienced any significant losses associated with settlement failures and we have not recorded a settlement guarantee liability as of december  as of december   our estimated gross settlement exposure was million 
our cardholders can in some circumstances incur charges in excess of the funds available in their accounts and are liable for the resulting overdrawn account balance 
although we generally decline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available balance in a cardholder s account  the application of the networks rules and regulations  the timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of subscription  maintenance or other fees can  among other things  result in overdrawn card accounts 
we also provide  as a courtesy and at our discretion  certain cardholders with a cushion which allows them to overdraw their card accounts by up to in addition  eligible cardholders may enroll in our issuing banks overdraft protection programs and fund transactions that exceed the available balance in their accounts

this lease expires in other long term obligations consist of required minimum future payments under contracts with our distributors and other service providers 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or us gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
in other cases management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance because these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates

under our current arrangement with metabank  we would only be entitled to receive interest on cardholder funds if market interest rates rose significantly above current levels 
revenue resulting from these fees is recognized when we have fulfilled our obligations under the underlying service agreements 
we earn revenues from a portion of the interchange fees remitted by merchants when cardholders make purchase transactions using their prepaid debit cards 
subject to applicable law  interchange fees are fixed by the networks 
interchange revenues are recognized net of sponsorship  licensing and processing fees charged by the networks for services they provide in processing purchase transactions routed through them 
interchange revenue is recognized during the period that the purchase transactions occur 
also included in interchange revenue are fees earned from branding agreements with the networks 
stock based compensation we have one stock based employee compensation plan 
we measure stock options at fair value on the date of grant using the binomial lattice model for determining fair value 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including the award type  the employee class and historical experience 
we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options as financing cash flows 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually or at an interim period if events occur or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the associated reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
we assign goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing 
in  we adopted 
table of contents amendments to the guidelines for testing goodwill for impairment contained in accounting standards update asu issued by the financial accounting standard board the fasb 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a subsequent two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it does not need to perform the two step impairment test for that reporting unit 
in the first step of the two step impairment test  the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount 
if the carrying value is less than fair value  no indication of impairment exists and no impairment loss is recorded 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than fair value  a second step in the impairment test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
cardholders reserve we are exposed to losses due to cardholder fraud  payment defaults and other forms of cardholder activity as well as losses due to non performance of third parties who receive cardholder funds for transmittal to our issuing banks 
we have established a reserve for the losses we estimate will arise from processing customer transactions  debit card overdrafts  chargebacks for unauthorized card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery of goods or services 
we establish these reserves based upon historical loss and recovery rates and cardholder activity for which specific losses can be identified 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses 
establishing the reserve for cardholder losses is an inherently uncertain process and the actual losses experienced by us may vary from the current estimate 
income taxes we recognize tax benefits or expenses on the temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutorily enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled 
we are required to adjust our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which tax rates or the provisions of the income tax laws change 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount for which we believe recovery is more likely than not 
we classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense
