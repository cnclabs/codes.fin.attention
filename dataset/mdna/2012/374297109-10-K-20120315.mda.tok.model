table of contents part i item business company profile getty realty corp  a maryland corporation  is the leading publicly traded real estate investment trust reit in the united states specializing in the ownership  leasing and financing of retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals 
our properties are located in states across the united states with concentrations in the northeast and the mid atlantic regions 
our properties are operated under a variety of brands including getty  bp  exxon  mobil  shell  chevron  valero  fina and aloha 
nearly all of our properties are leased or sublet to distributors and retailers who are responsible for the operations conducted at these properties including the payment of taxes  maintenance  repair  insurance and other operating expenses 
we own the getty trademark and trade name in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the united states 
developments regarding marketing as of december   getty petroleum marketing inc marketing was in possession of properties comprising a unitary premises pursuant to a master lease the master lease representing approximately of our  owned and leased properties 
marketing does not itself directly operate the retail motor fuel and convenience store properties subject to the master lease 
rather  marketing generally subleases our retail properties to subtenants that either operate their gas stations  convenience stores  automotive repair services or other businesses at our properties or are petroleum distributors who operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to the operators 
following is a list of important developments regarding marketing following a pattern of late and nonpayment of rent  on november  we sent marketing a notice terminating the master lease on its terms effective december  on december   marketing filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
based on information available to us as of the date of this annual report on form k  we estimate marketing s accrued obligations to us as of the date marketing made its bankruptcy filing to be approximately million 
this aggregate amount consists primarily of unpaid fixed rent and real estate taxes including real estate taxes that we began paying in the first quarter of  which taxes marketing historically paid directly and to a lesser extent other property related expenses which are marketing s responsibility pursuant to the master lease 
these unpaid obligations are considered pre petition claims and subject to discharge by marketing in its bankruptcy proceedings 
we do not expect to collect on any of these pre petition claims and we have fully reserved the amount due from marketing for such claims 
as a result of the developments described above  we concluded that it is probable that we will not receive from marketing the entire amount of the contractual lease payments owed to us under the master lease 
accordingly  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a non cash allowance for deferred rental revenue of million in addition to the million allowance recorded during the quarter ended september  fully reserving for the deferred rent receivable relating to the master lease 
since we no longer believe that marketing will be able to meet its environmental remediation obligations and its obligations to remove underground storage tanks at the end of their useful life or earlier if circumstances warrant  we have accrued million as the aggregate marketing environmental liabilities 
in conjunction with recording the marketing environmental liabilities  we increased the carrying value for each of the related properties by the amount of the related estimated environmental obligation and simultaneously recorded impairment charges aggregating million where the increased carrying value of the property exceeded its estimated fair value 
on march   we entered into a stipulation with marketing and the official committee of unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings the creditors committee  which is subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court the stipulation 
our decision to enter into the stipulation was based on our belief that doing so avoided possible costly litigation  improved our ability to capture cash flow relating to the properties subject to the master lease  minimized disruption to the operations of our properties that could occur from cessation of gas sales by the operators thereof  and 
table of contents permitted us to take greater control of the process for orderly recapture and re letting or other re disposition of our properties 
the stipulation has been filed with the bankruptcy court with notice that a hearing will be held on april  to consider its approval by the bankruptcy court 
no assurance can be given that the stipulation will be approved by the bankruptcy court 
as of march   we have received a total of million in post petition payments from marketing 
of the post petition payments received to date  million has been applied to outstanding receivables accrued for income recognized in the post petition period through december  accordingly  only million of such payments received to date are available to be applied to marketing s contractual rent and real estate tax obligations to us of approximately million attributable to the first quarter of as is the case with respect to the pre petition claims  we do not expect to collect substantially all of the million unpaid amounts attributable to the first quarter of from marketing 
based on a cash flow forecast prepared by marketing and reviewed by the financial advisors to the creditors committee we do not anticipate we will receive amounts materially in excess of the million scheduled for payment on or before april  under the terms of the stipulation 
the deadline for marketing to assume or reject the master lease is april  upon rejection of the master lease  we will take possession of all properties subject to the master lease free and clear of all rights of marketing  and free and clear of all tenancies and occupancies of subtenants subject to whatever rights they may have  if any  under applicable law 
immediately after re taking possession of our properties  it is possible that we might reposition groups of properties in the short term by a entering into temporary short term arrangements with the existing occupants of the properties or operators of groups of properties  allowing them to continue to use and occupy the premises as long as they continue to pay us appropriate compensation and abide by other appropriate covenants  b entering into fuel supply agreements with third party fuel suppliers  c entering into long term leases with distributors engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor products  d disposing of some properties by sale  or e continuing an existing sub lease on a direct basis between such former marketing subtenant and us  whether on substantially the same terms that had previously been in place between such subtenant and marketing or on modified terms 
we intend to remove and reposition our properties from the master lease as promptly as practicable 
we believe the likely outcome of the repositioning process is to create multiple tenancies with respect to the portfolio that was leased to marketing under the master lease 
it is our long term intention to enter into intermediate and long term triple net leases for groups of these properties with tenants who are actively engaged in the business of retail petroleum marketing 
we are continuing our efforts to sell approximately properties that have previously had their underground storage tanks removed and nine petroleum distribution terminals although alternatively we may seek to re let some of these properties and terminals 
while we have dedicated considerable effort designed to increase sales and leasing activity  we cannot predict the timing or the terms of any such dispositions 
following completion of the repositioning process  we expect the revenue realized from the properties that were subject to the master lease to be less than the contractual rent received under the master lease 
in addition  we expect to incur property expenditures and capital expenditures as defined below during and after the repositioning process

risk factors which appears in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  

table of contents the history of our company our founders started the business in with the ownership of one gasoline service station in new york city and combined real estate ownership  leasing and management with service station operation and petroleum distribution 
we held our initial public offering in under the name power test corp 
we acquired  from texaco in  the petroleum distribution and marketing assets of getty oil company in the northeast united states along with the getty name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the united states 
we became one of the leading independent owner operators of petroleum marketing assets in the country  serving retail and wholesale customers through a distribution and marketing network of getty and other branded retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals 
marketing was formed to facilitate the spin off of our petroleum marketing business to our shareholders which was completed in at that time  our shareholders received a tax free dividend of one share of common stock of marketing for each share of our common stock 
marketing was acquired by a us subsidiary of oao lukoil lukoil in december in connection with lukoil s acquisition of marketing  we renegotiated our long term unitary triple net lease the master lease with marketing 
on february   lukoil transferred its ownership interest in marketing to cambridge petroleum holding inc cambridge 
on december   marketing filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
on march  we entered into the stipulation described in more detail below with marketing and the creditors committee seeking an order from the us bankruptcy court and as a result  we expect we will retake possession of our properties commencing in the second quarter of since may  we have acquired approximately properties in various states in transactions valued at approximately million 
these acquisitions have ranged in size from a portfolio comprised of properties with an aggregate value of approximately million up to a portfolio comprised of properties with an aggregate value of approximately million 
in addition  from time to time we acquire individual properties when opportunities arise including through the exercise of purchase options for leased locations or in conjunction with tax free exchanges 
company operations the operators of our properties are primarily distributors and retailers engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor fuel products  convenience store products  and automotive repair services 
over the past decade  these lines of business have matured into a single industry as operators have increased their emphasis on co branded locations with multiple uses 
the combination of petroleum product sales with other offerings  particularly convenience store products  has helped provide one stop shopping for consumers  and we believe has represented an important driver behind the industry s growth 
as of december   we owned properties and leased properties 
nine of the properties we own are petroleum distribution terminals 
as of december   approximately of our  owned and leased properties were subject to the master lease with marketing  which we expect to commence retaking possession of in the second quarter of for additional information regarding marketing and the master lease  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general marketing and the master lease our typical property is used as a retail motor fuel outlet and convenience store  and is located on between one half and three quarters of an acre of land in a metropolitan area 
the properties that we have acquired since are generally located on larger parcels of land 
we believe our network of retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and terminal properties across the northeast and the mid atlantic regions of the united states is unique and that comparable networks of properties are not readily available for purchase or lease from other owners or landlords 
many of our properties are located at highly trafficked urban intersections or conveniently close to highway entrance or exit ramps 
nearly all of our properties are leased or sublet to distributors and retailers engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor fuel products  convenience store products and automotive repair services 
these tenants are responsible for the operations conducted at these properties and for the payment of taxes  maintenance  repair  insurance and other operating expenses related to our properties 
our tenants financial results are largely dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry  which is highly competitive and subject to volatility 
in those instances where we determine that the best use for a property is no longer as a retail motor fuel outlet  we will seek an alternative tenant or buyer for the property 
we lease or sublet approximately of our properties for such uses as fast food restaurants  automobile sales and other retail purposes 
we are self administered and self managed by our management team  which has extensive experience in owning  leasing and managing retail motor fuel and convenience store properties 
we have invested  and will continue to invest  in real estate and real estate related investments  such as mortgage loans  when appropriate opportunities arise 
the sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly competitive  and we compete for tenants with a large number of property owners 
our principal means of competition are rents charged in relation to the income producing potential of the location 
in addition  we expect other major real estate investors with significant capital will continue to compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities 
these competitors include petroleum manufacturing  distributing and marketing companies  other reits  investment funds and private institutional investors 
we generally have long term leases with our tenants 
generally  we seek leases with our 
table of contents tenants that have an initial term of years and include provisions for rental increases during the term of the lease 
as of december   our average lease term exclusive of the properties subject to the master lease with marketing  weighted by the number of underlying properties  was in excess of years excluding renewal options 
retail motor fuel properties are an integral component of the transportation infrastructure 
stability within the retail motor fuel and convenience store industry is driven by highly inelastic demand for petroleum products and day to day consumer goods and fast foods  which supports our tenants 
total revenues included in continuing operations for the year ended december  were million of which revenue contractually due or received from marketing aggregated approximately million 
our financial results are materially dependent upon rental revenue net of related expenses derived from the properties subject to the master lease and the ability of our tenants to meet their rental  environmental and other obligations under their leases with us 
substantially all of our tenants financial results depend on the sale of refined petroleum products and rental income from their subtenants 
subtenants either operate their gas stations  convenience stores  automotive repair services or other businesses at our properties or are petroleum distributors who operate our properties directly or sublet our properties to the operators 
since a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from the properties subject to the master lease  any factor that materially adversely affects the rental revenue we derive from or the expenses we assume related to the properties subject to the master lease may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  revenues  operating expenses  results of operations  liquidity  ability to pay dividends or stock price
