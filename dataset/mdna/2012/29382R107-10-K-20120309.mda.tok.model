item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december   and and consolidated financial condition as of december  and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a diversified spanish language media company with a unique portfolio of television and radio assets that reach hispanic consumers across the united states  as well as the border markets of mexico 
we operate in two reportable segments television broadcasting and radio broadcasting 
our net revenue for the year ended december  was million 
of that amount  revenue generated by our television segment accounted for and revenue generated by our radio segment accounted for 
as of the date of filing this report  we own and or operate primary television stations located primarily in california  colorado  connecticut  florida  massachusetts  nevada  new mexico  texas and washington  dc we own and operate radio stations fm and am located primarily in arizona  california  colorado  florida  nevada  new mexico and texas 
our television and radio stations typically have local websites and other digital and interactive media platforms that provide users with news and information as well as a variety of other products and services 
we generate revenue primarily from sales of national and local advertising time on television and radio stations  and from retransmission consent agreements 
advertising rates are  in large part  based on each medium s ability to attract audiences in demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
we recognize advertising revenue when commercials are broadcast 
we do not obtain long term commitments from our advertisers and  consequently  they may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalties 
we pay commissions to agencies for local  regional and national advertising 
for contracts directly with agencies  we record net revenue from these agencies 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the broadcasting industry and are due primarily to variations in advertising expenditures by both local and national advertisers 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years resulting from political advertising and every four years resulting from advertising aired during the world cup and 
we also generate revenue from retransmission consent agreements that are entered into with mvpds 
we refer to such revenue as retransmission consent revenue  which represents payments from mvpds for access to our television station signals so that they may rebroadcast our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming 
we recognize retransmission consent revenue when it is accrued pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with respect to such revenue 
our primary expenses are employee compensation  including commissions paid to our sales staff and amounts paid to our national representative firms  as well as expenses for marketing  promotion and selling  technical  local programming  engineering  and general and administrative 
our local programming costs for television consist primarily of costs related to producing a local newscast in most of our markets 
the comparability of our results between and is affected by acquisitions in those periods 
in those years  we primarily acquired new media properties in markets where we already owned existing media properties 
while new media properties contribute to the financial results of their markets  we do not attempt to measure their effect as they typically are integrated into existing operations 

table of contents highlights during  we faced challenging comparisons to  when we benefited from world cup and political advertising revenue and revenue from a large los angeles promotional event  whereas revenue from these and other similar periodically occurring revenue sources either did not occur or were not material in net revenue decreased to million  a decrease of million  or  from million in nevertheless  our audience shares remain strong in the nation s most densely populated hispanic markets 
net revenue for our television segment decreased to million in  from million in this decrease of million  or  in net revenue  was primarily due to a decrease in national advertising  the non occurrence of advertising revenue from the world cup in compared to and a decrease in political advertising revenue  which was not material in  partially offset by an increase in retransmission consent revenue 
we generated a total of million of retransmission consent revenue in we anticipate that retransmission consent revenue for the full year will be greater than it was for the full year and will continue to be a growing source of net revenue in future periods 
net revenue for our radio segment decreased to million in  from in this decrease of million  or  was primarily due to the non occurrence of advertising revenue from the world cup in compared to and a decrease in political advertising revenue  which was not material in acquisitions and dispositions on january   we completed the acquisition of ler  a representation firm that sells national spots and digital advertising to advertising agencies on our behalf and other clients 
we previously owned of ler  which was accounted for under the equity method 
we decided to acquire the of ler that we did not own in order to integrate ler s sales force with our radio operations 
we paid million for the remaining of ler 
as a result of our obtaining control of ler  our previously held interest was remeasured to its fair value of million 
the resulting gain of million is included in the line item other income loss on the consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluated the transferred set of activities  assets  inputs and processes applied to these inputs in this acquisition and determined that the acquisition did constitute a business 
currently  we are subject to certain limitations on acquisitions under the terms of the indenture and the amended credit agreement 
please see liquidity and capital resources below 
in a strategic effort to focus our resources on strengthening existing clusters and expanding into new us hispanic markets  we periodically review our portfolio of media properties and  from time to time  seek to divest assets in markets where we do not see the opportunity to grow to scale and build out media clusters  subject to limitations contained in our amended credit agreement

table of contents results of operations separate financial data for each of the company s operating segments is provided below 
segment operating profit loss is defined as operating profit loss before corporate expenses  loss gain on sale of assets and impairment charge 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on the following in thousands years ended december  change to change to net revenue television radio consolidated direct operating expenses television radio consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses television radio consolidated depreciation and amortization television radio consolidated segment operating profit television radio consolidated corporate expenses impairment charge operating income loss consolidated adjusted ebitda capital expenditures television radio consolidated total assets television radio consolidated percentage not meaningful 
consolidated adjusted ebitda means net income loss plus gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses  net interest expense  other income loss  gain loss on debt extinguishment  income tax 
table of contents expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments 
we use the term consolidated adjusted ebitda because that measure is defined in our syndicated bank credit facility and does not include gain loss on sale of assets  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation  net interest expense  other income loss  gain loss on debt extinguishment  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments 
since our ability to borrow from our credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the maximum total leverage ratio  maximum revolving credit leverage ratio  minimum cash interest coverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum total leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our credit facility 
under the amended credit agreement  our maximum total leverage ratio may not exceed to the total leverage ratio was as follows in each case as of december  to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income 
as consolidated adjusted ebitda excludes non cash gain loss on sale of assets  non cash depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charge  non cash stock based compensation expense  net interest expense  other income loss  gain loss on debt extinguishment  income tax expense benefit  equity in net income loss of nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used to make executive compensation decisions 

table of contents consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is cash flows from operating activities

subject to certain exceptions  both the indenture and the amended credit agreement contain various provisions that limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  merge  dissolve  consolidate  or sell all or substantially all of our assets  make certain investments  make certain restricted payments  declare certain dividends or distributions or repurchase shares of our capital stock  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and change the nature of our business 
in addition  the indenture contains various provisions that limit our ability to apply the proceeds from certain asset sales other than in accordance with the terms of the indenture  and restrict dividends or other payments from subsidiaries 
in addition  the amended credit agreement contains various provisions that limit our ability to dispose of certain assets  and amend our or any guarantor s organizational documents of the company in any way that is materially adverse to the lenders under our credit facility 
moreover  if we fail to comply with any of the financial covenants or ratios under our credit facility  our lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed to be immediately due and payable  together with accrued and unpaid interest  and or terminate their commitments  if any  to make further extensions of credit 
in addition  if our total leverage ratio exceeds to as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter  the maximum principal outstanding amount of all loans under our credit facility cannot exceed million 
in the event that the maximum principal outstanding amount exceeds million in that case  we must immediately prepay outstanding revolving loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess 

table of contents in february  we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement 
pursuant to this amendment  among other things  our total leverage ratio may not exceed to in future periods 
in addition  on or after march   the financial covenants shall not be applicable unless any loans are outstanding on the relevant date 
the amendment also contains other provisions that are customary for an agreement of this type 
debt and equity financing on november   our board of directors approved a million stock repurchase program 
we were authorized to repurchase up to million of our outstanding class a common stock from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing market prices  block trades and private repurchases 
on april   our board of directors approved an additional million stock repurchase program 
we have repurchased a total of million shares of class a common stock for approximately million under both plans from inception through december  we did not repurchase any shares of class a common stock during or subject to certain exceptions  both the indenture and the amended credit agreement contain various provisions that limit our ability to make future repurchases of shares of our common stock

since our ability to borrow from our credit facility is based on a consolidated adjusted ebitda financial covenant  we believe that it is important to disclose consolidated adjusted ebitda to our investors 
our credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to the maximum total leverage ratio  maximum revolving credit leverage ratio  minimum cash interest coverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the maximum total leverage ratio  or the ratio of consolidated total debt to trailing twelve month consolidated adjusted ebitda  affects our ability to borrow from our credit facility 
under our credit facility  our maximum total leverage ratio may not exceed to the total leverage ratio was as follows in each case as of december  to   to therefore  we were in compliance with this covenant at each of those dates 
while many in the financial community and we consider consolidated adjusted ebitda to be important  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  such as cash flows from operating activities  operating income and net income

table of contents nonconsolidated affiliate  non cash losses and syndication programming amortization and includes syndication programming payments  consolidated adjusted ebitda has certain limitations because it excludes and includes several important non cash financial line items 
therefore  we consider both non gaap and gaap measures when evaluating our business 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is also used to make executive compensation decisions 
consolidated adjusted ebitda is a non gaap measure

commitments and contractual obligations we have agreements with certain media research and ratings providers  expiring at various dates through december  to provide television and radio audience measurement services 
we lease facilities and broadcast equipment under various operating lease agreements with various terms and conditions  expiring at various dates through november 
table of contents our material contractual obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total amounts committed less than year years years more than years notes and related interest media research and ratings providers operating leases and other material non cancelable contractual obligations total contractual obligations these amounts represent estimated future cash interest payments related to our notes 
future interest payments could differ materially from amounts indicated in the table due to future operational and financing needs  market factors and other currently unanticipated events

application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are the most important to the accurate portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies require management s subjective judgment and may produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed and approved our related disclosure in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill we believe that the accounting estimates related to the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets and our estimates of the useful lives of our long lived assets are critical accounting estimates because goodwill and other intangible assets are our most significant assets  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet  as well as on our results of operations  could be material 
accordingly  the assumptions about future cash flows on the assets under evaluation are critical goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
we test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if certain events or certain changes in circumstances indicate they may be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make a series of assumptions about such things as the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 

table of contents goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the fair values of our reporting units to their respective carrying amounts 
we have determined that each of our operating segments is a reporting unit 
if a reporting unit s estimated fair value is equal to or greater than that reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists and the testing is complete at the first step 
however  if the reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than the estimated fair value  the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment of goodwill  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  then an impairment exists and an impairment loss is recorded for the amount of the difference 
we elected early adoption of accounting standards update asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu  for the year ended december  under this guidance  we would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
we performed a qualitative assessment of the television reporting unit in accordance with asu and determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was greater than its carrying amount 
we did not reach a definitive conclusion on the radio reporting unit under asu so we performed the first step of goodwill impairment testing and compared the fair value of the radio reporting unit to its carrying amount 
as of december   we had million of goodwill in our television reporting unit 
we performed a qualitative assessment of the television reporting unit and determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was greater than its carrying amount so we were not required to calculate the fair value of the television reporting unit 
in the prior year  the fair value of our television reporting unit was greater than the carrying value by 
therefore  we do not believe that we are at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test in our television reporting unit for at least the foreseeable future 
if it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount in future periods  we would  at that time  have to proceed to the two step process of goodwill impairment testing 
as of december   we had million of goodwill in our radio reporting unit 
the fair value of our radio reporting unit was greater than the carrying value by 
if the fair value of our radio reporting unit is less than the carrying value in future periods  we would  at that time  have to proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment testing process 
the estimated fair value of goodwill is determined by using a combination of a market approach and an income approach 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying sales  earnings and cash flow multiples to each reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics to our reporting units 
the market approach requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as selecting comparable companies and comparable transactions and transaction premiums 
the current economic conditions have led to a decrease in the number of comparable transactions  which makes the market approach of comparable transactions and transaction premiums more difficult to estimate than in previous years 
the income approach estimates fair value based on our estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  which reflect the overall level of inherent risk of that reporting unit 
the income approach also requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as discount rates  revenue projections  profit margin projections and terminal value multiples 
we estimated our discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
these comparable publicly traded companies have similar size  operating characteristics and or financial profiles to us 
we also estimated the terminal value multiple based on comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
we estimated our revenue projections and profit margin projections based on internal forecasts about future performance 

table of contents the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions potentially could have an adverse effect on the capital markets  which would affect the discount rate assumptions  terminal value estimates  transaction premiums and comparable transactions 
such economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations  which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
furthermore  such economic conditions could have a negative impact on the advertising industry in general or the industries of those customers who advertise on our stations  including  among others  the automotive  financial and other services  telecommunications  travel and restaurant industries  which in the aggregate provide a significant amount of our historical and projected advertising revenue 
the activities of our competitors  such as other broadcast television stations and radio stations  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
changes in technology or our audience preferences  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  such as internet  social media and broadband content providers serving the same markets  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
finally  the risk factors that we identify from time to time in our sec reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
given the uncertainties of the current economic environment and the impact it has had  and may continue to have  on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding internal forecasts of future performance of our business as a whole or of our units are not achieved  if market conditions change and affect the discount rate  or if there are lower comparable transactions and transaction premiums  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future change in our assumptions would have an adverse impact on our valuation models and result in impairment  or if it does  whether such impairment charge would be material 
indefinite life intangible assets we believe that our broadcast licenses are indefinite life intangible assets 
an intangible asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life when there are no legal  regulatory  contractual  competitive  economic or any other factors that may limit the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
the evaluation of impairment for indefinite life intangible assets is performed by a comparison of the asset s carrying value to the asset s fair value 
when the carrying value exceeds fair value  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount of the difference 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses represents all licenses owned and operated within an individual market cluster  because such licenses are used together  are complimentary to each other and are representative of the best use of those assets 
our individual market clusters consist of cities or nearby cities 
we test our broadcasting licenses for impairment based on certain assumptions about these market clusters 
we wrote down the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses in our television and radio reporting units to fair value during our annual impairment test 
the estimated fair value of indefinite life intangible assets is determined by using an income approach 
the income approach estimates fair value based on the estimated future cash flows of each market cluster that a hypothetical buyer would expect to generate  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions  which reflect the overall level of inherent risk 
the income approach requires us to make a series of assumptions  such as discount rates  revenue projections  profit margin projections and terminal value multiples 
we estimate the discount rates on a blended rate of return considering both debt and equity for comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
these comparable publicly traded companies have similar size  operating characteristics and or financial profiles to us 
we also estimated the terminal value multiple based on comparable publicly traded companies in the television and radio industries 
we estimated the revenue projections and profit margin projections based on various market clusters signal coverage of the markets and industry information for an average station within a given market 
the information for each market cluster includes such things as estimated market share  estimated capital start up 
table of contents costs  population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures 
alternatively  some stations under evaluation have had limited relevant cash flow history due to planned or actual conversion of format or upgrade of station signal 
the assumptions we make about cash flows after conversion are based on the performance of similar stations in similar markets and potential proceeds from the sale of the assets 
the fair values of our television fcc licenses for each of our market clusters exceeded the carrying values in amounts ranging from to over 
the fair values of our radio fcc licenses for each of our market clusters exceeded the carrying values in amounts ranging from to 
the continuation or worsening of current economic conditions potentially could have an adverse effect on the capital markets  which would affect the discount rate assumptions  terminal value estimates  transaction premiums and comparable transactions 
such economic conditions could also have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business and results of operations  which would affect our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
furthermore  such economic conditions could have a negative impact on the advertising industry in general or the industries of those customers who advertise on our stations  including  among others  the automotive  financial and other services  telecommunications  travel and restaurant industries  which in the aggregate provide a significant amount of our historical and projected advertising revenue 
the activities of our competitors  such as other broadcast television stations and radio stations  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance and terminal value estimates 
changes in technology or our audience preferences  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  such as internet  social media and broadband content providers serving the same markets  could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
finally  the risk factors that we identify from time to time in our sec reports could have an adverse effect on our internal forecasts about future performance  terminal value estimates and transaction premiums 
given the uncertainties of the current economic environment and the impact it has had  and may continue to have  on our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purposes of our impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding internal forecasts of future performance of our business as a whole or of our units are not achieved  if market conditions change and affect the discount rate  or if there are lower comparable transactions and transaction premiums  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future change in our assumptions would have an adverse impact on our valuation models and result in impairment  or if it does  whether such impairment charge would be material 
long lived assets  including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances  such as the passage of new laws or changes in regulations  technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 

table of contents deferred taxes deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is determined to be more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
revenue recognition television and radio revenue related to the sale of advertising is recognized at the time of broadcast 
revenue contracts with advertising agencies are recorded at an amount that is net of the commission retained by the agency 
revenue from contracts that we enter into directly with our advertisers is recorded at gross revenue and the related commission or national representation fee is recorded in operating expense 
cash payments received prior to services rendered result in deferred revenue  which is then recognized as revenue when the advertising time or space is actually provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable consist of a homogeneous pool of relatively small dollar amounts from a large number of customers 
we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
derivative instruments asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires us to recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  and further  on the type of hedging relationship 
the carrying amount of our interest rate swap agreements is recorded at fair market value  including non performance risk  and any changes to the value are recorded as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
the fair market value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined by using multiple broker quotes  adjusted for non performance risk  which estimate the future discounted cash flows of any future payments that may be made under such agreements 
for the year ended december   we recognized a decrease of million in interest expense related to the increase in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements 
we terminated the interest rate swap agreements effective july   so there is no balance as of december  and 
table of contents additional information for additional information on our significant accounting policies  please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu 
the guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity of critical accounting estimates we have critical accounting estimates that are sensitive to change 
the most significant of those sensitive estimates relate to the impairment of intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually on october for impairment  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  we must make assumptions about the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
television in calculating the estimated fair value of our television fcc licenses  we used models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
the estimates of future cash flows assume that the television segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in the television expenses  and therefore the television assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
we conducted a review of our television indefinite life intangible assets by using an income approach

the information for each market cluster includes such things as estimated market share  estimated capital start up costs  population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures 
based on the assumptions and estimates described above  we did not record impairment in as the fair values of our television fcc licenses for each of our market clusters was greater than their respective carrying values 
the fair values exceeded the carrying values in amounts ranging from to over 
we recognized impairment charges of million relating to television fcc licenses in we conducted our annual review of our television reporting unit in accordance with asu and determined that it is more likely than not that its fair value is greater than its carrying amount 
during our qualitative assessment  we considered adverse events or circumstances which could affect the fair value of our 
table of contents television reporting unit 
we considered macroeconomic conditions  the broadcasting industry  the spanish language advertising industry  cost factors  our financial performance  our share price and other relevant events in our analysis 
we also took into consideration that the fair value of our television reporting unit was greater than the carrying value by in the prior year impairment testing 
based on our analysis  we determined that it is more likely than not that our television reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value so no impairment of goodwill was recorded 
radio in calculating the estimated fair value of our radio reporting unit and fcc licenses  we used models that rely on various assumptions  such as future cash flows  discount rates and multiples 
the estimates of future cash flows assume that the radio segment revenues will increase significantly faster than the increase in the radio expenses  and therefore the radio assets will also increase in value 
if any of the estimates of future cash flows  discount rates  multiples or assumptions were to change in any future valuation  it could affect our impairment analysis and cause us to record an additional expense for impairment 
we conducted a review of our radio indefinite life intangible assets by using an income approach
