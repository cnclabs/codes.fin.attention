upon closing of the merger  ual corporation became the parent company of both united and continental and ual corporation s name was changed to united continental holdings  inc ual s consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of continental and its subsidiaries for the period subsequent to october  
table of contents integration related accomplishments and key initiatives include during  the company received a single operating certificate from the federal aviation administration the faa  marking a significant achievement in the integration of united and continental 
the certificate gives the faa a single point of oversight for our combined operations 
it also allows all maintenance and operating activities to be considered as united by the faa  in  the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in  the company has co located check in  ticket counter and gate facilities at airports since closing the merger and now has a single area for check in at airports systemwide 
more than aircraft are now rebranded in the new united livery  some key initiatives for the company in include converting to a single passenger service system  harmonizing other information technology systems  moving to a single website  making substantial fleet reallocations around the system and working to integrate certain employee groups 
we currently expect to migrate to a single passenger service system in early march  allowing the company to operate using a single carrier code  flight schedule  inventory  website and departure control system  and ual expects the merger to deliver billion to billion in net annual synergies on a run rate basis in  including between million and million of annual revenue synergies  in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network  fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by the broader network of the company  and between million and million of net cost synergies 
the company has realized an estimated million of synergies in  comprised of million of revenue synergies and million of net cost synergies 
the company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger 
the company incurred approximately million of integration related cash costs in and expects to incur a similar amount in in categories generally consistent with there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses  and many of the expenses that will be incurred are  by their nature  difficult to estimate accurately 
see notes and to the financial statements included in item of this report and item a  risk factors  for additional information on the merger 
operations network 
the company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations  which utilize jet aircraft with at least seats  and its regional operations 
see item  properties  for a description of the company s mainline and regional aircraft 
with key global air rights in the us  asia pacific  europe  middle east  africa  and latin america  ual has the world s most comprehensive global route network 
ual  through united and continental and their regional carriers  operates more than  flights a day to more than us domestic and international destinations from the company s hubs at newark liberty international airport newark liberty  chicago o hare international airport chicago o hare  denver international airport denver  george bush intercontinental airport houston bush  hopkins international airport cleveland hopkins  los angeles international airport lax  ab won pat international airport guam  san francisco international airport sfo and washington dulles international airport washington dulles 
including its regional operations  united operates approximately  flights a day to more than us domestic and international destinations based on its annual flight schedule as of january  including its regional operations  continental operates approximately  flights a day to more than us domestic and international destinations based on its annual flight schedule as of january  
table of contents all of the company s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers  contributing to a large amount of origin and destination traffic 
our hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly 
our hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft 
as discussed under alliances below  united is a member of star alliance  the world s largest airline network 
regional 
the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express  continental express and continental connection 
in the future  the company s regional operations will be branded as united express 
these regional operations are an extension of the company s mainline network 
this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline jet aircraft 
chautauqua airlines  colgan airlines colgan  commutair airlines  expressjet airlines  gojet airlines  mesa airlines  shuttle america  skywest airlines skywest and trans states airlines trans states are all regional carriers  which operate most of their capacity under capacity purchase agreements with united and or continental 
under these capacity purchase agreements  the company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees carrier controlled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics 
the carrier controlled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers  such as crew expenses  maintenance and aircraft ownership  some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg  block hours  departures while others are fixed monthly amounts 
under these capacity purchase agreements  the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees  facilities rent and other costs  which are passed through without any markup 
in return  the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united and or continental  on schedules determined by the company 
the company also determines pricing and revenue management and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats 
while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than of all regional flights  the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service  inc cape air  colgan  gulfstream international airlines gulfstream  skywest and trans states 
under these commercial flying agreements  the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula  while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations 
unlike capacity purchase agreements  under a prorate agreement  the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling  and in most cases  market selection  local seat pricing and inventory for its flights  although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 
financial information on the company s operating revenues by geographic regions  as reported to the us department of transportation the dot  can be found in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
alliances 
united and continental have a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines  which enhance travel options for customers by providing greater time of day coverage to common destinations  additional mileage accrual and redemption opportunities  and access to markets that united and continental do not serve directly 
these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features loyalty program reciprocity  codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier  coordination of reservations  ticketing  passenger check in  baggage handling and flight schedules  and other resource sharing activities 
united is a member of star alliance  a global integrated airline network co founded by united in and the most comprehensive airline alliance in the world 
as of january   star alliance carriers served  airports in countries with over  daily flights 
current star alliance members  in addition to united and continental  are adria airways  aegean airlines  air canada  air china  air new zealand  all nippon airways  
table of contents asiana airlines  austrian airlines  blue  bmi  brussels airlines  croatia airlines  egyptair  ethiopian airlines  lot polish airlines  lufthansa  scandinavian airlines  singapore airlines  south african airways  swiss international air lines  tam  tap portugal  thai  turkish airlines and us airways 
shenzhen airlines  avianca  taca taca and copa airlines copa have been announced as future star alliance members 
in  united  continental and air canada entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a revenue sharing trans border joint venture 
a joint venture agreement was subsequently drafted based on the trans atlantic joint venture agreement among united  continental  air canada and lufthansa 
while the parties already have us antitrust immunity  the canadian competition bureau objected to the joint venture in june and the parties are currently involved in litigation before the canadian competition tribunal which may affect the implementation or the scope of the joint venture 
in  pursuant to antitrust immunity approval granted by the dot  united  continental  air canada and lufthansa entered into a joint venture agreement as full participants covering trans atlantic routes 
between march and july  austrian airlines  bmi and swiss international air lines began participation in the joint venture as part of the lufthansa group 
in november  the dot confirmed brussels airlines is covered as a lufthansa group affiliate within the existing antitrust immunized alliance 
brussels airlines is expected to be integrated into the trans atlantic joint venture during as a part of the lufthansa group 
lufthansa recently announced an agreement to sell bmi  and upon conclusion of that sale  bmi will no longer participate in the joint venture 
the european commission  which has been conducting a standard review of the competitive effects of the joint venture  has not yet completed its review 
the joint venture  which enables the carriers to integrate the services they operate between the united states and europe and to capture revenue synergies  delivers highly competitive flight schedules  fares and service 
the joint venture has a revenue sharing structure that results in payments among full participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on trans atlantic routes to a historic period  or baseline  which is reset annually 
the payments are calculated on a quarterly basis and subject to a cap 
see industry regulation below 
in november  united  continental and all nippon airways received antitrust immunity approval from the japanese government and the dot  enabling the carriers to establish a trans pacific joint venture to integrate the services they operate between the united states and japan  and other destinations in asia  and to derive potentially significant benefits from coordinated scheduling  pricing  sales and inventory management 
the integration of services will also allow the carriers to offer passengers highly competitive flight schedules  fares and services 
we expect to fully implement the joint venture in during  united and continental maintained independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aeromar  aer lingus  avianca  cape air  colgan  copa  emirates  eva air  great lakes airlines  gulfstream  hawaiian airlines  island air  jet airways  qatar airways  skywest  taca  trans states and virgin atlantic airways 
in addition  continental offers a train to plane alliance with amtrak from newark liberty to select regional destinations 
fuel 
aircraft fuel has been the company s single largest operating expense for the last several years 
the table below summarizes ual s fuel cost data during the last three years 
year gallons consumed in millions fuel cost in millions average price per gallon percentage of total operating expense b a a a excludes fuel consumption and cost for continental predecessor prior to october  b calculation excludes special charges identified in note of this report 

table of contents the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company s operations  results of operations and financial position 
to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to obtain a measure of control over prices in the short term  the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations 
to protect against increases in the prices of fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 
the company uses fixed price swaps  purchased call options  collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including heating oil  diesel fuel and crude oil 
the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure such that the company s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 
loyalty program 
united s mileage plus and continental s onepass onepass programs build customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants 
members in these programs earn mileage credit for flights on united  united express  continental  continental express  continental connection  airlines in star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program 
miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our network of non airline partners  such as credit card issuers  retail merchants  hotels and car rental companies 
mileage credits can be redeemed for free  discounted or upgraded travel and non travel awards 
in  the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in onepass is expected to end in the first quarter  at which point united will automatically enroll onepass members in mileageplus and deposit into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to their onepass award miles balance 
the company s loyalty program has the consolidated amended and restated co branded card marketing services agreement dated june   the co brand agreement with chase bank usa  na chase 
under this agreement  loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using co branded credit cards issued by chase 
the co brand agreement provides for joint marketing of the credit card programs and provides chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company s customer database 
in  million mileage plus travel awards were used on united 
these awards represented of united s total revenue passenger miles in also in  million onepass travel awards were used on continental 
these awards represented of continental s total revenue passenger miles in in addition  mileage plus members redeemed miles for approximately million non united travel awards in as compared to  in non united travel awards include united club memberships  car and hotel awards  merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier  among others 
also in  onepass members redeemed miles for approximately  non continental travel awards as compared to  in the increase in the number of non united and non continental travel awards redeemed in was due primarily to an increase in car and hotel redemptions 
total miles redeemed for travel on united and continental in  including class of service upgrades  represented of the total miles redeemed 
distribution channels 
the majority of the company s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems gds 
the growing use of direct sales websites  such as united 
com and continental 
com and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to de commoditize its services  better control its content  make more targeted offerings  retain its customers  enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs 
to encourage customer use of lower cost channels and capitalize on these cost saving opportunities  the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its websites and explore alternative distribution channels 
industry conditions domestic competition 
the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic 
new and existing us carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the united states 
the company s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and  to a lesser extent  other forms of transportation and 
table of contents technological substitutes such as videoconferencing 
competition can be direct  in the form of another carrier flying the exact non stop route  or indirect  where a carrier serves the same two cities non stop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 
air carriers cost structures are not uniform 
among the numerous factors influencing a carrier s cost structure are the carrier s chosen business service model and any reorganization undertaken pursuant to chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
carriers with lower costs may deliver lower fares to passengers  which could have a potential negative impact on the company s revenues 
in addition  future airline mergers or acquisitions may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 
decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines 
in order to remain competitive and to maintain passenger traffic levels  we often find it necessary to match competitors discounted fares 
because we compete in a dynamic marketplace  attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 
international competition 
internationally  the company competes not only with us airlines  but also with foreign carriers 
international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions  joint ventures  restructurings  liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors 
competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation 
the company s ability to compete successfully with non us carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide 
foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries 
in addition  in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights  us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments 
to compensate partially for these structural limitations  us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other s flights and route networks 
see alliances  above  for further information 
seasonality 
the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters  driving higher revenues  than in the first and fourth quarters  which are periods of lower travel demand 
industry regulation domestic regulation general 
all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot 
absent an exemption  no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity 
the dot also grants international route authority  approves international codeshare arrangements  and regulates methods of competition 
in recent years  the dot has proposed and implemented a variety of far reaching and expensive consumer protection regulations dealing with advertising  denied boarding compensation  tarmac delays  and baggage liability 
airlines are also regulated by the faa  an agency within the dot  primarily in the areas of flight safety  air carrier operations  and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness 
the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates  prescribes maintenance procedures  oversees airport operations  and regulates pilot and other employee training 
from time to time  the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment  potentially causing the company to incur substantial  unplanned expenses 
the airline industry is also subject to various other federal laws and regulations 
the us 
table of contents department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security 
see legislation  below 
the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters 
the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail 
labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla 
the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot  faa  doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 
airport access 
access to landing and take off rights  or slots  at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are  or recently have been  subject to government regulation 
federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc washington reagan  john f 
kennedy international airport jfk  laguardia airport laguardia and newark liberty 
in addition  to address concerns about airport congestion  the faa has designated certain airports  including newark liberty  jfk  and laguardia as high density traffic airports and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports  which may include capacity reductions 
additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots may be proposed in the future that could affect the company s rights of ownership and transfer 
legislation 
the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs 
in addition to significant federal  state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to  proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company s operating costs if imposed on the company 
congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations 
past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry  including air traffic control operations  capacity control  airline competition  aircraft and airport technology requirements  safety  and taxes  fees and other funding sources 
congress may also pass other legislation that could increase labor and operating costs 
climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company s costs 
see environmental regulation  below 
in december  the dot issued a final rule intended to enhance airline passenger protections 
the final rule included regulations requiring certain air carriers  including united and continental  to adopt detailed contingency plans applicable to tarmac delays exceeding three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights  subject to exceptions for safety and security 
a carrier s failure to meet certain service performance criteria under the rule could subject it to substantial civil penalties 
in april  the dot issued a second set of consumer protection regulations in the form of a final rule 
this second initiative mandated the amount of compensation carriers must provide passengers when they are denied boarding  imposed regulations requiring carriers to charge the same baggage fee throughout a passenger s entire journey even if on multiple carriers  and expanded the tarmac delay rule to foreign carriers operating to and from the united states 
additionally  since september   aviation security has been  and continues to be  a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action  requiring changes to the company s security processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures 
in december  the faa issued a final rule amending the existing flight  duty  and rest regulations applicable to us air carriers operating under part of the federal aviation regulations 
the provisions under the final rule may require us to make changes to our flight operations that could materially increase our costs 
international regulation general 
international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation 
in connection with the company s international services  the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves 
in addition  the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments  and in some cases  fares and schedules require the approval of the dot and or the relevant foreign governments 

table of contents airport access 
historically  access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved 
these agreements regulate the markets served  the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights 
since the early s  the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all us flag carriers have access to the destination  under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets 
currently  there are more than open skies agreements in effect 
however  many of the airports that united and continental serve in europe  asia and latin america maintain slot controls 
a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports 
london heathrow international airport london heathrow  frankfurt rhein main airport  shanghai pudong international airport  beijing capital international airport  sao paulo guarhulos international airport  tokyo narita international airport and haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations 
the company s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments 
shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements 
depending on the nature of any such change  the value of the company s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 
the us eu open skies agreement provides us and eu carriers with expansive rights  including the right to operate between any point in the united states and the eu 
the agreement has no direct impact on airport slot rights or airport facilities nor does it provide for a reallocation of existing slots or facilities  including those at london heathrow 
because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on the company s business  the overall future impact of the us eu agreement on the company s business cannot be predicted with certainty 
in october  the open skies agreement between the united states and japan became effective  enabling us or japanese carriers to fly between any point in the united states and any point in japan and  in the case of us carriers  beyond japan to points in other countries the carrier is authorized to serve 
the agreement eliminates the restrictions on the number of frequencies carriers can operate and requires governments in both the united states and japan to concur before taking action to regulate a carrier s fares or rates 
however  under the terms of the bilateral agreement  certain points in japan remain slot restricted and only four slot pairs at tokyo haneda international airport are available to us air carriers at this time  none of which is held by united and continental 
environmental regulation general 
the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to surface and subsurface waters  safe drinking water  aircraft noise  and the management of hazardous substances  oils and waste materials 
areas of either proposed regulations or implementation of new regulations include regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases discussed further below  state of california regulations regarding air emissions from ground support equipment  a federal rule making concerning the discharge of deicing fluid and a federal rule making seeking to regulate airport fuel hydrant systems 
climate change 
there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company  including the eu emissions trading scheme ets which is subject to international dispute  environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom s air passenger duty and germany s departure ticket tax  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and the state of california s cap and trade regulations which impacts united s san francisco maintenance center 
in addition  there are land based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects  requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions  and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in  the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets 
in december  the air transportation association  joined by united  continental and american airlines  filed a lawsuit in 
table of contents the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers the united kingdom being the specific implementing country designated to implement the eu ets requirements as they apply to these carriers 
the case was referred to the court of justice of the european union cjeu and  on december   the cjeu issued an opinion that upheld the eu ets 
more than forty non eu countries have gone on record opposing the scheme and based upon this significant international dispute  it is unclear whether or not the inclusion of aviation in the eu ets will be sustained 
if the scheme continues  it will increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits  although the precise cost to the company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables including the company s future carbon emissions with respect to flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits 
management continues to evaluate what the impact would be for the company in while the eu ets is being disputed  the company has met and continues to meet its compliance obligations under the scheme including implementation in of detailed requirements for monitoring and reporting of emissions of carbon dioxide 
as of january   the eu ets required the company to ensure that by each compliance date  it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to flights to and from eu member states in the preceding calendar year 
such allowances are to be surrendered on an annual basis to the relevant government with an initial compliance date of april  for emissions subject to the eu ets in for  the company estimates it will receive from the united kingdom allowances equal to approximately of the company s carbon emissions relative to the base year  leaving a remaining amount that will need to be purchased by the company 
the amount of such allowances provided by the united kingdom is expected to decrease in future years  potentially leaving a greater amount of allowances that may be required to be purchased 
additionally  any increase in the amount of such carbon emissions would require the purchase of additional carbon allowances by the company 
the international civil aviation organization icao is in the process of developing a regulatory program for international aviation greenhouse gas emissions  with the intent to reach international agreement that the icao program would replace regional schemes such as the eu ets 
without an international agreement  there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government  state governments within the us  or foreign governments  to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry  which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions 
the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant  including the potential for increased fuel costs  carbon taxes or fees  or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 
the company is taking various actions to reduce its carbon emissions through fleet renewal  aircraft retrofits  and actions that are establishing the foundation for the commercialization of aviation biofuels 
other environmental matters 
some us and foreign airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise  including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number and scheduling of hourly or daily operations 
in some instances  these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs  and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports 
the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures 
under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  commonly known as superfund  and similar environmental cleanup laws  generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions 
the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions 
environmental cleanup obligations can arise from  among other circumstances  the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites 
future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s business 

table of contents employees as of december   ual  including its subsidiaries  had approximately  active employees 
as of december   united had approximately  active employees and continental had approximately  active employees 
approximately of the combined company s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december  collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla  which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry 
such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date  upon which the contract is considered open for amendment 
the process for integrating the represented employee groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla  the mccaskill bond amendment  and where applicable  the existing provisions of united s and continental s collective bargaining agreements and union policies 
under the rla  the national mediation board nmb has exclusive authority to resolve union representation disputes arising out of airline mergers 
under the mccaskill bond amendment  fair and equitable integration of seniority lists is required  including arbitration where the interested parties cannot reach a consensual agreement  consistent with the process set forth in the allegheny mohawk labor protective provisions or internal union merger policies  if applicable 
pending operational integration  the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated

the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company s business and the forward looking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company s business  operating results  financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
the merger may present certain material risks to the company s business and operations 
the merger  described in item  business  may present certain risks to the company s business and operations including  among other things  risks that we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses and workforces of united and continental  conditions  terms  obligations or restrictions relating to the merger that may be imposed on us by regulatory authorities may adversely affect the company s business and operations  we may be unable to successfully manage the expanded business with respect to monitoring new operations and associated increased costs and complexity  we may be unable to avoid potential liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the merger and integration  
table of contents we may be unable to successfully manage the complex integration of systems  technology  aircraft fleets  networks and other assets of united and continental in a manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers  vendors  suppliers  employees and other constituencies  branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers  and we may experience disruption of  or inconsistencies in  each of united s and continental s standards  controls  procedures  policies and services 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies  innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect  that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or that we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies 
continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results  financial position and liquidity 
aircraft fuel has been the company s single largest operating expense for the last several years 
the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company s operations  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
while the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term  the company cannot predict the continued future availability of aircraft fuel 
at times  due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry  the company has not been able to increase its fares or other fees sufficiently to offset increased fuel costs 
continued volatility in fuel prices may negatively impact the company s liquidity in the future 
the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such fare or fee increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry 
in addition  any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the fuel price increase and may reduce the demand for air travel 
the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs 
however  the company s hedging programs may use significant amounts of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances  may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors 
in addition  significant declines in fuel prices may increase the costs associated with the company s fuel hedging arrangements to the extent it has entered into swaps or collars 
swaps and sold put options as part of a collar may obligate us to make payments to the counterparty upon settlement of the contracts if the price of the commodity hedged falls below the agreed upon amount 
declining crude and related prices may result in the company posting significant amounts of collateral to cover potential amounts owed beyond certain credit based thresholds with respect to swap and collar contracts that have not yet settled 
also  lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares  especially to the extent that reduced fuel costs justify increased utilization by airlines of less fuel efficient aircraft 
there can be no assurance that the company s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against increases or declines in fuel costs or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company s hedging arrangements 
additionally  deterioration in the company s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 
see note to the financial statements included in item of this report for additional information on the company s hedging programs 
economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions 
the airline industry is highly cyclical  and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the 
table of contents strength of the us and global economies 
robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions  including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies  low unemployment levels  strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 
air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times 
in addition  during periods of unfavorable economic conditions  business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel  either due to cost saving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel 
during the global recession in and  the company s business and results of operations were adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand  particularly with respect to the company s business and premium cabin travelers  and a reduction in fare levels 
in addition to its effect on demand for the company s services  the recession severely disrupted the global capital markets  resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable 
while some economic indicators that may reflect an economic recovery have exhibited growth  other economic indicators  such as unemployment  may not improve materially for an extended period of time 
stagnant or worsening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and continued volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  results of operations and liquidity 
if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future  the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 
the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 
the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately one third of its operating revenues  as measured and reported to the dot 
the company s operations in asia  europe  latin america  africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network 
volatile economic  political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives 
in addition  significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies  and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions  may have a material adverse impact upon the company s liquidity  revenues  costs and operating results 
the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 
the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations  including aircraft lease and debt financings  leases of airport property and other facilities  and other material cash obligations 
in addition  the company has substantial non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures  including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 
although the company s cash flows from operations and its available capital  including the proceeds from financing transactions  have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date  the company s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item a  including  but not limited to  substantial volatility in the price of fuel  adverse economic conditions  disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 
if the company s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item a or otherwise  the company s failure to comply with certain financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements  timely pay its debts  or comply with other material provisions of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences  including the acceleration of the company s indebtedness  increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements  the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the company s financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  
table of contents constrained liquidity may limit the company s ability to withstand competitive pressures and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  including increased competition and demand for new services  placing the company at a disadvantage when compared to its competitors that have less debt  and making the company more vulnerable than its competitors who have less debt to a downturn in the business  industry or the economy in general 
the company s substantial level of indebtedness and non investment grade credit rating  as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness  may make it difficult to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms  or at all 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding the company s liquidity 
certain of the company s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 
certain of the company s credit facilities and indentures governing its secured notes impose certain operating and financial covenants on the company  on united and its material subsidiaries  or on continental and its subsidiaries 
such covenants require the company  united or continental  as applicable  to maintain  depending on the particular agreement  minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  minimum liquidity and or minimum collateral coverage ratios 
a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where the company  united or continental  as applicable  may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio 
in addition  the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings 
the company s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control  including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs  and the company may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants  repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing 
the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers  amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment  an event of default would result which would allow the lenders  among other things  to declare outstanding amounts due and payable 
the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such amounts if they were to become due 
in addition  an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or indentures could also result in an event of default under certain of the company s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 
extensive government regulation could increase the company s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight 
compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company 
laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges  both domestically and internationally  have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 
the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations  or laws or regulations enacted in the future  will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 
each of united and continental provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot 
if the dot altered  amended  modified  suspended or revoked these certificates  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the dot is also responsible for promulgating consumer protection and other regulations that may impose significant compliance costs on the company 
the faa regulates the safety of united s and continental s operations 
united and continental operate pursuant to a single air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa 
from time to time  the faa also issues orders  airworthiness 
table of contents directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company 
these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design  manufacturing  maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action 
faa requirements cover  among other things  retirement of older aircraft  security measures  collision avoidance systems  airborne windshear avoidance systems  noise abatement and other environmental concerns  aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft 
these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control atc system utilized by the us government 
during peak travel periods in certain markets  the current atc system s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to short term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic 
in addition  the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth 
imposition of these atc constraints on a long term basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
failure to update the atc system in a timely manner  and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the airline industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company s operations 
in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to  proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed  would increase the company s operating expenses 
access to landing and take off rights  or slots  at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are  or recently have been  subject to government regulation 
certain of the company s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day 
the faa may limit the company s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports  which could affect the company s ownership and transfer rights  and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities  which could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  in  the faa planned to withdraw and auction a certain number of slots held by airlines at the three primary new york area airports  which the airlines challenged and the faa terminated in if the faa were to plan another auction that survived legal challenge by the airlines  the company could incur substantial costs to obtain such slots 
further  the company s operating costs at airports at which it operates  including the company s major hubs  may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund  directly or indirectly 
in some circumstances  such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition 
the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time  or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available 
the company currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers permitted to operate on the route  the capacity of the carriers providing services on the route  or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports 
if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes  such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets 
in addition  competition from revenue sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company s business and assets on the open skies routes 
the company s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining 
table of contents other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or continued in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 
many aspects of the company s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international laws protecting the environment 
future environmental regulatory developments  such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company  including the european union emissions trading scheme subject to international dispute  the state of california s cap and trade regulations  environmental taxes for certain international flights  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and land use planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
in addition  there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry 
the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict  but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 
see item  business industry regulation  above  for further information on government regulation impacting the company 
the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 
the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business  including computerized airline reservation systems  flight operations systems  telecommunication systems and commercial websites  including www 
united 
com and www 
continental 
com 
united s and continental s websites and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information  as well as process critical financial transactions 
these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to events beyond the company s control  including natural disasters  power failures  terrorist attacks  equipment or software failures  computer viruses or cyber security attacks 
substantial or repeated website  reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures or disruptions  including failures or disruptions related to the company s integration of technology systems  could reduce the attractiveness of the company s services versus its competitors  materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights  result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information  and result in increased costs  lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data 
the company s business relies extensively on third party service providers 
failure of these parties to perform as expected  or interruptions in the company s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company  could have an adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company has engaged an increasing number of third party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business  including regional operations  operation of customer service call centers  distribution and sale of airline seat inventory  provision of information technology infrastructure and services  provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs  provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations  among other vital functions and services 
the company does not directly control these third party service providers  although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance 
any of these third party service providers  however  may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company or agreements with such providers may be terminated 
for example  flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via third party gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators 
such disruptions  including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation  may cause the carriers flight information to be limited or unavailable for display  significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users  and impair the company s relationships with its customers 
table of contents and travel agencies 
the failure of any of the company s third party service providers to adequately perform their service obligations  or other interruptions of services  may reduce the company s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers 
in addition  the company s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 
ual s obligations for funding continental s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual s control 
continental has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees  other than the employees of its chelsea food services division and continental micronesia  inc the timing and amount of ual s funding requirements under continental s plans depend upon a number of factors  including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual s control  such as the number of applicable retiring employees  asset returns  interest rates and changes in pension laws 
changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual s funding requirements  such as its liquidity requirements  could have a material adverse effect on ual s financial condition 
union disputes  employee strikes or slowdowns  and other labor related disruptions  as well as the integration of the united and continental workforces in connection with the merger  present the potential for a delay in achieving expected merger synergies  or increased labor costs that could adversely affect the company s operations and impair its financial performance 
united and continental are both highly unionized companies 
as of december   the company and its subsidiaries had approximately  active employees  of whom approximately were represented by various us labor organizations 
the successful integration of united and continental and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating united and continental employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations 
in order to fully integrate the pre merger represented employee groups  the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group 
the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla  the mccaskill bond amendment  and where applicable  the existing provisions of each company s collective bargaining agreements and union policy 
a delay in or failure to integrate the united and continental employee groups presents the potential for delays in achieving expected merger synergies  increased labor costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 
the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable collective bargaining agreements will be achieved 
there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger 
employee dissatisfaction with the results of the seniority integration may lead to litigation that in some cases can delay implementation of the integrated seniority list 
there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slow downs  work to rule campaigns  sick outs or other actions designed to disrupt united s and continental s normal operations  in an attempt to pressure the companies in collective bargaining negotiations 
although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self help  and united and continental can seek injunctive relief against premature self help  such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined 
the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition 
in recent years  the market share held by low cost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase 
the increased market 
table of contents presence of low cost carriers  which engage in substantial price discounting  has diminished the ability of large network carriers to achieve sustained profitability in domestic markets 
airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity  including route systems and the number of markets served 
several of the company s domestic competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves  causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations 
in addition  the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to the global recession 
further  certain of the company s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity  thereby diminishing the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions 
this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation  or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company faces and may to continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation  and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures 
a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs 
most recently  amr corporation  the parent company of american airlines  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in november carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 
both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions 
the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures 
carriers entering into and participating in airline alliances  slot swaps and or joint ventures may also become strong competitors as they are able to coordinate routes  pool revenues and costs  and enjoy other mutual benefits  achieving many of the benefits of consolidation 
open skies agreements  including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan  may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 
there is ongoing speculation that further airline industry consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future 
the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position  including alliances  asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities 
if other airlines participate in such activities  those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities  thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 
increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
following the terrorist attacks on september   the company s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of third party war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly 
the company has obtained third party war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa 
should the government discontinue this coverage  obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms  if such coverage is available at all 
if the company is unable to obtain adequate third party war risk terrorism insurance  its business could be materially and adversely affected 
if any of the company s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event  the company could be exposed to 
table of contents significant liability or loss 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses  whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise  its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the company could experience adverse publicity  harm to its brand  reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident or other catastrophe involving its aircraft  the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners  which may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
an accident or catastrophe involving an aircraft that the company operates  or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company s regional carriers  could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident created a public perception that the company s operations  or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers  are less safe or reliable than other airlines 
such public perception could in turn cause harm to the company s brand and reduce travel demand on the company s flights  or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 
in addition  any such accident could expose the company to significant tort liability 
although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident  and the company s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations  if the company s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it  the company could incur substantial losses from an accident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial position 
the company s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 
due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months  revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year  which are periods of lower travel demand 
the company s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality  but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including  among others  the imposition of excise and similar taxes  extreme or severe weather  air traffic control congestion  geological events  natural disasters  changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 
terrorist attacks or international hostilities  or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities  even if not made directly on the airline industry  could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 
the terrorist attacks on september  involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted each of united s and continental s financial condition and results of operations  as well as the prospects for the airline industry 
among the effects experienced from the september  terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faa imposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry s fleet  significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience  increased insurance costs  substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 
additional terrorist attacks  even if not made directly on the airline industry  or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry 
wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity 
table of contents and results of operations 
the company s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 
an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior  such as severe acute respiratory syndrome  avian flu or hn virus  or other illness  or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by similar public health threats in the future  could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its long lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the company is required to test its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october of each year  or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
in addition  the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
during the years ended december  and  the company performed impairment tests of certain intangible assets and certain long lived assets principally aircraft  related spare engines and spare parts 
the interim impairment tests were due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred 
certain of the factors deemed by management to have indicated that impairments may have occurred include a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues  record high fuel prices  significant losses  a weak us economy  and changes in the planned use of assets 
as a result of the impairment testing  the company recorded significant impairment charges as described in note to the financial statements included in item of this report 
the company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the future due to  among other factors  extreme fuel price volatility  tight credit markets  a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets  unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment  as well as other uncertainties 
the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period 
the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft 
such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances  including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock  or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 
as of december   ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately billion 
the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section 
an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation s stock by more than percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period  which is generally the three year period preceding any potential ownership change 
there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards 
potential future transactions 
table of contents involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock  including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company s convertible debt  repurchase of such debt with ual common stock  issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning or more of ual common stock  or a combination of such transactions  may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section under section  a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of pre ownership change nols that may be used to offset post ownership change taxable income 
this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
any unused annual limitation may  subject to certain limits  be carried over to later years  and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by built in gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change 
this limitation could cause the company s us federal income taxes to be greater  or to be paid earlier  than they otherwise would be  and could cause all or a portion of the company s nol carryforwards to expire unused 
similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes 
the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods 
its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 
ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 
to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a ownership limitation 
this limitation generally remains effective until february   or until such later date as may be approved by the ual board of directors the board of directors in its sole discretion 
the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns or more of ual common stock  unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 
any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred 
this provision of ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock 
in addition  this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company  creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial  which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock 
the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock 
for additional information regarding the ownership limitation  please refer to ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company s website 
certain provisions of ual s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 
certain provisions of ual s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together  the governance documents may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 
certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders 
these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover  but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual s stockholders interests 
while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors  they 
table of contents could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some  or a majority  of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or  they could prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 
the issuance of additional shares of ual s capital stock  including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes  could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders

item legal proceedings 
brazil air cargo investigation on july   state prosecutors in sao paulo  brazil  commenced criminal proceedings against eight individuals  including united s cargo manager  for allegedly participating in cartel activity 
separately  brazilian antitrust authorities initiated an administrative proceeding in order to verify the existence of a cartel among certain airlines for the determination and implementation of a fuel surcharge  including united and its cargo manager 
on january   the economic law secretariat of brazil issued its opinion recommending that civil penalties be assessed against all parties being investigated  including united  to the administrative counsel of economic defense cade  which is charged with making a determination on the matter 
on august   the brazil federal public prosecutor issued an opinion to cade recommending the dismissal of the proceedings against united and its cargo manager  which is currently under consideration by cade 
united continues to vigorously defend itself before cade 
united is currently cooperating with this investigation and continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result 
based on its evaluation of all information currently available  united has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities 
however  penalties for violation of competition laws can be substantial and an ultimate finding that united engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
united injunction against alpa and four individual defendants for unlawful slowdown activity under the railway labor act on july   united filed a lawsuit in the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois seeking a preliminary injunction against alpa and four individual pilot employees for unlawful concerted activity that was disrupting the company s operations 
the court granted the preliminary injunction to united in november  which was upheld by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
alpa and united reached an agreement to discontinue the ongoing litigation over united s motion for a permanent injunction and  instead  the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the conclusion of the ongoing bargaining process for an amended collective bargaining agreement that began on april  by reaching this agreement  the parties are able to focus their efforts on the negotiations for the collective bargaining agreement 
nothing in this agreement precludes either party from reopening the permanent injunction litigation upon days notice or from seeking enforcement of the preliminary injunction itself 
eeoc claim under the americans with disabilities act on june   the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc filed a lawsuit on behalf of five named individuals and other similarly situated employees alleging that united s reasonable accommodation policy for employees with medical restrictions does not comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act 
the eeoc maintains that qualified disabled employees should be placed into available open positions for which they are minimally qualified  even if there are better qualified candidates for these positions 
under united s accommodation policy  employees who are medically restricted and who cannot be accommodated in their current position are given the opportunity to apply and compete for available positions 
if the medically restricted employee is similarly qualified to others who are competing for an open position  under united s policy  the medically restricted employee will be given a preference for the position 
if  however  there are candidates that have superior qualifications competing for an open position  then no preference will be 
table of contents given 
united successfully transferred the venue of the case to the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois 
on november   united filed a motion to dismiss the matter which the court granted on february  on april   the eeoc appealed the dismissal to the seventh circuit court of appeals 
the court heard oral arguments on october  and the parties are awaiting a decision on the appeal 
litigation associated with september  terrorism families of victims of the september   terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline industry 
united and american airlines the aviation defendants  as the two carriers whose flights were hijacked on september   are the central focus of the litigation  but a variety of additional parties  including continental  have been sued on a number of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design and construction of the world trade center towers 
world trade center properties  inc  as lessee  also filed claims against the aviation defendants and the port authority of new york and new jersey the port authority  the owner of the world trade center  for property and business interruption damages 
the port authority has also filed cross claims against the aviation defendants in both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage sustained in the attacks 
the insurers of various tenants at the world trade center filed subrogation claims for damages as well 
by statute  these matters were consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york and the aviation defendants exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks 
in september  united settled the last remaining wrongful death claim in connection with this matter 
in  insurers for the aviation defendants reached a settlement with all of the subrogated insurers and most of the uninsured plaintiffs with property and business interruption claims  which was approved by the court and has been affirmed by the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
the us district court for the southern district of new york dismissed a claim for environmental cleanup damages filed by a neighboring property owner  cedar washington associates  llc 
this dismissal order has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
in the aggregate  claims related to the events of september  are estimated to be well in excess of billion 
the company anticipates that any liability it could ultimately face arising from the events of september  could be significant  but the company believes that it will have no financial exposure for claims arising out of the events of september  in light of the provisions of the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of limiting claimants recoveries to insurance proceeds  the resolution of the wrongful death and personal injury cases by settlement  the resolution of the majority of the property damage claims and the withdrawal of all related proofs of claim from ual corporation s chapter bankruptcy proceeding 
antitrust litigation related to the merger transaction on june   forty nine purported purchasers of airline tickets filed an antitrust lawsuit in the us district court for the northern district of california against continental and ual corporation in connection with the merger 
the plaintiffs alleged that the merger may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the transportation of airline passengers in the united states and the transportation of airline passengers to and from the united states on international flights  in violation of section of the clayton act 
on august   the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction pursuant to section of the clayton act  seeking to enjoin the merger 
on september   the court denied the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction  which allowed the merger to close 
after the closing of the merger  the plaintiffs appealed the court s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit and moved for a hold separate order pending the appeal  which was denied 
the ninth circuit affirmed the district court s denial of the preliminary injunction on may  and  on july   denied the plaintiffs motions for rehearing and for rehearing en banc 
the us supreme court thereafter denied certiorari 
on october   the district court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint in order to  among other things  add a claim for damages 
continental and united filed a motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice which the district court granted on december  the plaintiffs are appealing that dismissal 

table of contents environmental proceedings in  the california regional water quality control board crwqcb mandated a field study of the area surrounding continental s aircraft maintenance hangar in los angeles 
the study was completed in september and identified aircraft fuel and solvent contamination on and adjacent to this site 
in april  continental began environmental remediation of aircraft fuel contamination surrounding its aircraft maintenance hangar pursuant to a workplan submitted to and approved by the crwqcb and its landlord  the los angeles world airports 
additionally  continental could be responsible for environmental remediation costs primarily related to solvent contamination on and near this site 
in  the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets  which required the company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective january  on december   the air transportation association  joined by united  continental and american airlines  filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom s high court of justice challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers as violating international law due to the extra territorial reach of the scheme and as an improper tax 
in june  the case was referred to the court of justice of the european union case c and  on december   the cjeu issued an opinion that upheld the eu ets 
more than forty non eu countries have gone on record opposing the scheme and based upon this significant international dispute  it is unclear whether or not the inclusion of aviation in the eu ets will be sustained 
if the scheme continues  it will increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon allowances 
as of january   the ets required the company to ensure that by each compliance date  it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to flights to and from eu member states in the preceding calendar year 
such allowances are to be surrendered on an annual basis to the relevant government with an initial compliance date of april  for emissions subject to the eu ets in other legal proceedings the company is involved in various other claims and legal actions involving passengers  customers  suppliers  employees and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
additionally  from time to time  the company becomes aware of potential non compliance with applicable environmental regulations  which have either been identified by the company through internal compliance programs such as its environmental compliance audits or through notice from a governmental entity 
in some instances  these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions 
after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the views of legal counsel  the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations

table of contents operating results and or from our anticipated results of operations described in our forward looking statements in this report 
see item a  risk factors  for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 
merger integration 
during  the company received a single operating certificate from the federal aviation administration the faa  marking a significant achievement in the integration of united and continental 
the certificate gives the faa a single point of oversight for our combined operations 
it also allows all maintenance and operating activities to be considered as united by the faa 
in  the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in the company has co located check in  ticket counter and gate facilities at airports since closing the merger and now has a single area for check in at airports systemwide 
more than aircraft are now rebranded in the new united livery 
some key initiatives for the company in include converting to a single passenger service system  harmonizing other information technology systems  moving to a single website  making substantial fleet reallocations around the system and working to integrate certain employee groups 
we currently expect to migrate to a single passenger service system in early march  allowing the company to operate using a single carrier code  flight schedule  inventory  website and departure control system 
ual expects the merger to deliver billion to billion in net annual synergies on a run rate basis in  including between million and million of annual revenue synergies  in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network  fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by the broader network of the company  and between million and million of net cost synergies 
the company has realized an estimated million of synergies in  comprised of million of revenue synergies and million of net cost synergies 
the company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger 
the company incurred approximately million of integration related cash costs in and expects to incur a similar amount in in categories generally consistent with there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses  and many of the expenses that will be incurred are  by their nature  difficult to estimate accurately 
see notes and to the financial statements included in item of this report and item a  risk factors  for additional information on the merger 
economic conditions 
the severe global economic recession in and significantly diminished the demand for air travel  resulting in a difficult financial environment for us network carriers 
ual s financial performance improved significantly in and as a result of improving global economic conditions  the merger  increasing passenger unit revenue and industry capacity discipline 
although we continue to see indications that the airline industry is experiencing a recovery  including stronger demand  increasing passenger unit revenue and improving revenue  we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement 
worsening economic conditions  such as continued european sovereign debt uncertainty  political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east and africa may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in going into capacity 
over the past year  ual leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match market demand and added new routes from its hubs on the east and west coasts to international destinations such as lagos  nigeria  guadalajara  mexico  montreal  canada  port au prince  haiti  providenciales  turks and caicos  shanghai  china  and stuttgart  germany  along with new intra asia routes between its tokyo hub and hong kong and between its guam hub and okinawa  japan 
in addition  for  ual expects to add new routes from its hubs to manchester  uk  buenos aires  argentina  dublin  ireland  and durango  mexico  subject to government approval 
we expect capacity for to be relatively flat compared to should fuel prices increase significantly  we would likely adjust our capacity plans downward 

table of contents additional revenue generating and cost saving measures 
we offer  and intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel  a portion of which will come from unbundling our current product and a portion of which will come from goods and services that we do not presently offer 
the revenues that we derive from these products and services  which are generally referred to as ancillary revenues  typically have higher margins than that of our core transportation services and are an important element of our strategy to sustain the profitability that we achieved in and the unbundling of our current products and services  as well as our additional value added products  offer customers flexibility and choice in selecting the products and services they are willing to purchase 
additionally  we expect to continue to invest in technology that is designed to both assist customers with self service efficiently and allow us to make better operational decisions  while lowering our operating costs 
fuel costs 
fuel prices continued to be volatile in ual s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was in as compared to in if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels  we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs 
in addition  high fuel prices may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in and based on projected fuel consumption in  a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change ual s annual fuel expense by approximately million 
to protect against increases in the prices of fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 
labor costs 
as of december   the company had approximately of employees represented by unions 
we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our employee groups 
the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups  although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the company 
results of operations in this section  we compare ual s results of operations for the year ended december  with ual s results on a combined basis for the year ended december  ual s results of operations for on a combined basis consist of ual s results of operations for  which includes continental s results from october to december   and continental s results from january to september  given the significant level of integration activity in  we believe this presentation of the financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing ual s financial performance in and this presentation differs from the comparison of and results  which compares ual s financial performance year over year excluding the merger impact in  represented by continental successor results in the fourth quarter of non gaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor ual s performance on a consistent basis

capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements 
the company s business is capital intensive  requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets  particularly aircraft 
in the past  the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase  by issuing debt  by entering into capital or operating leases  or through vendor financings 
the company also often enters into long term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal  cargo  maintenance and other required facilities

table of contents contingencies contingent senior unsecured notes ual is obligated under an indenture to issue to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc up to million aggregate principal amount of notes in up to eight equal tranches of million if a triggering event occurs with each tranche issued no later than days following the end of any applicable fiscal year 
a triggering event occurs when ual s ebitdar as defined in the notes indenture exceeds billion over the prior months ending june or december of any applicable fiscal year 
the month measurement periods began with the fiscal year ended december  and will end with the fiscal year ending december  if any notes are issued  the company will not receive any cash 
financial triggering events under the notes indenture occurred at june  and december  and  as a result  ual issued two tranches of million of the notes to the pbgc in january these tranches will mature years from their respective triggering dates with interest accruing from the triggering date at a rate of per annum 
the notes are payable in cash in semi annual installments starting june  and will be callable  at ual s option  at any time at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
these are the first two such occurrences of ual s obligation to issue the notes 
since the issuance of subsequent tranches of the notes is based upon future operating results  ual cannot predict whether future issuances will occur or the timing of any such issuances 
any future issuances of the notes could adversely impact the company s results of operations because of increased charges to earnings for the then fair value of the principal amount of the notes issued and increased interest expense related to the notes 
issuance of such notes could adversely impact the company s liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments 
legal and environmental 
the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business 
management believes  after considering a number of factors  including but not limited to the information currently available  the views of legal counsel  the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience  that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
other contingencies 
many aspects of the company s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal  state and local and international laws protecting the environment 
future environmental regulatory developments  such as climate change regulations in the us and abroad  could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company  including the eu ets which is subject to international dispute  environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom s air passenger duty and germany s departure ticket tax  limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and the state of california s cap and trade regulations which impacts united s san francisco maintenance center 
in addition  there are land based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects  requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions  and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 
as of january   the eu ets required the company to ensure that by each compliance date  it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to flights to and from eu member states in the preceding calendar year 
such allowances are to be surrendered on an annual basis to the relevant government with an initial compliance date of april  for emissions subject to the eu ets in for  the company estimates it will receive from the united kingdom allowances equal to approximately of the company s carbon emissions relative to the base year  leaving a remaining amount that will need to be purchased by the company 
the amount of such allowances provided by the united kingdom is expected to decrease in the future  potentially leaving a greater amount of allowances that may be required to be purchased 
additionally  any increase in emissions would require the purchase of additional carbon 
table of contents allowances by the company 
as the scheme continues to be the subject of international dispute  it is unclear whether or not the inclusion of aviation in the eu ets will be sustained 
management continues to evaluate what the impact would be for the company in off balance sheet arrangements 
an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements 
the company s primary off balance sheet arrangements include operating leases  which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  above  and certain municipal bond obligations  as discussed below 
as of december   the company had cash collateralized million of letters of credit  most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility  and million of performance bonds 
continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate  customs and aircraft financing obligations at december  in the amount of million 
most of the united and continental letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the bonds have expiration dates through as of december   united and continental are the guarantors of approximately million and billion  respectively  in aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon  excluding the us airways contingent liability described below 
these bonds  issued by various airport municipalities  are payable solely from rentals paid under long term agreements with the respective governing bodies 
the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in united s and continental s financial statements 
the leasing arrangements associated with a minority of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases 
the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  above 
continental is contingently liable for us airways obligations under a lease agreement between us airways and the port authority of new york and new jersey related to the east end terminal at laguardia which lease agreement was assigned by us airways to delta air lines  inc delta 
these obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the port authority and the payment of other rentals in respect of the full amounts owed on special facilities revenue bonds issued by the port authority having an outstanding par amount of million at december   and a final scheduled maturity in if both us airways and delta default on these obligations  continental would be obligated to cure the default and would have the right to occupy the terminal after us airways and delta s interest in the lease had been terminated 
increased cost provisions 
in the company s financing transactions that include loans  the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and  in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor  for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law  subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders 
at december   ual had billion of floating rate debt consisting of united s billion and continental s million of debt and million of fixed rate debt consisting of united s million and continental s million of debt  with remaining terms of up to ten years  that are subject to these increased cost provisions 
in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non us entities  with remaining terms of up to ten years and an aggregate balance of billion consisting of united s billion and continental s million balance  we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non us entities to withholding taxes  subject to customary exclusions 
fuel consortia 
the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage 
interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the 
table of contents consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage 
the consortia and in limited cases  the participating carriers have entered into long term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax exempt bonds either special facilities revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds  issued by various local municipalities 
in general  each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds 
as of december   approximately billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which ual participates  as to which ual and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt 
as of december   ual s contingent exposure was approximately million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation 
as of december   united s and continental s contingent exposure related to these bonds  based on its recent consortia participation  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases 
the guarantees will expire when the tax exempt bonds are paid in full  which range from to the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 
united and continental cash flows activities compared to united operating activities united s cash from operating activities decreased by million in as compared to this year over year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles 
united s net income in was million lower than investing activities united s capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
consistent with ual s investing activities discussed above  united s capital expenditures in related to aircraft upgrades across the company s fleet for its international premium travel product as well as various facility and ground equipment projects 
in  purchases of short term investments  net of proceeds  was million 
united did not have any short term investments in this year over year increase was primarily due to the placement of additional funds with outside money managers and movement of liquid assets from cash to short term investments 
also  as of december   united had cash collateralized million of letters of credit  most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility  resulting in an increase in restricted cash  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  above

continental operating activities continental s cash from operating activities decreased by million in as compared to the combined period 
this year over year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles  a decrease in receivables and a decrease in advance ticket sales 

table of contents investing activities continental s capital expenditures were million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  continental acquired aircraft in both and with proceeds from financings that were delivered directly to the manufacturer 
see note to the financial statements in item of this report for information related to these non cash financing and investing activities 
in  purchases of short term investments  net of proceeds  was million  as compared to million in this year over year variance was primarily due to investment of higher cash balances and more funds being placed with outside money managers and moving liquid assets from cash to short term investments

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions 
the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 
passenger revenue recognition 
the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales 
the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united and continental as passenger revenues when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage 
tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines 
non refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight  unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 
fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected 
the fare on the changed ticket  including any additional collection  is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided 
change fees related to non refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company s additional service to modify a previous sale 
therefore  the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 
refundable tickets expire after one year 
the company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage 
these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 
the company recognizes cargo and other revenue as service is provided 
see separate discussion in frequent flyer accounting  below 
frequent flyer accounting 
united and continental have frequent flyer programs that are designed to increase customer loyalty 
program participants earn mileage credits miles by flying on united  continental and certain other participating airlines 
program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non airline partners that participate in the company s loyalty programs 
we sell miles to these partners  which include credit card issuers  retail merchants  hotels  car rental companies and our participating airline partners 
miles can be redeemed for free  discounted or upgraded air travel and non travel awards 
the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

table of contents in the case of the sale of air services  the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles 
the adoption of accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu resulted in the revision of this accounting  effective january  under the company s prior accounting policy  the company estimated the weighted average equivalent ticket value by assigning a fair value to the miles that were issued in connection with the sale of air transportation 
the equivalent ticket value is a weighted average ticket value of each outstanding mile  based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed 
the fair value of the miles was deferred and the residual amount of ticket proceeds was recognized as passenger revenue at the time the air transportation was provided 
the company began applying the new guidance in and determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis 
the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis 
the estimated selling price of miles is computed using an estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value that is adjusted by a sales discount that considers a number of factors  including ultimate fulfillment expectations associated with miles sold in flight transactions to various customer groups 
generally  as compared to the historical accounting policy  the new accounting policy decreases the value of miles that the company records as deferred revenue and increases the passenger revenue recorded at the time air transportation is provided 
the application of the new accounting method to passenger ticket transactions resulted in the following estimated increases to revenue in millions  except per share amounts year ended december  ual united continental operating revenue per basic share nm nm per diluted share nm nm united and continental also each had significant contracts to sell frequent flyer miles to their co branded credit card partner  chase 
in june  these contracts were modified and the company entered into the consolidated amended and restated co branded card marketing services agreement dated june   the co brand agreement with chase 
the company historically had two primary revenue elements  marketing and air transportation  in the case of miles sold to non airline third parties 
the company applied the material modification provisions of asu to the co brand agreement in june when the contract was amended 
after the adoption of asu  the company identified five revenue elements in the co brand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation  use of the united brand and access to frequent flyer member lists  advertising  baggage services  and airport lounge usage together  excluding the air transportation element  the marketing related deliverables 
the fair value of the elements is determined using management s estimated selling price of each element 
the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
accordingly  we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including  but not limited to  discounted cash flows  brand value  volume discounts  published selling prices  number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed 
the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the co brand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered 

table of contents the estimated selling price of miles calculated is generally consistent with the methodology as described above in passenger revenue recognition 
under accounting prior to the adoption of asu  the company used an equivalent ticket value to determine the fair value of miles 
the new guidance changed the allocation of arrangement consideration to the number of units of accounting  however  the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for those units did not change 
the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered 
the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 
pending new or materially modified contracts after january   certain other non airline partners who participate in the loyalty programs and to which we sell miles remain subject to our historical residual accounting method 
the application of the new accounting standard decreases the value of the air transportation deliverable related to the co brand agreement that the company records as deferred revenue and ultimately passenger revenue when redeemed awards are flown and increases the value primarily of the marketing related deliverables recorded in other revenue at the time these marketing related deliverables are provided 
the annual impact of this accounting change on operating revenue will decrease over time 
our ability to project the annual decline for each year is significantly impacted by credit card sales volumes  frequent flyer redemption patterns and other factors 
excluding the effects disclosed in the special revenue item section below  the impact of adoption of asu resulted in the following estimated increases to revenue in millions  except per share amounts year ended december  ual united continental operating revenue per basic share nm nm per diluted share nm nm effective january   ual updated its estimated selling price for miles to the rate at which we sell miles to our star alliance partners participating in reciprocal frequent flyer programs  as the estimated selling price for miles 
management believes this change is a change in estimate  and as such  the change will be applied as a prospective change effective january  the estimated impact of this change is to reduce consolidated revenue by approximately million 
ual accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members  which we referred to as breakage  using the redemption method 
ual reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns 
during the first quarter of  ual obtained additional historical data  previously unavailable  which enabled it to refine its estimate of the amount of breakage in its population of miles  increasing the estimate of miles in the population expected to expire 
both the change in estimate and methodology have been applied prospectively effective  january  ual and united estimate these changes increased passenger revenue by approximately million  or per ual basic share per ual diluted share  in the year ended december  the company s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment 
current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy  or to program rules and program redemption opportunities  may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

table of contents the following table summarizes information related to the company s frequent flyer deferred revenue ual united continental frequent flyer deferred revenue at december  in millions of miles earned expected to expire or go unredeemed impact of change in outstanding miles or weighted average ticket value on deferred revenue in millions in  the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in moving to a single loyalty program will be a significant milestone in the integration of the two airlines 
continental s onepass program will formally end in the first quarter of at which point united will automatically enroll onepass members in mileageplus and deposit into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to their onepass award miles balance 
the company currently does not expect a material impact in redemptions from merging its two loyalty programs 
asset impairments 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually  as of october  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever an indicator of impairment exists 
goodwill as of december  represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of continental s assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger 
all goodwill and other purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to continental s financial statements 
goodwill is measured for impairment by initially comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value  an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 
the company has one consolidated reporting unit 
in  the company estimated the fair value of the consolidated reporting unit using both an income and a market approach 
the income approach computes fair value by discounting future cash flows of the business and is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity  passenger yield  traffic  operating costs including fuel prices  appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions 
the market approach computes fair value by adding a control premium to the company s market capitalization 
the company s fair value exceeded its carrying value under both approaches and no goodwill impairment was recorded in the company is also required to assess the goodwill recorded on the separate financial statements of continental for impairment 
the fair value of continental was determined by allocating a percentage of the fair value of the consolidated company as determined and described in the paragraph above 
the percentage of the consolidated fair value allocated to continental was based on a number of measures  including revenue share  operating earnings share  available seat mile share  revenue passenger mile share and passenger share 
based on these criteria  this resulted in a fair value allocation of such assets to continental and united of and  respectively 
the fair value of continental exceeded its carrying value and no goodwill impairment was recorded as of december  the company s indefinite lived intangible assets include certain international route authorities  take off and landing slots at various airports  airline partner alliances  the ual trade name and logo 
the fair values of the assets for purposes of the annual impairment test were determined using the market and income approaches 
the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market 
we utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available 
the income approach was primarily used to value the international 
table of contents route authorities  airline partner alliances  the ual logo and trade name  and certain airport take off and landing slots 
the income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset 
projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 
in most cases  these indefinite lived assets are separately associated with and directly assignable to each separate subsidiary 
in cases where the asset is shared between separate subsidiaries  the fair value was allocated using the same method as described above for the goodwill impairment test 
any impairment charges resulting from the testing of the fair values of these indefinite lived intangible assets are also assigned to the applicable separate subsidiary 
ual recorded impairment charges for indefinite lived intangible assets of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  continental recorded a million impairment of certain intangible assets related to foreign take off and landing slots due to a change in our slot allocation times 
in  ual recorded a million impairment of its brazil routes primarily due to the open skies agreement between the united states and brazil which may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes 
the valuation of the brazil routes is based on an income methodology using estimated future cash flows from operation of the routes 
in  using an income methodology which was based on estimated future cash flows  united recorded impairment charges of million to decrease the carrying value of its tradename 
the most significant impact on the estimated fair value was a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues due to poor global economic conditions 
accounting for long lived assets 
the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections  including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and  when necessary  the recognition of asset impairment charges 
the company records assets acquired  including aircraft  at acquisition cost 
depreciable life is determined through economic analysis  such as reviewing existing fleet plans  obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets 
older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and continental and the practice of other airlines 
as aircraft technology has improved  useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be years 
residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets 
residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life 
both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company s fleet plan and other relevant information 
a one year increase in the average depreciable life of ual s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately million 
united s aircraft impairments during and were due to aircraft that were grounded or planned to be grounded  or certain aircraft that were not operated by united 
the aircraft impairments primarily related to united s boeing fleet  which united removed from service  and five boeing aircraft  which it removed from service as part of united s capacity reduction plans that were initiated in fair value was estimated using the market approach 
asset appraisals  published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by united in its market value determination 
several impairments of the boeing and aircraft occurred from to due to the weak economy and reduced demand for these particular aircraft  among other factors 
in addition to the boeing and aircraft  in  ual tested five of its owned regional jets  which were leased to a third party  for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of 
table of contents approximately one year 
as a result of this testing  ual recorded impairment charges of million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of december  benefit accounting 
ual s pension plans under funded status was billion at december   nearly all of which is attributable to continental s plans 
funding requirements for tax qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations 
we estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the continental plans during calendar year is approximately million 
the fair value of the plans assets was billion at december   of which billion is attributed to assets of continental s plans 
the following discussion relates only to the continental plans  as the united plans are not material 
when calculating pension expense for  continental assumed that its plans assets would generate a long term rate of return of 
the expected long term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
our projected long term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets  and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets 
the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
we regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the combined ual defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts 
return generating investments include primarily equity securities  fixed income securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds 
risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixed income securities 
the allocation of assets was as follows at december  percent of total expected long term rate of return equity securities fixed income securities alternatives other pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
when calculating pension expense for  we assume that our plans assets will generate a weighted average long term rate of return of 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by an additional basis points from to would increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future pension obligations for the continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of at december  ual selected the discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december  that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 
ual selected the discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december   that would provide the necessary cash flows to match projected benefit payments 
prior to  the discount rate was selected using a cash flow matching technique where projected benefit payments were matched to a yield curve based on high quality bond yields as of the measurement date 
this change increased the discount rate which lowered the present value of the liability by approximately million 

table of contents this approach can result in different discount rates for different plans  depending on each plan s projected benefit payments 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by basis points from to would increase the pension liability at december  by approximately million and increase the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  plan provisions  assumed discount rates  pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
other postretirement benefit accounting 
united s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits  primarily in the us  to retirees and eligible dependents  as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits 
continental s retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility 
eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits  which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement 
plan benefits are subject to co payments  deductibles  and other limits as described in the plans 
the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations  or the plan s funded status  in its financial statements 
other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements 
the company has not been required to pre fund its current and future plan obligations  which has resulted in a significant net obligation  as discussed below 
ual s benefit obligation was billion and billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase is due to changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for ual s plan  such as the decrease in the discount rate 
the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions  including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due 
united s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december  was  as compared to for december  continental s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december  was  as compared to for december  the health care cost trend rate assumed by united and continental for was and  respectively  as compared to assumed trend rate for of 
a increase decrease in assumed health care trend rates would increase decrease ual s total service and interest cost for the year ended december  by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase ual s postretirement benefit liability by approximately million and increase the estimated benefits expense by approximately million 
ual selected the discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december  that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 
prior to  the discount rate was selected using a cash flow matching technique where projected benefit payments were matched to a yield curve based on high quality bond yields as of the measurement date 
this change increased the discount rate which lowered the present value of the liability by approximately million 
detailed information regarding the company s other postretirement plans  including key assumptions  is included in note to the financial statements in item of this report 
actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions 
under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans  those gains and 
table of contents losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense  but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees 
the company s accounting policy for postretirement welfare benefit plans is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable gaap with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
under the corridor approach  amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is required only if  at the beginning of the year  the accumulated gain or loss exceeds of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets 
if amortization is required  the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense 
the corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in postretirement welfare benefit plan expense each year 
since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach  all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees 
at december  and  ual had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of million and million  respectively  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
income taxes the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible 
the company s management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets  and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to form a conclusion  management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences  projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and negative evidence such as recent history of losses 
prior to  the company was in a cumulative three year loss position  which we weighted as a significant source of negative evidence indicating the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
although the company was no longer in a three year cumulative loss position at the end of  management determined that the size and frequency of financial losses in recent years and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still needed on net deferred assets 
if ual achieves significant profitability in  then management will evaluate whether its recent history of profitability constitutes sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of a portion  or all  of the remaining valuation allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short term investments 
the company s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements  depending upon market conditions 
the following table summarizes information related to the company s interest rate market risk at december in millions ual united continental ual united continental variable rate debt carrying value of variable rate debt at december impact of basis point increase on projected interest expense for the following year fixed rate debt carrying value of fixed rate debt at december fair value of fixed rate debt at december impact of basis point increase in market rates on fair value a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
assuming our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments remain at their average levels  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in ual  united and continental interest income of approximately million  million and million  respectively  during commodity price risk aircraft fuel 
our results of operations and liquidity are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 

table of contents to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel  the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 
the company uses fixed price swaps  purchased call options  collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments 
these hedge instruments are based directly on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities like heating oil  diesel fuel and crude oil 
the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure such that the company s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 
some hedge instruments may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floors or swap prices 
however  the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements  and uses swaps or sold puts as a part of a collar on only a portion of the fuel requirement that it does hedge 
the company does not enter into hedge instruments for trading purposes 
the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions

the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
some of the company s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  european euro and 
table of contents japanese yen 
at times  the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for non risk management purposes 
the result of a uniform percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million for the year ending december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses as of december
