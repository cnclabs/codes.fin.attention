item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we believe that we are one of a limited number of manufacturers that provide a seamless  integrated flexible printed circuit and assembly solution from design and application engineering and prototyping through high volume fabrication  component assembly and testing 
we target our solutions within the electronics market and  in particular  our solutions enable our customers to achieve a desired size  shape  weight or functionality of the device 
current examples of applications for our products include mobile phones  smartphones  tablets  consumer products  portable bar code scanners  computer data storage and medical devices 
we provide our solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems such as apple  inc  and to electronic manufacturing services ems providers such as foxconn electronics  inc  jabil circuit  inc  and flextronics international ltd 
our business model  and the way we approach the markets which we serve  is based on value added engineering and providing technology solutions to our customers facilitating the miniaturization of portable electronics 
we currently rely on a core mobility end market for nearly all of our revenue 
we believe this dynamic market offers fewer  but larger  opportunities than other electronic markets do  and changes in market leadership can occur with little to no warning 
through early supplier involvement with customers  we look to assist in the development of new designs and processes for the manufacturing of their products and  through value added component assembly of components on flex  seek to provide a higher level of product within their supply chain structure 
this approach is relatively unique and may or may not always fit with the operating practices of all oems 
our ability to add to our customer base may have a direct impact on the relative percentage of each customer s revenue to total revenues during any reporting period 
we typically have numerous programs in production at any particular time  the life cycle for which is typically around one year 
the programs prices are subject to intense negotiation and are determined on a program by program basis  dependent on a wide variety of factors  including without limitation  expected volumes  assumed yields  material costs  actual yields  and the amount of third party components within the program 
our profitability is dependent upon how we perform against our targets and the assumptions on which we base our prices for each particular program 
our volumes  margins and yields also vary from program to program and  given various factors and assumptions on which we base our prices  are not necessarily indicative of our profitability 
in fact  some lower priced programs have higher margins while other higher priced programs have lower margins 
given that the programs in production vary from period to period and the pricing and margins between programs vary widely  volumes are not necessarily indicative of our performance 
for example  we could experience an increase in volumes for a particular program during a particular period  but depending on that program s margins and yields and the other programs in production during that period  those higher volumes may or may not result in an increase in overall profitability 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed a wholly owned chinese subsidiary to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our products 
our chinese subsidiary provides a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global 
table of contents customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and multi layer flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
in fiscal  we formed a second wholly owned subsidiary in china to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity and we merged these two subsidiaries into one in fiscal in addition  we formed another wholly owned subsidiary in chengdu  china  and in fiscal  completed construction on our third and fourth manufacturing facilities in china as part of our continued capacity expansion initiative 
net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
as of september   we engaged the services of certain non exclusive sales representatives to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
these sales representatives were located throughout the north america  europe and asia 
the variety of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are made to customers outside of the united states  and therefore sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes and delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our irvine  california executive office  singapore regional office and our united kingdom facility are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or rmb for sales made in china 
cost of sales cost of sales consisted of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  gold  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs included all materials and facility costs associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  stock based compensation expense related to such personnel  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost included the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product 
purchased process services related to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by timing of wage increases at our manufacturing facilities  capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements  inflation may occur in countries in which we produce and market wage rate increases may also occur in these countries 
research and development research and development costs are incurred in the development of new products and processes  including significant improvements and refinements to existing products and processes and are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense included commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related and travel costs associated with sales and marketing  program management  corporate development and engineering support groups  sales support  trade shows  freight out  market studies and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative general and administrative expense primarily included personnel related and travel costs associated with finance accounting  tax  internal audit  legal  human resources  information services and executive personnel along with other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  investor relations  board of directors and other corporate office expenses 

table of contents impairment and restructuring asset impairment is the difference between the fair market value  based on the estimated future cash flows of the underlying assets  and the carrying value  or net book value  of the assets 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the underlying assets 
restructuring expense represents severance  relocation  and other costs and recoveries related to the closure or disposal of a business unit or location 
interest income interest income consisted of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents balances and previously held short term investments 
interest expense interest expense consisted of expense incurred on unused line fees on our revolving facilities  interest related to our deferred financing costs and interest on our previously held long term debt 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consisted primarily of the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange and the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
we account for income taxes under the financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowance and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues  which we refer to as net sales  are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards and assemblies  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
an ems provider may or may not be an oem subcontractor 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectability of the related account 
table of contents receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
we report revenues net of an allowance for returns  refunds and credits  which we estimate based on historical experience 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
our estimates of future product demand will differ from actual demand  therefore  our estimates of the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may change  which we will record in the period such determination is made 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we have considered taxable income in prior carry back years  expected future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated 
accounts receivable allowance 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible amounts and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses historically have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  we may not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
the majority of our receivables are concentrated in relatively few customers  therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
warranty reserves 
our warranty period is generally twelve months  though can be as long as thirty six months  depending on the related product 
we provide a warranty reserve for estimated product warranty costs at the time the net sales are recognized 
while we engage in quality programs and processes  up to and including the final product  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of the failed product and the inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing defective parts 
we continuously monitor and analyze product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of replacement vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
long lived asset impairment 
we test for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of long lived assets 
the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considered internally generated information and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 

table of contents the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  there is no impairment 
restructuring charges 
we recognize restructuring charges related to plans to close or consolidate duplicate manufacturing and administrative facilities 
in connection with these activities  we record restructuring charges for employee termination and relocation costs and other exit related costs 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
to the extent that actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  we may be required to revise the estimates of future liabilities  requiring the recognition of additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recognized 
such changes to previously estimated amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed exit plans 
in conjunction with the closure of certain of our facilities during the reporting periods  we estimated the restructuring costs that would result from the closures 
those costs included  but were not limited to  a termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract  b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and c costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
based on our analysis and review of the relevant fasb authoritative guidance  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges composed of severance  relocation  and other costs related to the closure of these facilities  as well as severance costs as a result of a reduction in force at certain of our other facilities 
goodwill 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to i a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  ii unanticipated competition  or iii an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of expected future cash flows for that reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
to date  we have had no impairments of goodwill 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock units rsus and stock appreciation rights ssars granted to employees based on the grant date fair value 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options and ssars granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we utilize the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options and ssars granted 
generally  our calculation of the fair value for stock options and ssars granted under the relevant fasb authoritative guidance is similar to the calculation of fair value under the original guidance with the exception of the treatment of forfeitures 
expected forfeitures of stock options and ssars are estimated based on the historical turnover of our employees 
the fair value of rsus granted is based on the grant date price of our common stock 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including a the expected volatility of our common stock price  which we determine based on historical volatility of our common stock  b expected dividends  which are zero  as we do not currently anticipate issuing dividends  c expected life of the stock option and ssar  which is estimated based on the historical stock option and ssar exercise behavior of our employees  and d risk free interest rate  which is based on observed interest rates zero coupon us treasury debt securities appropriate for the expected holding period 
an award with a market condition is accounted for and measured differently than an award that has a performance or service condition 
the effect of a market based valuation is reflected in the award s fair value on the grant date eg  a discount may be taken when estimating the fair value of an rsu to reflect the market condition 
the fair value may be lower than the fair value of an identical award that has only a service or performance condition because those awards will not include a discount on the fair value 
all compensation costs for awards that have only a market condition will be recognized if the requisite service period is fulfilled  even if the market condition is never satisfied 
in the future  we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss

see item a of part i  risk factors 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to increased net sales into our smartphone and tablet sectors  partially offset by decreased net sales into our consumer electronics sector  as further quantified below 
net sales into our smartphones sector increased to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase of million  or  was due to higher sales volumes to two of our major customers in this sector 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  our smartphones sector accounted for approximately and of total sales  respectively 
net sales into our tablets sector increased to million for the fiscal year ended september   from million for the fiscal year ended september  the increase of million was primarily due to higher content on average of coupled with higher volume of as a result of increased demand for products from one of our key customers in this sector 
sales into our tablets sector began to ramp in the second fiscal quarter of and continued to grow through fiscal for the fiscal years ended september  and  our tablets sector accounted for approximately and of total net sales  respectively 
net sales into our consumer electronics sector decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to one of our customer s programs  which incorporates our flex assembly  reaching the end of its life cycle 
shipments into our consumer electronics sector accounted for approximately and of total net sales for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to for the fiscal year ended september   from for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of was primarily attributable to the appreciation of the chinese yuan accounting for approximately basis points  wage rate and benefits increases in china accounting for approximately basis points  increased depreciation expenses accounting for approximately basis points

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense increased by million to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september   an increase of 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales commissions due to higher sales volume 
as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expense remained flat in the fiscal year ended september  when compared to the fiscal year ended september  general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased by million to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of 
the decrease was attributable to a million reduction in stock based compensation expense primarily related to the reversal of expenses for performance based awards that were deemed not probable to vest  a reduction of million in wages and benefits as part of our fiscal restructurings  a decrease of million of audit  tax and legal fees  a reduction of million in insurance costs and a net decrease of million in other general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expense decreased to for the fiscal year ended september   from in the fiscal year ended september   attributable to the favorable leveraging impact on our operating expenses from the increased net sales and the decreases described above 
impairment and restructuring 
during the fiscal year ended september   we recorded net restructuring charges of million as part of additional efforts to consolidate our global operations and to improve our cost structure 
impairment and restructuring expenses in the fiscal year ended september  were attributable primarily to asset impairments related to certain of our properties in arizona and california due to market decline in commercial real estate values in the fiscal year ended september  of approximately million  coupled with a reduction in force at our corporate headquarters which resulted in termination benefits and other charges of approximately million 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net increased to a net income of million in the fiscal year ended september  from a net expense of million in the fiscal year ended september  primarily as a result of increased interest rates on our cash held by foreign institutions

other income expense  net increased to income of million in the fiscal year ended september   from income of million in the fiscal year ended september  income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september  was and was for the fiscal year ended september  the decrease was primarily a result of the reorganization of international operations to further strengthen our asian operations 
the higher effective tax rate in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the establishment of valuation allowances on net operating losses related to our malaysia and united kingdom operations as a result of plans to restructure the entities 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and our ability to borrow under our various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance working capital  facility expansions  
table of contents stock repurchases and other capital expenditures 
we anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
global financial and credit markets have been volatile in recent years  and future adverse conditions of these markets could negatively affect our ability to secure funds or raise capital at a reasonable cost  if needed 
we believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth over at least the next fiscal year  without the need to repatriate earnings 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively

due to the timing of new program ramps  a substantial portion of our fourth fiscal quarter revenues were recognized late in the quarter  which resulted in a large accounts receivable balance not due until the first fiscal quarter of our net inventory balance increased to million as of september  versus million as of september  the increase was primarily the result of customer requests to stock finished goods inventory at our hub locations that are close in proximity to electronic manufacturing services ems facilities where the end product handset or tablet is assembled in preparation for our increased volume during our first fiscal quarter of our accounts payable balance increased to million as of september  from million as of september   an increase of 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily the result of the timing of inventory purchases and more favorable vendor payment terms 
purchases increased towards the end of our fourth fiscal quarter of to support increased production volumes and the corresponding payables are not due until the latter half of the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense was million for the fiscal year ended september   versus million for the comparable period of the prior year  an increase of million 
this was primarily due to an increased fixed asset base in manufacturing operations in china 
our principal investing and financing activities in our fiscal year ended september  were as follows net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended september  capital expenditures included cash purchases of million of capital equipment and other assets  which were primarily related to our manufacturing capacity expansion in china
