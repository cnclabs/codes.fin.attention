construction and operations of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to risks of delay and cost overruns 
the construction and operation of plants based on the syntroleum technologies will be subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns resulting from numerous factors 
delays in construction or operation of the plant could directly impact the capital expenditure budget or working capital budget 
increases in these costs could result in increased equity payments from parent companies 

table of contents we need to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market to be able to access adequate funding from time to time 
we could face de listing issues that would impair the liquidity of our stock and our availability to access the capital markets 
we are required to maintain standards for listing of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
one of those standards is that our common stock maintain a minimum price of at least per share 
we have in the past fallen below the minimum for periods of time  and accordingly  we can make no assurance that we will be able to remain listed on the nasdaq stock market 
we have incurred losses 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
because we do not have an operating history upon which an evaluation of our prospects can be based  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by small companies seeking to develop new and rapidly evolving technologies 
to address these risks we must  among other things  continue to attract investment capital  respond to competitive factors  continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel and commercialize our technologies 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
our anticipated expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future operating activities and not on historical financial data 
we plan to continue funding project development activities 
capital expenditures will depend on progress we make in developing various projects on which we are currently working 
increased revenues or cash flows may not result from these expenses 
if prices or margins for crude oil  natural gas  coal  vegetable oils and fats and other commodities are unfavorable  plants based on the syntroleum technologies may not be economical 
because the products from plants utilizing the syntroleum technologies are expected to compete in markets with conventional petroleum products  an increase in alternative feedstock prices relative to prices for oil  or a decrease in prices for oil relative to alternative feedstock prices  could adversely affect the operating results of these plants 
higher than anticipated costs for the catalysts and other materials used in these plants could also adversely affect operating results 
factors that could cause changes in the prices and availability of oil  natural gas  coal  biomass  fats  oils and refined products include changes in supply and demand balance of feedstocks and refined products  weather conditions  domestic and foreign government regulation  actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  political conditions in countries producing feedstocks  supply of crude oil  natural gas  coal  biomass fats  greases and oils  location of gtl plants relative to natural gas reserves and pipelines  location of ctl plants relative to coal reserves and transportation systems  location of btl plants relative to biomass reserves and transportation systems  capacities of pipelines  fluctuations in seasonal demand  crop yields  seasonality of prices for feedstocks and refined products  farmer planting decisions  output and proximity of crush facilities that convert the crops to oils  alternative uses for fats  number of animals slaughtered and rendered  price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions

power  our senior vice president and principal financial officer  and certain key personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
at december   we had full time employees 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
we have entered into employment agreements with several key employees 
we depend on strategic relationships with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers 
if we are not successful in entering into and achieving the benefits of these relationships  this could negatively impact our business 
our or our licensee s ability to identify and enter into commercial arrangements with feedstock suppliers  construction contractors  engineering service companies  site owners  manufacturing and engineering companies  and customers will depend on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants 
our success in this area will also depend on our ability to select and evaluate suitable projects  as well as to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
these relationships may take the form of joint ventures with other private parties or local government bodies  contractual arrangements with other companies  including those that supply feedstock that we will use in our business  or minority investments from third parties 
there can be no assurances that our licensees or we will be able to establish these strategic relationships  or  if established  that the relationships will be maintained 
in addition  the dynamics of our relationships with strategic participants may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to incur or undertake in order to fulfill our obligations to these partners or maintain these relationships 
if we do not successfully establish or maintain strategic relationships  our business may be negatively affected 
our operating results may be volatile due to a variety of factors and are not a meaningful indicator of future performance 
we expect to experience significant fluctuations in future annual and quarterly operating results because of the unpredictability of many factors that impact our business 
these factors include timing of any construction by us or our licensees of plants  demand for licenses or other technology transfer agreements of the syntroleum technologies and receipt and revenue recognition of license fees  volatile price of commodities used and produced  government legislation  introduction or enhancement of ft and renewable fuels technologies by us and our competitors  market acceptance of new technologies  and general economic conditions 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance 
due to all of the foregoing factors  it may be that in some future year or quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to extensive laws relating to the protection of the environment  and these laws may increase the cost of designing  constructing and operating our plants based on the syntroleum technologies or affect demand for the products of these plants 
if we violate any of the laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  we may be subject to substantial fines  criminal sanctions or third party lawsuits and may be required to install costly pollution control equipment or  in some extreme cases  curtail operations 
our ft and renewable fuels plants will generally be required to obtain permits under applicable environmental laws and various permits for industrial siting and construction 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations  as well as with any requisite environmental or construction permits  may increase the costs of designing  constructing and operating our plants 
we may also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters with respect to our previously owned real estate 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  competitive position  or financial condition 
for instance  in response to studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be 
table of contents contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere  the us congress is actively considering legislation  and more than a dozen states have already taken legal measures to reduce emission of these gases  primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
new legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our operations 
terrorist threats and us military actions could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
further acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere could occur 
these developments and similar future events may cause instability in the world s financial and insurance markets and could significantly increase political and economic instability in the geographic areas in which we may wish to operate 
these developments could also lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil  natural gas and the feedstocks for our plants and the cost and availability of insurance 
in addition  these developments could adversely affect our ability to access capital and to successfully implement projects currently under development 
united states government regulations effectively preclude us from actively engaging in business activities in certain countries 
these regulations could be expanded to cover countries where we may wish to operate in the future 
these developments could subject the operations of our company to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face 
in accordance with customary industry practices  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance  such as a leak  fire or explosion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

operations to date have consisted of activities related to the commercialization of a proprietary process the syntroleum process and previously consisted of research and development of the syntroleum process designed to convert carbonaceous material biomass  coal  natural gas and petroleum coke into synthetic liquid hydrocarbons 
synthetic hydrocarbons produced by the syntroleum process can be further processed using the syntroleum synfining process into high quality liquid fuels  such as diesel  jet fuel hrj  kerosene  naphtha  liquefied petroleum gas lpg and other chemical products 
our bio synfining technology is a second generation renewable fuels application of our synfining technology 
this technology is applied commercially via our dynamic fuels  llc joint venture with tyson foods  inc the technology processes oils  fats  fatty acids  and grease to make renewable synthetic products 
operating revenues during the periods discussed below  our revenues were primarily generated from the sale or transfer of our technology  technical services revenue from engineering and sales of products for testing purposes 
in the future  we expect to receive revenue from engineering technical services  royalties and other income from our investment in dynamic fuels  sales and licensing of our technologies and product sales or royalties for the use of our technologies in facilities in which we own an equity interest 
our revenues relating to our syntroleum technologies will consist primarily of revenues associated with technical services and sales and licensing of our technology 
we record revenue related to royalty fees based on the production of the facility 
income and loss from our investment in dynamic fuels is recorded below operating income  as income loss in equity of dynamic fuels  llc 
the income or loss is based on our proportionate equity ownership of the plant 
we may receive revenues associated with the sale of the use of our technology to certain customers with limited rights in certain geographic areas 

table of contents our future operating revenues and investments in projects will depend on the successful commercial operation of the dynamic fuels facility or other syntroleum technologies  and other competing uses for natural gas  biomass or coal 
we expect our results of operations and cash flows to be affected by changing crude oil  natural gas  oils  fats  fuel and specialty product prices and trends in environmental regulations 
operating expenses our operating expenses historically have consisted primarily of engineering  including third party engineering and general and administrative expenses  which include costs associated with general corporate overhead  compensation expense  legal and accounting expenses and expenses associated with other related administrative functions 
our current workforce consists of engineers and general and administrative employees 
we have also recognized depreciation and amortization expense related to office and computer equipment  leasehold improvements and patents 
we have incurred costs related specifically to the development and design of the bio synfining and syntroleum process 
these costs  which relate primarily to engineers and outside contract services for initial engineering  design  and development  are included in engineering costs in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have invested million of cash into our dynamic fuels bio synfining plant for our portion of start up and capital expenditures  engineering design  construction and start up of the plant 
in addition  we have made working capital loans of million to dynamic fuels primarily related to the cost of feedstocks for the plant and operating expenses  including labor  consumables and product marketing costs 
the investments and working capital loans are recorded net of our share of dynamic fuels losses on our consolidated balance sheets  under investment in and loans to dynamic fuels  llc 
commercial and licensee projects on june   we entered into definitive agreements with tyson to form dynamic fuels  to construct and operate facilities in the united states using our bio synfining technology 
dynamic fuels is organized and operated pursuant to the provisions of its limited liability company agreement between the company and tyson the llc agreement 
the llc agreement provides for management and control of dynamic fuels to be exercised jointly by representatives of the company and tyson equally with no llc member exercising control 
this entity is accounted for under the equity method and is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements  however  our share of the dynamic fuels net income or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
dynamic fuels has a different fiscal year than us 
the dynamic fuels fiscal year ends on september and we report our share of dynamic fuels results of operations on a three month lag basis 
our carrying value in dynamic fuels is reflected in investment in and loans to dynamic fuels llc in our consolidated balance sheets

each member contributed an additional million in capital contributions by december  each member made million in working capital loans to the entity by december  the non interest bearing loans do not have a stated term but will be repaid to each partner upon dynamic fuels generating sufficient operating cash flow 
we may likely need to fund future short term working capital needs of dynamic 
on october   dynamic fuels issued tax exempt bonds through the louisiana public facilities authority in the amount of million at an initial interest rate of to fund construction of the plant 
the bonds required a letter of credit in the amount of million as collateral for dynamic fuels obligations under the bonds 
tyson agreed under the terms of the warrant agreement to provide credit support for the entire million bond issue for which we issued tyson warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share 
tyson exercised the warrants in the interest rate for the bonds is a daily floating interest rate and may change significantly from this amount 
in the fourth quarter of  dynamic fuels entered into an interest rate swap which had the effect of locking in the interest rate at for a period of years with declining swap coverage 
this debt funding is in addition to the equity contributions provided by each member 
the renewable diesel produced by dynamic fuels is quality tested and meets astm d standards for diesel 
our jet fuel meets all petroleum based jet fuel specifications for astm d  commercial jet fuel  as well as hrj  military jet fuel 
the production of our fuel was eligible for the tax credit per gallon of renewable diesel and per gallon of renewable naphtha under the energy independence act and energy policy act of in and the tax credits have not been extended in our fuel also generates renewable identification number s  rin per gallon 
as of december   rin prices were per gallon and therefore worth per gallon with the multiplier 
our fuel can be sold with the rin premium included in our price of fuel 

table of contents in november  we received approval for registration of our neat renewable diesel from the environmental protection agency 
the registration of the neat renewable diesel allows combustion in regular on road engines up to percent renewable fuel  which means no blending of petroleum based diesel is required prior we had registration approval for blends up to percent renewable diesel 
this allows the entity to market its fuel directly to third party fuel end users  such as operators of on road fleet vehicles 
in  dynamic fuels entered into strategic marketing alliance  commercial off take and supply chain management agreements with mansfield oil company mansfield to efficiently distribute the plants renewable products to the commercial fleet vehicle market

the plant experienced rotating equipment issues  hydrogen supply and feedstock interruption and adulterants found in feedstock  all of which contributed to plant down time and higher than expected repairs and maintenance  catalyst replacement and other operating expenses 
feed pre treatment equipment was originally designed and installed as defined in the feedstock specifications 
certain feedstocks do not meet required specification and therefore all feedstock now goes through testing and approval and is then sourced and procured 
the quality of the feedstock has not impacted the quality of the finished product which has in all cases met or exceeded astm standards 
while these efforts have steadily decreased operating downtime as depicted above and operating expenses  improvements to the feedstock pretreatment systems are being enacted to deal with the actual feedstocks delivered
