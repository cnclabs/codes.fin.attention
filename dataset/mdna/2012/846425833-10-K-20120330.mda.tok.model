item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview we own and or operate radio stations in markets that reach approximately of the hispanic population in the united states  including puerto rico 
in addition  we broadcast via our owned and operated television stations in south florida and houston and through distribution agreements with eight other stations  including nationally on a subscriber basis  which allow us to serve television markets representing over of us hispanics 
we operate two reportable segments radio and television 
our radio stations are located in six of the eight most populous hispanic markets in the united states los angeles  new york  puerto rico  chicago  miami and san francisco 
los angeles and new york have the largest and second largest hispanic populations and are also the largest and second largest radio markets in the united states measured by advertising revenue  respectively 
we format the programming of each of our radio stations to capture a substantial share of the hispanic audience in their respective markets 
the us hispanic population is diverse  consisting of numerous identifiable ethnic groups from many different countries of origin  and each ethnic group has its own musical and cultural heritage 
since the music  culture  customs and spanish dialects vary from one radio market to another  we strive to maintain familiarity with the musical tastes and preferences of each of the various hispanic ethnic groups 
to accommodate and monetize such diversity  we customize our programming to match the local preferences of our target demographic audience in each market we serve 
for the years ended and  our radio revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local  national and network advertising  and our radio segment generated of our consolidated net revenue 
our television stations and related affiliates operate under the megatv brand 
we have created a unique television format which focuses on entertainment  current events and variety with high quality content 
our programming is formatted to capture a larger share of the us hispanic audience by focusing on our core strengths as an entertainment company  thus offering a new alternative compared to the traditional hispanic television channels 
megatv s programming is based on a strategy designed to showcase a combination of programs  ranging from televised radio branded shows to general entertainment programs  such as music  celebrity  debate  interviews and personality based shows 
as part of our strategy  we have incorporated certain of our radio on air personalities into our television programming 
in addition  we have included interactive elements into our programming to complement our internet websites 
we produce over hours of original programming per week 
for the years ended and  our television revenue was generated primarily from the sale of local advertising and paid programming and generated of our consolidated net revenues 
as part of our operating business  we also own bilingual websites  including www 
lamusica 
com  mega 
tv and various station websites that provide content related to latin music  entertainment  news and culture 
lamusica 
com and our network of station websites generate revenue primarily from advertising and sponsorship 
in addition  the majority of our station websites simultaneously stream our stations content  which has broadened the audience reach of our radio stations 
in addition  we produce live concerts and events in the united states and puerto rico 
concerts generate revenue from ticket sales  sponsorship and promotions while raising awareness of our brands in the surrounding communities 
these distinct offerings provide additional synergistic opportunities for our advertising partners to reach their targeted audiences 
business drivers and financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our consolidated financial statements and general business factors that impact these items 
net revenue description and factors our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions  which are generally of gross revenue 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold in a station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through an advertiser s agency 
local revenue includes local spot sales  integrated sales  sponsorship sales and paid programming or infomercials 
for the years ended and  local revenue comprised of our gross revenue 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sold to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
for the years ended and  national revenue comprised of our gross revenue 
within our national revenue category we also include network revenue  which generally consists of advertising airtime sold to our network sales partner and for the years ended and  comprised of our gross revenue 
our net revenue is generally determined by the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listenership viewership levels 
each station broadcasts a predetermined number of advertisements per hour with the actual number depending upon the format of a particular station and any programming strategy we are utilizing to attract an audience 
the number of advertisements we decide to broadcast hourly is intended to maximize the station s revenue without negatively impacting its audience listener viewer levels 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
our advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers which are measured by ratings agencies  primarily arbitron and nielsen  the number of stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is also affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the broadcasting industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our net revenue is typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
in addition to advertising revenue  we also generate revenue from barter sales  special events revenue  interactive revenue  syndication revenue  subscriber revenue and other revenue 
for the years ended and  these revenues combined comprised approximately of our gross revenue 
barter sales 
we use barter sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services 
however  we endeavor to minimize barter revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
special events revenue 
we generate special events revenue from ticket sales and event sponsorships by producing live concerts and events promoted by our radio and television stations 
interactive revenue 
we derive internet revenue from our websites through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet 
syndication revenue 
we receive syndication revenue from licensing various megatv content internationally 
subscriber revenue 
we receive subscriber revenue in the form of a per subscriber based fees  which is paid to us by satellite operators 
other revenue 
we receive other ancillary revenue such as rental income 
operating expenses description and factors our operating expenses consist primarily of engineering and programming expenses  selling  general and administrative and corporate expenses 
engineering and programming expenses 
engineering and programming expenses are related to the delivery and creation of our programming content on the air 
these expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in engineering and programming  transmitter related expenses  originally produced content  on air promotions  acquired programming  music license fees  broadcasting rights fees and other expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are related to the costs of selling our programming content and costs associated with operating and managing our stations 
these expenses include compensation and benefits for employees involved in selling and administrative functions  commissions  rating services  advertising  barter expenses  facilities expenses  special events expenses  professional fees  insurance  allowance of doubtful accounts and other expenses 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses are related to the operations of our corporate offices and matters 
these expenses include compensation and benefits for our corporate employees  professional fees  insurance  corporate facilities expenses and other expenses 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
also  in our pursuit to control our operating expenses  we work closely with our local station management and vendors

our radio segment net revenue increased million or  primarily due to national sales  network sales  special event revenue  offset by a decrease in local sales 
the increase in national sales occurred in our new york and puerto rico markets 
the increase in network sales and special events revenue occurred in all of our markets 
the decrease in local sales occurred in all of our markets  with the exception of our new york and puerto rico markets 
our television segment net revenue increased million or  primarily due to increases in national sales  barter sales  paid programming sales and other revenues  offset by a decrease in local spot sales and integrated sales 
engineering and programming expenses the decrease in our consolidated engineering and programming expenses of million or was due to the decreases in both our television and radio segments 
our television segment expenses decreased million or  primarily related to a decrease in broadcasting rights fees in puerto rico and new york 
our puerto rico broadcasting rights were renegotiated and thereafter terminated  which caused a reversal of broadcasting rights fees that were expensed in the prior periods 
also  we were able to terminate our programming agreement for our new york outlet  which eliminated a related broadcasting rights fee 
our radio segment expenses decreased million or  primarily related to decreases in compensation and benefits for technical and programming personnel due to headcount reductions and music license fees  offset by an increase in legal settlements 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the increase in our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses of million or was due to the increases in both our radio and television segment expenses 
our radio segment expenses increased million or  mainly due to an increase in special events expenses  ratings expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense  offset by decreases in national and local commissions  legal settlements  and compensation and benefits 
our television segment expenses increased million or  primarily due to increases in barter  facilities and office expenses 
corporate expenses the decrease in corporate expenses of million or was primarily a result of decreases in rent expense related to the subleases that we entered into in and compensation and benefits  offset by an increase in non capitalized professional fees relating to the refinancing of our senior credit facility 
impairment of assets and restructuring costs the decrease in impairment charges and restructuring costs of million is mainly related to the million impairment charge recognized on the sublease of our corporate office space and its related property and equipment for the year ended december  operating income the increase in operating income of million or was mainly due to the increase in net revenue and the decreases in impairment charges and restructuring costs  and corporate expenses 
interest expense  net the decrease in interest expense of million or was mainly due to the decreases of our senior credit facility s libor based interest rate and its outstanding balance 
change in fair value of derivative instrument the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is related to the cash flow hedge that no longer qualified for hedge accounting in the change in fair value from december  to december  impacted our earnings by million for the year ended december  income tax expense the decrease in income tax expense was primarily a result of the decrease in our fcc broadcasting licenses tax amortization 
net income the increase in net income was primarily due to the increase in operating income and decreases in interest expense  income taxes and the change in the fair value of derivative instrument 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and cash expected to be provided by operations 
we do not currently have a revolving credit facility or other working capital line of credit 
our cash flow from operations is subject to factors impacting our customers and target audience  such as overall advertising demand  shifts in population  station listenership and viewership  demographics  audience tastes and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
our ability to raise funds by increasing our indebtedness is limited by the terms of the certificate of designations governing our series b preferred stock and by the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
additionally  our certificate of designations and the indenture governing the notes place restrictions on us with respect to the sale of assets  liens  investments  dividends  debt repayments  transactions with affiliates  and consolidations and mergers  among other things 
our strategy is to primarily utilize cash flows from operations to meet our capital needs and contractual obligations 
management continually projects anticipated cash requirements and believes that cash from operating activities  together with cash on hand  should be sufficient to permit us to meet our operating obligations over the next twelve month period  including  among other things  required semi annual interest payments pursuant to the notes due april and capital expenditures  excluding the acquisitions of major fcc broadcasting licenses 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets may result in increased borrowing costs associated with our short term and long term debt 
assumptions none of which can be assured which underlie management s beliefs  include the following the demand for advertising within the broadcasting industry and economic conditions in general will not deteriorate further in any material respect  we will continue to successfully implement our business strategy  and we will not incur any material unforeseen liabilities  including but not limited to taxes  environmental liabilities  regulatory matters or legal judgments 
we evaluate strategic media acquisitions and or dispositions and strive to expand our media content through distribution and affiliations in order to achieve a significant presence with clusters of stations in the top us hispanic markets 
we engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and or dispositions and expansion of our content through media outlets from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions would be financed through funds generated from permitted debt financing  equity financing  operations  asset sales or a combination of these or other available sources 
however  there can be no assurance that financing from any of these sources  if necessary and available  can be obtained on favorable terms for future acquisitions 
refinancing of company s debt subsequent to december  on february  we closed our offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due the notes at an issue price of of the principal amount 
the notes were offered solely by means of a private placement either to qualified institutional buyers in the united states pursuant to rule a under the securities act  or to certain persons outside the united states pursuant to regulation s under the securities act  as amended 
we used the net proceeds from the offering  together with cash on hand  to repay and terminate the first lien credit facility  and to pay the transaction costs related to the offering 
interest the notes accrue interest at a rate of per year 
interest on the notes is paid semi annually on each april and october  commencing on april  after april   interest will accrue at a rate of per annum on i the original amount of the notes plus ii any additional interest as defined below payable but unpaid in any prior interest period  payable in cash on each interest payment date 
further  beginning on the interest payment date occurring on april   additional interest will be payable at a rate of per annum the additional interest on i the original principal amount of the notes plus ii any amount of additional interest payable but unpaid in any prior interest period  to be paid in cash  at our election  x on the applicable interest payment date or y on the earliest of the maturity date of the notes  any acceleration of the notes and any redemption of the notes  provided that no additional interest will be payable on any interest payment date if  for the applicable fiscal period  either a we record positive consolidated station operating income for our television segment or b our secured leverage ratio on a consolidated basis is less than to 
collateral and ranking the notes and the guarantees are secured on a first priority basis by a security interest in certain of the company s and the guarantors existing and future tangible and intangible assets other than excluded assets as defined in the indenture 
the notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the obligations of our non guarantor subsidiaries 
the notes and guarantees will be senior to all of the company s and the guarantors existing and future unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral 
the indenture permits us  under specified circumstances  to incur additional debt in the future 
the amount of such debt is limited by the covenants contained in the indenture 
the notes are senior secured obligations of the company that rank equally with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness and senior to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
subject to certain exceptions  the notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by each of our existing and future wholly owned domestic subsidiaries which excludes i our existing and future subsidiaries formed in puerto rico the puerto rican subsidiaries  ii our future subsidiaries formed under the laws of foreign jurisdictions and iii our existing and future subsidiaries  whether domestic or foreign  of the puerto rican subsidiaries or foreign subsidiaries and our other domestic subsidiaries that guarantee certain of our other debt 
the notes and guarantees are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities including trade payables of our non guarantor subsidiaries 
covenants and other matters the indenture governing the notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of the guarantors to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make other restricted payments  incur restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions from our restricted subsidiaries  engage in sale lease back transactions  enter into new lines of business  make certain payments to holders of notes that consent to amendments to the indenture governing the notes without paying such amounts to all holders of notes  create or incur certain liens  make certain investments and acquisitions  transfer or sell assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  and merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
the indenture contains certain customary representations and warranties  affirmative covenants and events of default which could  subject to certain conditions  cause the notes to become immediately due and payable  including  but not limited to  the failure to make premium or interest payments  failure by the company to accept and pay for notes tendered when and as required by the change of control and asset sale provisions of the indenture  failure to comply with certain covenants in the indenture  failure to comply with certain agreements in the indenture for a period of days following notice by the trustee or the holders of not less than in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding  failure to pay any debt within any applicable grace period after the final maturity or acceleration of such debt by the holders thereof because of a default  if the total amount of such debt unpaid or accelerated exceeds million  failure to pay final judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating million or more excluding amounts covered by insurance  which judgments are not paid  discharged or stayed  for a period of days  and certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency 
potential impact on the liquidity of our series b preferred stock our liquidity could be significantly affected on october  if the holders of shares of series b preferred stock request that we repurchase subject to the legal availability of funds all or a portion of their series b preferred stock 
we can only make such purchases out of legally available funds 
if we repurchase such series b preferred stock with cash  we would reduce cash available to make other payments 
alternatively  if we fail to discharge our repurchase obligation with respect to the series b preferred stock upon a valid request  then a voting rights triggering event will occur 
following the occurrence  and during the continuation  of a voting rights triggering event  holders of the series b preferred stock will be entitled to elect two directors to newly created positions on our board of directors  and we will be subject to more restrictive covenants  including a prohibition on our ability to incur any additional indebtedness and restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make distributions  redeem or repurchase securities  make investments  enter into transactions with affiliates or merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of our assets to any other person

net cash flows used in investing activities the increase in our net cash flows used in investing activities was a result of the increase in our capital expenditures and the acquisition of houston television station ktbu tv and its related equipment 
net cash flows used in financing activities the decrease in our net cash flows used in financing activities was a result of the absence in of the million repayment of our senior revolving credit facility in common and preferred stock as of december   we had the following series of capital stock outstanding  issued shares of series b cumulative exchangeable redeemable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of million and accumulated and unpaid dividends of million   shares of series c convertible preferred stock  par value per share  which are convertible into  shares of class a common stock and vote on an as converted basis with the common stock   shares of class a common stock  and  shares of class b common stock  which have ten votes per share

on february   we received notification from nasdaq that we had regained compliance with the market value of publicly held shares requirement for a minimum of consecutive business days as set forth in the rule 
accordingly  we have regained compliance with the rule and continue to be listed on the nasdaq global market 
debt refinancing on february  we closed our previously announced offering of million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due the notes at an issue price of of the principal amount

houston tv asset acquisition on may   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the houston purchase agreement with channel operating  lp  a texas limited partnership  usfr tower operating  lp  a texas limited partnership  humanity interested media  lp  a texas limited partnership  usfr equity drive property llc  a texas limited partnership  and us farm ranch supply company  inc  a texas corporation 
pursuant to the houston purchase agreement  the company acquired the assets  including licenses  permits and authorizations issued by the federal communications commission the fcc used in or related to the operation of television station ktbu tv digital virtual channel in conroe  texas 
on august   in connection with the closing  we paid an aggregate purchase price equal to million  consisting of i cash in the amount of million and ii a thirty six month  secured promissory note in the principal amount of million  bearing a fixed interest rate of 
the promissory note is payable in three annual installments each equal to one third of the principal amount of the note plus all accrued and unpaid interest on each of august   and it is secured by the assets purchased pursuant to the houston purchase agreement other than as precluded by law and all proceeds generated from such assets 
we allocated the total cost of the purchase price of ktbu tv based on the fair value of the assets acquired as follows million for fcc licenses  million for property and equipment  and million for other intangible assets 
reverse stock split of our class a and class b common stock on july   we filed a certificate of amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the secretary of state of the state of delaware  which effected a one for ten for reverse stock split of our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock 
the reverse stock split became effective at pm  eastern daylight time on july  the reverse stock split was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting held on june  the trading of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on a split adjusted basis began at the opening of trading on july   at which time the symbol changed to sbsad to indicate that the reverse stock split had occurred 
the symbol returned to the normal sbsa at the open of the market on august  as a result of the reverse stock split  each ten outstanding shares of pre split common stock automatically combined into one share of post split common stock 
no fractional shares were issued 
proportional adjustments were made to our outstanding stock  stock options and other equity awards and to our equity compensation plans to reflect the reverse stock split 
the consolidated financial statements for current and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the change in number of shares 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies require significant management judgments  assumptions and estimates 
accounting for indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc broadcasting licenses 
fcc broadcasting licenses are granted to stations for up to eight years under the telecommunications act of the act 
the act requires the fcc to renew a broadcast license if i it finds that the station has served the public interest  convenience and necessity  ii there have been no serious violations of either the communications act of or the fcc s rules and regulations by the licensee  and iii there have been no other serious violations  which taken together  constitute a pattern of abuse 
we intend to renew our licenses indefinitely and evidence supports our ability to do so 
historically  there has been no material challenge to our license renewals 
in addition  the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology any time in the foreseeable future 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  we do not amortize our fcc broadcasting licenses 
we test these indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs that may indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we test our fcc broadcasting licenses for impairment at the market cluster level 
we apply the guidance of fasb asc topic  unit of accounting for purposes of testing for impairment of intangible assets not subject to amortization  to certain of our fcc broadcasting licenses  if their market operations are consolidated 
our valuations principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which assumes the fcc broadcasting licenses are acquired and operated by a third party 
the valuation method used is based on the premise that the only asset that the unbuilt start up station would possess is the fcc broadcasting license 
the valuation method isolates the income attributable to a fcc broadcasting license by modeling a hypothetical greenfield build up to a normalized enterprise that  by design  lacks inherent goodwill and whose only other assets have essentially been paid for as part of the build up process 
consequently  the resulting accretion in value is solely attributed to the fcc broadcasting license 
in the discounted cash flow projections  a period of ten years was determined to be an appropriate time horizon for the analysis 
the yearly streams of cash flows are adjusted to present value using an after tax discount rate calculated for the broadcast industry as of december of each year 
a risk premium is added to this base rate  in order to reflect the uncertainty associated with a start up operation 
additionally  it is necessary to project the terminal value at the end of the ten year projection period 
the terminal value represents the hypothetical value of the licenses at the end of a ten year period 
an estimated amount of taxes are deducted from the assumed terminal value  which accordingly is discounted to net present value 
the key assumptions incorporated in the discounted cash flow model are market revenue projections  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and risk adjusted discount rates 
these assumptions vary based on the market size  type of broadcast of signal  media competition and audience share 
these assumptions primarily reflect industry norms for similar stations broadcast signals  as well as historical performance and trends of the markets 
in the preparation of the fcc broadcasting license appraisals  estimates and assumptions are made that affect the valuation of the intangible asset 
these estimates and assumptions could differ from actual results and could have a material impact on our financial statements in the future 
the key assumptions for the respective markets are further described as follows market revenue projections 
revenues are based on estimates of market revenues gathered from various third party sources 
total market revenues for were determined based on this data and market revenues were forecast over the year projection period to reflect the expected long term growth rates for the broadcast industry and each market 
over the year projection period  revenue growth rates have been projected to return to growth rates equal to the expected long term growth rate in each market 
the long term growth rates have been estimated based on historical and expected performance in each market 
in determining revenue growth rates in each market  revenue growth forecasts from various industry analysts are reviewed and analyzed 
market revenue share projections 
market revenue share projections are based upon the most recent average adjusted audience share for comparable stations operating in each market 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to the average competitor  assuming that competitor had similar technical facilities 
anticipated operating profit margins 
operating profits are defined as profit before interest  depreciation and amortization  income tax  and corporate allocation charges 
operating profits are then divided by broadcast revenues  net of agency and representative commissions  to compute the operating profit margin 
operating profit margins for each station are projected based upon industry operating margin norms  which reflect market size and station type 
in determining operating profit margins in each market  third party information is utilized 
this assumption is not specific to the performance of our stations and is predicated on the expectation that a new entrant into the market could reasonably be expected to perform at a level similar to a typical competitor 
risk adjusted discount rates 
discount rates of for radio licenses and for television licenses were used to calculate the present value of the net after tax cash flows 
the discount rates are based on an after tax rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital model as of december  the discount rates are not specific to us or to the stations  but are based upon the expected rates that would be used by a typical market participant  which include a risk premium 
these key assumptions are subject to such factors as overall advertising demand  station listenership and viewership  audience tastes  technology  fluctuation in preferred advertising media and the estimated cost of capital 
since a number of factors may influence the determination of the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses  we are unable to predict whether impairments will occur in the future 
any significant change in these factors will result in a modification of the key assumptions  which may result in an impairment 
for example  changes in the discount rates will significantly impact our impairment testing 
we note that a basis point increase in the discount rates would result in an impairment of million 
as of december   the percentage by which the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses exceeded or equaled their carrying values were as follows market market market market market market market market goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations 
asc requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level in lieu of being amortized 
we have determined that we have two reporting units under asc radio and television 
we currently only have goodwill in our radio reporting unit 
we have aggregated our operating components radio stations into a single radio reporting unit based upon the similarity of their economic characteristics  including consideration of the requirements in fasb asc  segment reporting  as required by asc our evaluation included consideration of factors such as regulatory environment  business model  gross margins  nature of services and the process for delivering these services 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
during the years ended december  and  we performed interim and or annual impairment reviews of our goodwill and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
the estimated enterprise value of our radio reporting unit exceeded its carrying value during our impairment testing 
in addition  there is currently a net accumulated deficit in our radio reporting unit and we have a net overall accumulated deficit  therefore we considered whether there were any adverse qualitative factors that would indicate that an impairment existed 
when evaluating our estimated enterprise value  we utilized an income approach which uses assumptions and estimates which among others include the aggregated expected revenues and operating margins generated by our fcc broadcasting licenses ie our stations and use of a risk adjusted discount rate 
we did not find reconciliation to our current market capitalization meaningful in the determination of our enterprise value given current factors that impact our market capitalization  including but not limited to our recent nasdaq delisting notice  limited trading volume  the impact of our television segment operating losses  and the significant voting control of our chairman and ceo 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
fasb asc  income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as a result of adopting fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  amortization of intangible assets and goodwill ceased for financial statement purposes 
as a result  we could not be assured that the reversals of the deferred tax liabilities relating to those intangible assets and goodwill would occur within our net operating loss carry forward period 
therefore  on the date of adoption  we established a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between financial statement and tax reporting purposes 
we expect to continue to reserve for any increase in our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of accounts receivable we review accounts receivable to determine which accounts are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers  age of the invoices and the overall creditworthiness of our customers 
changes in the creditworthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
revenue recognition we recognize broadcasting revenue as advertisements are aired on our stations  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an agreement exists  a fixed and determinable price  and reasonable assurance of collection 
agency commissions  where applicable  are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing revenue 
advertisers remit the gross billing amount to the agency and the agency remits gross billings  less their commission  to us when the advertisement is not placed directly by the advertiser 
payments received in advance of being earned are recorded as customer advances 
contingencies and litigations we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and  as required  have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings
