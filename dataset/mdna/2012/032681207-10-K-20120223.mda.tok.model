we incur interest expense on our deferred 
table of contents compensation obligation 
minimum future obligations on operating leases net of sublease contracts and deferred compensation as of december   are as follows in thousands year years years over total operating leases deferred compensation total critical accounting estimates policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the estimates described below are the most sensitive estimates made by management in the preparation of the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties or affect significant line items within our financial statements and potentially result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
allowance for doubtful accounts in each reporting period  we determine the reserve required to address potentially uncollectible accounts 
an evaluation of the risk associated with a client s ability to make contractually required payments is used to determine this reserve 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for collection of these receivables and include reviewing the financial stability of the client  the client s ability to pay and current market conditions 
if our evaluation of a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future charges 
revenue recognition policy we generally recognize revenue as hours are worked and costs are expended 
this includes it staffing  managed team and project based solutions services that are billed on an hourly basis  which is the majority of our revenue 
we periodically enter into fixed price engagements 
when we enter into such an engagement  revenue is recognized over the life of the contract based on time and materials input to date and the estimate of time and materials to complete the project 
this method of revenue recognition relies on accurate estimates of the cost  scope  and duration of the engagement 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  then future revenues may be negatively affected or losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
all future anticipated losses are recognized in the period they are identified 
in some cases  we provide permanent placement services for clients for a fee 
when we provide such services  revenue is recognized when the candidate commences in the position 
in certain client situations  where the nature of the engagement requires it  we utilize the services of other companies in our industry 
if these services are provided under an arrangement whereby we 
table of contents agree to retain only a fixed portion of the amount billed to the client to cover our management and administrative costs  these revenues typically are recorded on a gross versus net basis because we retain credit risk and are the primary obligor to our client 
all revenue derived from services provided by our employees or other contractors working directly for us are recorded as direct revenue 
income taxes we file a consolidated income tax return in the us federal jurisdiction 
we also file consolidated or separate company income tax returns in most states  canada federal and ontario province 
as of december   there are no federal  state  and foreign income tax audits in progress 
we are no longer subject to us federal audits for tax years before  and with few exceptions  the same for state and local audits 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
the financial accounting standards board guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor in determining that a valuation allowance on these assets continues to be appropriate 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a portion  or all  of our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
asc also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  asc provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within interest and penalties expense 
new accounting pronouncements and interpretations there have been no new accounting pronouncements issued or changes to existing pronouncements during the fiscal year ended december  that would have a material impact on our financial results
