item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis  particularly with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our proprietary procellex protein expression system 
using our procellex system  we are developing a pipeline of proprietary and biosimilar or generic versions of recombinant therapeutic proteins based on our plant cell based expression technology that target large  established pharmaceutical markets and that rely upon known biological mechanisms of action 
our initial commercial focus has been on complex therapeutic proteins  including proteins for the treatment of genetic disorders  such as gaucher disease and fabry disease 
we believe our procellex protein expression system will enable us to develop proprietary recombinant proteins that are therapeutically equivalent or superior to existing recombinant proteins currently marketed for the same indications 
because we are primarily targeting biologically equivalent versions of highly active  well tolerated and commercially successful therapeutic proteins  we believe our development process is associated with relatively less risk compared to other biopharmaceutical development processes for completely novel therapeutic proteins 
our lead product development candidate is taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease  which we are developing using our procellex protein expression system 
the fda has granted taliglucerase alfa a prescription drug user fee act pdufa date of may  we first filed an nda for taliglucerase alfa with the fda on december   and on february   the fda issued a crl indicating that the fda s review was complete but questions remain that preclude the approval of the nda in its then current form 
the main questions raised by the fda regarding the nda related to the clinical and cmc sections 
in the clinical section of the crl  the fda requested additional data from our ongoing switchover trial and our long term extension trial 
at the time the nda was submitted  full data from these trials was not available 
in the cmc section of the crl  the fda requested information regarding testing specifications and assay validation 
the fda did not request additional clinical studies in the crl 
we met with the fda in may to clarify the fda s requests  and in july we submitted our reply to the crl 
in august  the fda notified us that it had accepted for review the resubmission of the taliglucerase alfa nda  had deemed the resubmission a class  or month  response and established february  as the new pdufa date 
in december  the fda notified us that it had decided to extend the pdufa date to may  in its notification  the fda stated that its decision related to certain clinical information regarding taliglucerase alfa we had submitted in november in response to an fda request 
the requested information related mainly to the presentation of select data provided in the nda 
as this information was requested and provided within days of the february  pdufa goal date  the fda had the option to extend the pdufa goal date to provide adequate time for the fda to complete its review 
a three month extension cycle is the standard period granted 
no additional data was requested by the fda in the notification  nor were we notified of any specific deficiency in the taliglucerase alfa nda 
in the fourth quarter of  pfizer  our commercialization partner  filed  with our cooperation  an maa for taliglucerase alfa with the ema 
as part of its ongoing review of the maa  the ema delivered a list of outstanding points to be addressed by the applicant 
among the topics currently in discussion  is the orphan drug designation and exclusivity granted by the ema european commission to vpriv  which could prevent the marketing authorization of taliglucerase alfa in the european union for a year market exclusivity period commencing as of the august marketing authorization of vpriv in the european union 
as part of the maa procedure  pfizer  with our cooperation  is challenging vpriv s orphan market protection with respect to taliglucerase alfa pursuant to the eu orphan drug regulation 
the eu orphan drug regulation provides for the possibility of such a challenge  and for an exception to this exclusivity to be granted  based on a number of factors  including contribution to patient care  clinical  supply  capacity and others 
following the submission of the taliglucerase alfa maa to the ema  a good manufacturing practices  or gmp  audit of our manufacturing facility was performed and it was found compliant with ema gmp in december in january  the ema s committee for orphan medicinal products  or comp  after reviewing all relevant clinical data  recommended that the european commission grant orphan drug designation to taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease and in march  the european commission granted orphan designation to taliglucerase alfa 
in addition  marketing applications have been submitted for taliglucerase alfa with each of the israeli moh  anvisa and the australian tga 
in february  the israeli moh completed a successful gmp audit of our manufacturing facilities in carmiel  israel 
the audit was performed as part of the israeli moh s evaluation of our manufacturing process for taliglucerase alfa 
on february   we received a letter from the fda notifying us that the fda had completed its review of the establishment inspection report in connection with the fda s inspection of our facility  and that the fda had classified our facility as acceptable 
in june  anvisa completed a successful gmp audit of the facility and determined that the facility is acceptable and in december  the imb completed a successful gmp audit of our facility and issued a certificate of gmp compliance of a manufacturer for the facility 
the imb certificate is accepted by all health authorities in the european union under the european union s centralized marketing authorization procedure  and by authorities of several other countries that recognize eu certification 
in addition to the completed phase iii clinical trial we completed in september  we initiated a double blind  follow on extension study as part of the trial during the second quarter of eligible patients who successfully completed nine months of treatment in our phase iii clinical trial were offered the opportunity to participate in the extension study and continue to receive taliglucerase alfa at the same dose they received in the phase iii clinical trial for an additional months in a blinded manner 
in february  we announced data from adult patients enrolled in the trial 
according to the data  after months  patients continued to demonstrate a significant improvement in all parameters with a similar safety profile as seen in the phase iii clinical trial 
furthermore  those patients who were followed specifically for their bone parameters using quantitative chemical shift imaging qcsi mri continued to show bone marrow improvement over time 
we have also initiated a home care treatment program for patients enrolled in the extension study 
in the second quarter of we successfully completed a nine month  worldwide  multi center  open label  switch over clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of switching gaucher patients from with cerezyme to taliglucerase alfa 
the results of the switchover trial demonstrate that over the nine month treatment period  patients remained stable with regard to spleen volume  liver volume  platelet count and hemoglobin concentration  the efficacy endpoints of the switchover trial  after switching from cerezyme to taliglucerase alfa 
the safety analysis of the switchover trial demonstrated that taliglucerase alfa was well tolerated  and no drug related serious adverse events were reported 
patients in the extension trial and the switchover trial are still being treated with taliglucerase alfa 
in december  we filed a proposed pediatric investigation plan to the pediatric committee of the ema  which was approved during the first quarter of we have since initiated the pediatric study  completed enrollment of all the na ve pediatric patients required according to the study protocol and are in the final stages of pediatric patient enrollment 
on november   protalix ltd 
and pfizer entered into the pfizer agreement pursuant to which pfizer was granted an exclusive  worldwide license to develop and commercialize taliglucerase alfa 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  protalix ltd 
retained the right to commercialize taliglucerase alfa in israel 
in connection with the execution of the pfizer agreement  pfizer made an upfront payment to protalix ltd 
of million in connection with the execution of the agreement and subsequently paid protalix ltd 
an additional million upon its filing of a proposed pediatric investigation plan to the pediatric committee of the ema 
protalix ltd 
is also eligible to receive potential milestone payments totaling million for the successful achievement of other regulatory milestones 
according to the agreement  pfizer and protalix ltd 
are required to share future revenues and expenses for the development and commercialization of taliglucerase alfa on a and basis  respectively  and have agreed to a specific allocation of the responsibilities for the continued development efforts for taliglucerase alfa 
although taliglucerase alfa has not yet been approved for commercial sale  patients are being treated with taliglucerase alfa  both in the framework of our clinical trials and related studies and in compassionate use programs  special access agreements  named patient provisions and other programs designed to make sure that treatments are available to gaucher patients in light of recent shortages of approved treatments 
in july  following a request by the fda  we submitted a treatment protocol to the fda in order to address an expected shortage of the current enzyme replacement therapy approved for gaucher disease 
the treatment protocol was approved by the fda in august  and we are continuing to treat patients in the united states under this protocol 
on july   we announced that the french regulatory authority had granted an atu for taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease 
an atu is the regulatory mechanism used by the french health products and safety agency to make non approved drugs available to patients in france when a genuine public health need exists 
this atu allows patients with gaucher disease in france to receive treatment with taliglucerase alfa before marketing authorization for the product is granted in the european union 
payment for taliglucerase alfa has been secured through government allocations to hospitals 
in addition to the united states and france  taliglucerase alfa is currently being provided to gaucher disease patients under special access agreements or named patient provisions in brazil and in the rest of the world 
hundreds of patients  in the aggregate  have been treated with taliglucerase alfa 
on august   pfizer entered into a million short term supply agreement with the ministry of health of brazil pursuant to which protalix and pfizer have provided taliglucerase alfa to the ministry of health of brazil for the treatment of patients with gaucher disease 
during the first quarter of  we and pfizer supplied the remaining products deliverable under the short term supply agreement 
revenue generated from the ministry of health of brazil was recorded by pfizer  and we recorded our share of the revenue in accordance with the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement 
during the second and fourth quarters of  the ministry of health of brazil requested that pfizer consider the replacement of certain vials that might expire during as a result  pfizer recorded an allowance for sales return 
if and when such vials are replaced  revenues will be recorded upon the supply of such replaced vials  and if it is determined that there is no longer a need for the replacement of vials  the allowance will be reversed and the revenues will be recognized accordingly 
in addition  we and the ministry of health of brazil are in discussions relating to a possible long term supply agreement that contemplates  among other matters  providing certain components of our manufacturing technology to the ministry of health of brazil for implementation by it in brazil 
we are currently unable to assess whether these discussions will result in an agreement and we can make no assurance that we will be able to enter into such an agreement on favorable terms  if at all 
in any event  we do not expect to enter into a long term supply agreement with the ministry of health of brazil until we receive marketing approval of taliglucerase alfa from the fda or anvisa  if at all 
although gaucher disease is a relatively rare disease  it represents a large commercial market due to the severity of the symptoms and the chronic nature of the disease 
according to public reports by sanofi  consolidated sales of cerezyme were million or million  a growth of compared to the same period in according to genzyme  it has suffered interruptions and other limitations in its cerezyme production and release since september and  as a result  cerezyme supplies have been limited 
shire reported annual worldwide sales of vpriv of approximately million in  a growth of compared to the same period in vpriv was approved for sale in the united states in february and in the european union in august in addition to taliglucerase alfa  we are developing an innovative product pipeline using our procellex protein expression system 
our product pipeline currently includes  among other candidates prx  a therapeutic protein candidate for the treatment of fabry disease  a rare  genetic lysosomal disorder in humans  prx  a plant cell expressed pegylated recombinant acetylcholinesterase product candidate for biodefense and other indications  prx  or pr antitnf  a plant cell expressed recombinant fusion protein made from the soluble form of the human tnf receptor tnfr and an antibody portion  which is being developed as a treatment of certain immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  juvenile idiopathic arthritis  ankylosing  spondylitis  psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis  an orally administrated glucocerebrosidase enzyme for treating gaucher disease patients utilizing the oral delivery of the recombinant enzyme produced within carrot cells  and two additional undisclosed therapeutic proteins  both of which are being evaluated in animal studies 
we participated in a pre ind meeting with respect to one of the undisclosed product candidates in the first quarter of and a pre ind meeting for the second candidate is planned for later this year 
in march  we initiated a preliminary phase i clinical trial of prx which we completed in june we are currently preparing for further efficacy trials of this product candidate in larger animals 
in our preclinical studies we utilized an analogue to nerve gas 
however  we anticipate that we will use live nerve gas rather than an analogue in the proposed additional efficacy trials in animals 
in december  we held a pre ind meeting with the fda with respect to prx we completed preclinical trials in small and large animals with respect to prx  and we expect to submit an ind to the fda during the second quarter of in connection with an anticipated phase i ii clinical study of prx in fabry patients  and to initiate the trial once the ind is approved  if at all 
in december we held a pre ind meeting with respect to prx and we expect to submit an ind around year end 
we are also conducting pre clinical trials of our orally administrated glucocerebrosidase enzyme for the treatment of gaucher disease in small and large animals 
except for the rights to commercialize taliglucerase alfa worldwide other than israel which we licensed to pfizer  we hold the worldwide commercialization rights to our proprietary development candidates  and we intend to establish an internal  commercial infrastructure and targeted sales force to market taliglucerase alfa in israel and our other products  if approved  in north america  the european union and in other significant markets  including israel 
in addition we are continuously evaluating potential strategic marketing partnerships 
in september  we announced preliminary preclinical data regarding pr antitnf 
our pr antitnf product candidate has an amino acid sequence that is similar to enbrel which is one of the treatments for patients of those diseases 
we believe that we may be able to reduce the development risks and time to market for our product candidates as our product candidates are based on well understood proteins with known biological mechanisms of action 
based on our pre ind meeting with the fda held in december  we believe we may submit an ind around year end and  if approved  commence a phase i clinical trial shortly thereafter with no need for an external partner 
our business is conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  protalix ltd  which we acquired through a reverse merger transaction effective december  the merger transaction was treated as a recapitalization for accounting purposes and  as such  the results of operations discussed below are those of protalix ltd 
prior to the merger transaction  we had not conducted any operations for several years 
protalix ltd 
was originally incorporated in israel in december since its inception in december  protalix ltd 
has generated significant losses in connection with its research and development  including the clinical development of taliglucerase alfa 
since we do not generate significant revenue from any of our product candidates  we expect to continue to generate losses in connection with the continued clinical development of taliglucerase alfa and the research and development activities relating to our technology and other drug candidates 
we except that our expenditures in connection with the research and development activities will continue to represent a significant portion of our expenses for the next several years  and will require further financial resources if the activities are successful 
as a result  we believe that our operating losses may continue to be substantial over the next several years 
however  if taliglucerase alfa is launched successfully  we anticipate that we will generate revenues to offset any such losses 
we may need to obtain additional funds for the commercialization of our lead product  taliglucerase alfa  and to further develop the research and clinical development of our other programs 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate such estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
functional currency the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the us dollar 
as we have no significant source of revenues  we considered the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
most of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
revenues currently  our sole source of revenues comes from sales of taliglucerase alfa pursuant to our license agreement with pfizer 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  which is when revenue is realized or realizable and earned  there is persuasive evidence a revenue arrangement exists  delivery of goods or services has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue and milestone payments received pursuant to the pfizer agreement in accordance with guidance regarding revenue recognition and accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
pursuant to this guidance  we determine whether our arrangement with pfizer involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a combined unit of accounting or separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
if we determine that there are multiple units of accounting  the consideration from the arrangement is allocated among the separate units based on a relative fair value allocation 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue is recognized over the performance obligation period 
as the arrangement with pfizer requires our continued involvement with respect to the proposed commercialization of taliglucerase alfa  the non refundable  up front license payments we received from pfizer are deferred and recognized over the related performance period 
we estimated the performance period of years based on the date that the last relevant patent relating to taliglucerase alfa expires 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we are entitled to of the net profits or loss from sales of taliglucerase alfa by pfizer and reimbursement of our certain related expenses we incur in connection with pfizer s sales 
we retained all rights to taliglucerase alfa in israel 
we recognize our share of net profit or loss under the pfizer agreement based on reports we receive from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms of the pfizer agreement  for its subsidiaries operating outside the united states  financial information is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december we recognize revenues received from the sale of a product to pfizer upon delivery to pfizer 
the revenues represent our cost with respect to the product sold 
research and development expense we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to third party contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the advancement of product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
the following table identifies our current major research and development projects project status expected near term milestones taliglucerase alfa for the treatment of gaucher disease nda and maa ema  anvisa and the israeli moh filed pdufa date of may  from the fda  respond to ema query prx alpha gal a preclinical file ind and initiate phase i ii clinical trials acetylcholinesterase phase i clinical trial additional phase i clinical trials pr antitnf research complete pre clinical development  file ind and initiate phase i clinical trials all of our projects  other than taliglucerase alfa and our acetylcholinesterase product  are in the preclinical or research phase with relatively immaterial costs 
most of our research and development costs were incurred in connection with our phase iii clinical trial of taliglucerase alfa 
our internal resources  employees and infrastructure are not tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across all of our projects 
we currently do not record and maintain research and development costs per project 
the costs and expenses of our projects are partially funded by grants we have received from the ocs 
each grant is deducted from the related research and development expenses as the costs are incurred 
for additional information regarding the grant process  see business israeli government programs encouragement of industrial research and development law  in item of this annual report 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
at this time  due to the inherently unpredictable nature of preclinical and clinical development processes and given the early stage of our preclinical product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of the product candidates in our pipeline for potential commercialization 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our product development programs  our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
see risk factors all of our product candidates other than taliglucerase alfa and our acetylcholinesterase product are in pre clinical or research stages 
if we are unable to develop and commercialize our product candidates  our business will be adversely affected and we may not obtain the necessary us  ema or other worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize our drug candidates in a timely manner  if at all  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and preclinical product development programs for our product candidates other than taliglucerase alfa 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in generating product revenue and cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we filed a revised nda for taliglucerase alfa with the fda in the third quarter of and currently have a pdufa date of may  in addition  during  we submitted a marketing application regarding taliglucerase alfa to the israeli moh and similar applications have been submitted to each of the ema  anvisa and the australian tga 
due to the factors set forth above  we are not able to estimate with any certainty when we would recognize any net cash inflows from our projects 
see risk factors clinical trials are very expensive  time consuming and difficult to design and implement and may result in unforeseen costs which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
share based compensation the discussion below regarding share based compensation relates to share based compensation paid by protalix ltd  our wholly owned subsidiary 
in accordance with the guidance  we record the benefit of any grant to a non employee and remeasure the benefit in any future vesting period for the unvested portion of the grants  as applicable 
in addition  we use the straight line accounting method for recording the benefit of the entire grant  unlike the graded method we use to record grants made to employees 
we measure share based compensation cost for all share based awards at the fair value on the grant date and recognition of share based compensation over the service period for awards that we expect will vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined based on the number of shares granted and the price of our ordinary shares  and calculated based on the black scholes valuation model 
we recognize such value as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the accelerated method 
for purposes of determining the fair value of the options to purchase common stock granted to employees and non employees during the fiscal year ended december   including shares held by non employees that vested during such period  our management used the fair value of our common stock which was the closing sale price of our common stock on the nyse amex on the date of calculation 
the guidance requires companies to estimate the expected term of the option rather than simply using the contractual term of an option 
because of lack of data on past option exercises by employees  the expected term of the options could not be based on historic exercise patterns 
accordingly  we adopted the simplified method  according to which companies may calculate the expected term as the average between the vesting date and the expiration date  assuming the option was granted as a plain vanilla option 
in performing the valuation  we assumed an expected dividend yield in the previous years and in the next years 
we do not have a dividend policy and given the lack of profitability  dividends are not expected in the foreseeable future  if at all 
the guidance stipulates a number of factors that should be considered when estimating the expected volatility  including the implied volatility of traded options  historical volatility and the period that the shares of the company are being publicly traded 
as we did not have any traded shares or options for periods before december   the expected volatility figures used in this valuation have been calculated utilizing a blended approach by using the historical volatility of traded shares of similar companies for periods prior to december  and our own traded shares for periods subsequent to december  in addition  we examined the standard deviation of shares of similar biotechnology companies that engage in research and development  generally with no significant revenues 
we found that the volatility of our shares and the shares of comparable companies was in the range of over periods of three to six years 
the volatility used for each grant differed based on its expected term 
for the term of each grant of our options  the historical volatility was calculated based upon the overall trading history of the common stock of comparable companies 
the risk free interest rate described above has been based on the implied yield of us federal reserve zero coupon government bonds 
the remaining term of the bonds used for each valuation was equal to the expected term of the grant 
this methodology has been applied to all grants valued by us 
the guidance requires the use of a risk free interest rate based on the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues of the country in whose currency the exercise price is expressed  with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option being valued 
this requirement has been applied for all grants valued as part of this report 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues we recorded revenue of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increases in the supply of taliglucerase alfa vials to pfizer during the year ended december  revenues also include the amortization of the million upfront and milestone payments received from pfizer 
the payments were recorded as deferred revenue and the amounts will be amortized over the performance period  estimated at approximately years  at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
our share in the collaboration agreement we recorded million of loss as our share in the collaboration under the pfizer agreement during the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the million of income recorded for the year ended december  our share in the collaboration s loss for the year ended december  resulted primarily from our share of the allowance for sales return of taliglucerase alfa recorded by pfizer in connection with the short term supply agreement between pfizer and the ministry of health of brazil 
during  the ministry of health of brazil requested that pfizer consider the replacement of certain vials that might expire during as a result  pfizer recorded an allowance for sales return 
the allowance was partially offset by our share in the income generated through sale of taliglucerase alfa via the atu program in france 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we record income or loss equal to of the profit or loss realized from sales of taliglucerase alfa and related expenses incurred based on reports we receive from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the pfizer agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  financial information of pfizer s subsidiaries that operate outside the united states is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of  from million for the year ended december  the research and development expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by grants received from the ocs of approximately million  and million of reimbursements for certain expenses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to be our primary expense as we enter into a more advanced stage of preclinical and clinical trials for certain of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase  from million for the year ended december  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we become a commercial company 
financial expenses and income financial income was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  from  for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from the devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar and lower interest rates available for short term deposits during the year ended december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues we recorded revenue of million for the year ended december  compared to revenue of  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from the amortization of the million of upfront and milestone payments received from pfizer over the entire fiscal year 
such payments were amortized over one month for the year ended december  the payments were recorded as deferred revenue and the amounts will be amortized over the performance period  estimated at approximately years  at a rate of approximately million per quarter 
the amortization during the year ended december  resulted in the recognition of revenue of million  or an increase of million  from  recognized during the year ended december  in addition  we recorded revenues in the amount of approximately million in connection with products delivered to pfizer under our license agreement 
no products were sold during our share in the collaboration agreement we recorded million of income as our share in the collaboration under the pfizer agreement during the year ended december  this income resulted primarily from our share of the approximately million of revenues generated by pfizer s sale of taliglucerase alfa to the ministry of health of brazil under the short term supply agreement during pfizer s fiscal year 
no share in the collaboration was recorded for the year ended december  under the terms and conditions of the pfizer agreement  we recorded revenue equal to of the profits realized from sales of taliglucerase alfa  and related expenses incurred based on reports we received from pfizer summarizing the results of the collaborative activities under the agreement for the applicable period 
under the terms of the pfizer agreement  for its subsidiaries operating outside the united states  financial information is included based on the fiscal year ending november  while financial information for the us entity is included based on the fiscal year ending december research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase of million in development expenses related to salaries for personnel involved in research and development  and million in related subcontractors and consultants expenses  mainly in connection with our expanded access program for taliglucerase alfa 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by the recognition of grants from the ocs and pfizer s reimbursement of us  collectively equal to million 
the offsets to our research and development expenses for the year ended december  represent an increase of approximately million  or  compared to the recognition of grants from the ocs equal to million that offset our research and development expenses for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of  or approximately  from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted primarily from a  decrease in salaries expense during we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we add additional personnel and continue to comply with the reporting and other obligations applicable to public companies in the united states 
financial expenses and income financial income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or approximately  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase resulted primarily from increases in the exchange rate that resulted in income of approximately liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity as a result of our significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate significant product sales revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since our inception 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds equal to million from the sale of convertible preferred and ordinary shares of protalix ltd  and an additional million in connection with the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the sale of such shares  through december  in addition  on october   we generated gross proceeds of million in connection with an underwritten public offering of our common stock and on each of march  and february   we generated gross proceeds of million and million  respectively  in connection with underwritten public offerings of our common stock 
we believe that the funds currently available to us as are sufficient to satisfy our capital needs for at least months

these warrants were exercised in full on january  in addition to the foregoing  pfizer paid protalix ltd 
million as an upfront payment in connection with the execution of the pfizer agreement and subsequently paid to protalix ltd 
an additional million upon protalix ltd 
s meeting a certain milestone 
protalix ltd 
is also eligible to receive potential milestone payments of up to million for the successful achievement of other regulatory related milestones 
protalix ltd 
is also entitled to payments equal to of the net profits earned by pfizer on its sales of taliglucerase alfa 
in calculating net profits there are certain agreed upon limits on the amounts that may be deducted from gross sales for certain expenses and costs of goods sold 
cash flows net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  the net loss for of million was further increased by a decrease in deferred revenues of approximately million 
the net loss was partially offset by non cash charges for share based compensation of  depreciation of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities for was million and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided from financing activities during was approximately million primarily due to our underwritten public offering of common stock in the first quarter of net cash used in operations was million for the year ended december  the net loss for of million was further increased by an increase in accounts receivable of approximately million and a decrease of million in deferred revenues 
the net loss was partially offset by non cash charges for share based compensation of million  and depreciation of million 
net cash used in investing activities for was million and consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided from financing activities during was approximately  due to option exercises 
future funding requirements we expect that our operating losses may continue to be substantial over the next several years 
however  we anticipate that we will generate revenues to offset any such losses upon the successful launch of taliglucerase alfa  if at all 
we expect to incur significant research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and the advancement of our additional pipeline of product candidate into the various clinical trials 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our finance and administrative staff  add infrastructure  and incur additional costs related to our preparation for the commercial phase for our lead product candidate  taliglucerase alfa 
in addition  we are working on the expansion of our manufacturing facility that would meet approximately half of the market for our lead product candidate  which would increase our capital expenditures significantly and is estimated to cost approximately million in total 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and the net proceeds from our public underwritten offering of february will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements at least for the next months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that are subject to change and may prove to be wrong  and we may be required to use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the progress and results of our clinical trials  costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution and whether these efforts will be performed internally or through some form of collaboration with third parties  the duration and cost of discovery and preclinical development  and laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue 
we may need to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  or additional corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we currently do not have any commitments for future external funding  other than the potential regulatory related milestone payments from pfizer 
we may need to raise additional funds more quickly if one or more of our assumptions prove to be incorrect or if we choose to expand our product development efforts more rapidly than we presently anticipate 
we may also decide to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
any sale of additional equity or debt securities will likely result in dilution to our shareholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional equity or debt financing  grants or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
effects of inflation and currency fluctuations inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and clinical trial costs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or currency fluctuations could affect us by increased or decreased costs mainly for goods and services acquired outside of israel 
we do not believe currency fluctuations have had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   or off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and recently issued accounting pronouncements none 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   certain clinical contract and building contractor obligations liability for employee rights upon retirement  total      represents open purchase orders issued to certain suppliers and other vendors mainly in connection with our research and development activities that were outstanding as of december  the foregoing table does not include i annual license fees  which are currently immaterial  ii payments we may be required to make to certain of our licensors in the time periods set forth above upon the achievement of agreed upon milestones and iii royalty payments payable by us to certain of our licensors in connection with the commercial sale of our product candidates  if any 
if all of the contingencies with respect to milestone payments under our research and development agreements are met  the aggregate milestone payments payable would be approximately  and would be payable  if at all  as our projects progress over the course of a number of years 
the royalty payments payable in connection with sales of each of our product candidates  if at all  shall not exceed low  single digit percentages of net sales of the product

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency exchange risk the currency of the primary economic environment in which our operations are conducted is the dollar 
we are currently have no significant source of revenues  therefore we consider the currency of the primary economic environment to be the currency in which we expend cash 
approximately of our expenses and capital expenditures are incurred in dollars  and a significant source of our financing has been provided in us dollars 
since the dollar is the functional currency  monetary items maintained in currencies other than the dollar are remeasured using the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates and non monetary items are remeasured at historical exchange rates 
revenue and expense items are remeasured at the average rate of exchange in effect during the period in which they occur 
foreign currency translation gains or losses are recognized in the statement of operations 
approximately of our costs  including salaries  expenses and office expenses  are incurred in nis 
inflation in israel may have the effect of increasing the us dollar cost of our operations in israel 
if the us dollar declines in value in relation to the nis  it will become more expensive for us to fund our operations in israel 
a revaluation of of the nis will affect our income before tax by less than 
the exchange rate of the us dollar to the nis  based on exchange rates published by the bank of israel  was as follows year ended december  average rate for period rate at year end to date  we have not engaged in hedging transactions 
in the future  we may enter into currency hedging transactions to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the nis 
these measures  however  may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the impact of inflation in israel 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all short term  highly liquid investments  which include short term deposits with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase  that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use and are readily convertible to known amounts of cash  to be cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the interest income we receive from our investments  without increasing risk 
we invest any cash balances primarily in bank deposits and investment grade interest bearing instruments 
we are exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to interest rate risk 
our interest gains may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets
