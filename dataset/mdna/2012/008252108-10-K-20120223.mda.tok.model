our total assets under management grew to billion at december   an increase of approximately over december  the growth in our assets under management was the result of organic growth of our affiliates from net client cash flows billion  partially offset by negative investment performance billion

the alternative asset class includes private equity  multi strategy  market neutral equity and hedge products 
the geography of a particular investment product describes the general location of its investment holdings 

table of contents our strategic focus on global and emerging market equity and alternative products continues to drive the growth of our business 
during the year ended december  we experienced strong organic growth from net client cash flows in our alternative billion and equity asset classes billion 
moderately positive investment performance in the alternative and fixed income asset classes contributed to the growth in  while negative investment performance in the equity asset class resulted in a decline from as mentioned above  our global international products benefited from net client cash flows of billion and the emerging markets products benefited from net client cash flows of billion  partially offset by negative investment performance across all geographic regions 
our assets under management increased significantly during the year ended december   in large part  as a result of new affiliate investments in artemis  aston  pantheon and trilogy 
the investments in pantheon  artemis and trilogy further diversified our business by increasing our exposure to alternative  global international and emerging market product offerings 
assets under management by operating segment the following tables present a rollforward of our assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k

in  we completed investments in artemis  aston  pantheon and trilogy 
other includes assets under management attributable to affiliate product transitions and transfers of our interests in certain affiliated investment management firms  the financial effects of which are not material to our ongoing results 

table of contents as shown in the assets under management table above  client cash inflows totaled billion while client cash outflows totaled billion for the year ended december  the net flows for the year ended december  occurred across a broad range of product offerings in each of our distribution channels  with no individual cash inflow or outflow having a material impact on our revenue or expenses 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management represent an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management reflect the billing patterns of particular client accounts 
for example  assets under management for an account that bills in advance is presented in the table on the basis of beginning of period assets under management while an account that bills in arrears is reflected on the basis of end of period assets under management 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue

in  we changed our estimate of payments to be made under certain of our contingent payment arrangements and recognized a gain totaling million million of which is attributable to the controlling interest 
this gain was allocated million and million to our mutual fund and institutional channels  respectively

during  we determined that the value of a cost method investment had been reduced to zero  and recorded a million expense 
ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in supplemental liquidity measure on page results of operations revenue our revenue is generally determined by the level of our average assets under management  the portion of our assets across our products and three operating segments  which realize different fee rates  and the recognition of any performance fees 
performance fees are generally measured on absolute or relative investment performance against a benchmark 
as a result  the level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in assets under management 
our revenue increased million or in from  primarily from a increase in average assets under management  partially offset by a decline in performance fees from our consolidated affiliates

operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses in millions change change compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses the substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  the majority of which is incurred by affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
accordingly  our compensation expense is generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate s revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective operating allocations 
during  approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to our affiliate partners from their operating allocations 
the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and may vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
compensation and related expenses increased million or in  as compared to this increase was attributable to increases in aggregate affiliate expenses of million from new affiliate investments in  and also a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at extant affiliates which experienced increases in revenue  and accordingly  reported higher compensation expenses 

table of contents compensation and related expenses increased million or in the increase was attributable to increases in aggregate affiliate expenses of million from new affiliate investments  and million from the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at extant affiliates  which experienced increases in revenue  and accordingly  reported higher compensation expenses

this increase was partially offset by decreases in spending on depreciable assets in recent periods 
other operating expenses increased million or in  as compared to  principally attributable to an increase in aggregate affiliate expenses of million from new affiliate investments in  as well as an increase in costs associated with our global distribution initiatives

investment income loss from affiliate investments in partnerships relates to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates are the general partner 
in the third quarter of  we deconsolidated these partnerships 
for  the loss from affiliate investments in partnerships was million 
this loss was principally attributable to investors who are unrelated to us 
interest expense increased million or in  principally as a result of an increase in the cost of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
this increase was also attributable to a million increase in issuance costs related to the credit facility amendment that occurred in the first quarter of interest expense increased million or in  principally as a result of increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility

table of contents net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years in millions change change net income net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships net income non controlling interests net income controlling interest net income attributable to non controlling interests increased million or in this change resulted principally from the previously discussed changes in revenue 
affiliate equity issuances had the effect of increasing affiliate equity ownership  and therefore increasing net income attributable to non controlling interests 
these increases were partially offset by increases in amortization  interest expenses  tax expenses and investment losses attributable to non controlling interests  as compared to in  net income attributable to non controlling interests increased million or 
this increase was proportionately less than the increase in revenue as a result of the previously discussed increases in tax expenses 
additionally  affiliate equity repurchases had the effect of decreasing affiliate equity ownership  and therefore decreasing the income attributable to non controlling interests 
net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships relates to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates are the general partner 
in the third quarter of  we deconsolidated these partnerships 
for  the loss from affiliate investment partnerships attributable to the non controlling interests was million

net income controlling interest increased million or in as a result of the previously discussed increases in revenue and income from equity method investments  partially offset by increases in reported operating and income tax expenses and income attributable to non controlling interests 
supplemental performance measures as supplemental information  we provide non gaap performance measures that we refer to as economic net income and economic earnings per share 
we consider economic net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents our operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our investment management firms 
economic net income and economic earnings per share are used by our management and board of directors as our principal performance benchmarks  including as measures for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
these measures are provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income controlling interest and earnings per share 
economic net income and economic earnings per share are not liquidity measures and should not be used in place of any liquidity measure calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
under our economic net income definition  we add to net income controlling interest amortization including equity method amortization  deferred taxes related to intangible assets  non cash imputed interest expense principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements and affiliate equity expense 
we add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to 
table of contents generate tax deductions is added back  because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations 
we add back non cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between affiliate management partners  when these transfers have no dilutive effect to our shareholders 
economic earnings per share represents economic net income divided by the adjusted diluted average shares outstanding  which measures the potential share issuance from our senior convertible securities and junior convertible securities each further described in liquidity and capital resources using a treasury stock method 
under this method  only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of these securities in excess of par  if any  are deemed to be outstanding 
we believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation 
this method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income controlling interest to economic net income in millions  except per share data net income controlling interest intangible amortization intangible related deferred taxes imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements affiliate equity expense affiliate depreciation economic net income average shares outstanding diluted assumed issuance of senior convertible securities shares assumed issuance of junior convertible securities shares dilutive impact of senior convertible securities shares dilutive impact of junior convertible securities shares average shares outstanding adjusted diluted economic earnings per share as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements on page  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain of our investments and  as such  do not separately report these affiliates revenues or expenses including intangible amortization in our income statement 
our share of these investments amortization  million  million and million for  and  respectively  is reported in income from equity method investments 
our reported intangible amortization  million  million and million for  and  respectively  includes million  million and million  respectively  of amortization attributable to our non controlling interests  amounts not added back to net income controlling interest to measure our economic net income 
the reported intangible amortization includes a million expense associated with the revaluation of indefinite lived intangible assets at one of our affiliates 
as described in note above  we reduced the carrying value of certain of our indefinite lived intangible assets during in addition  we recorded a reduction in the united kingdom tax 
table of contents rate 
together  the tax effect of these items resulted in a million decrease in our intangible related deferred taxes 
our reported imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements  million  million and million for  and  respectively  includes  million and million of imputed interest attributable to our non controlling interests  amounts not added back to net income controlling interest to measure our economic net income 
in the first quarter of  we modified our economic net income definition to exclude non cash imputed interest and revaluation adjustments related to contingent payment arrangements from net income controlling interest  and in the fourth quarter of we further modified the definition to no longer add back affiliate depreciation to net income controlling interest 
if we had applied these definition changes to all periods presented above  economic net income would have been million and million and economic earnings per share would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources december  in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior bank debt senior convertible notes zero coupon convertible notes junior convertible trust preferred securities cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented below under supplemental liquidity measure 
we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our internal leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access additional capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider junior trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our internal leverage ratio 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting from our debt balance holding company cash 
at december   our internal leverage ratio was under the terms of our credit facility we are required to meet two financial ratio covenants 
the first of these covenants is a maximum ratio of debt to ebitda the bank leverage ratio of the calculation of our bank leverage ratio is generally consistent with our internal leverage ratio approach 
the second covenant is a minimum ebitda to cash interest expense ratio of our bank interest coverage ratio 
for purposes of calculating these ratios  share based compensation expense is added back to ebitda 
as of december   our actual bank leverage and bank interest coverage ratios were and  respectively  and we were in compliance with all terms of our credit facility 
we have million of remaining capacity under our credit facility and we could borrow the entire amount and remain in compliance with our credit agreement 

table of contents we are rated bbb by both standard poor s and fitch rating agencies 
with the exception of a modest increase in the borrowing rate under our credit facility  a downgrade of our credit rating would have no direct financial effect on any of our agreements or securities or otherwise trigger a default 
supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we have provided information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operating activities 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to ebitda in millions cash flow from operating activities interest expense  net of non cash items current tax provision income from equity method investments  net of distributions net income non controlling interests net income loss non controlling interests in partnerships changes in assets and liabilities other non cash adjustments ebitda non cash items include amortization of issuance costs and imputed interest and contingent payment arrangements million  million and million in  and  respectively 
distributions from equity method investments were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
other non cash adjustments include share based compensation expenses  tax benefits from stock options and other adjustments to reconcile net income controlling interest to net cash flow from operating activities 
in  we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities and borrowings of senior bank debt 
our principal uses of cash were to make distributions to affiliate partners and repay our senior bank debt and other liabilities 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  and for working capital purposes 
the following table summarizes the principal amount at maturity of our debt obligations and convertible securities as of december  in millions amount maturity date form of repayment senior bank debt senior convertibles notes junior convertible trust preferred securities settled in cash

table of contents senior bank debt we entered into a billion senior unsecured credit facility in november the amended credit facility  consisting of a million revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan  the principal terms of which are similar to our previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the term loan and million of the revolver have a five year maturity maturing november   the remaining million of the revolver matures january  subject to certain conditions  we may increase the revolver and the term loan by up to million and million  respectively 
the term loan borrowings were used to repay the outstanding balance under the previous revolving credit facility million and for general corporate purposes 
the amended credit facility is unsecured and contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage  as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness  liens  cash dividends  asset dispositions and fundamental corporate changes 
convertible securities at december   we have one senior convertible security outstanding senior convertible notes and two junior convertible trust preferred securities outstanding  one issued in the junior convertible trust preferred securities and a second issued in the junior convertible trust preferred securities 
the principal terms of these securities are summarized below 
convertible notes junior convertible trust preferred securities junior convertible trust preferred securities issue date august october april maturity date august october april par value in millions carrying value in millions denomination current conversion rate current conversion price stated coupon tax deduction rate the carrying value is accreted to the principal amount at maturity over an expected life of five years for the senior convertible notes and years for each of the junior convertible trust preferred securities 
these convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations  which require us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense 
the convertible notes are convertible into a defined number of shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of certain events 
upon conversion  we may elect to pay or deliver cash  shares of common stock  or some combination thereof 
the holders of the convertible notes may put these securities to us in august of    and we may call the notes for cash at any time on or after august  in the second quarter of  we called our zero coupon senior convertible notes due may  for redemption at their principal amount plus any original issue discount accrued thereon 
in lieu of redemption  all of the holders elected to convert their zero coupon senior convertible notes into shares 
table of contents of our common stock 
we issued  shares of common stock to settle these conversions  and cancelled and retired the notes 
both the and junior convertible trust preferred securities are convertible  at any time  into a defined number of shares 
upon conversion  holders will receive cash or shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof 
we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
we can call the junior convertible trust preferred securities on or after october if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
holders of the and junior trust preferred securities have no rights to put these securities to us 
derivative instruments from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income for the effective portion of the hedge 
we have entered into interest rate swap contracts to exchange a fixed rate for the variable rate on a portion of our credit facility 
these contracts expire between and under these contracts  we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of on a notional amount of million through october thereafter  through october  we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of on a remaining notional amount of million 
as of december   the unrealized loss before taxes on these contracts was million 
we also entered into treasury rate lock agreements to hedge an anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt 
treasury lock contracts with a notional value of million were settled in february for a net pre tax gain of million 
treasury lock contracts with a notional value of million were settled in october for a net pre tax loss of million 
these contracts were intended to hedge the risks associated with changes in interest rates on fixed rate debt issuance that is anticipated to occur prior to the end of the second quarter of the net loss on these contracts million is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income and will be recognized as an increase to interest expense over the life of the expected fixed rate debt issuance  or recorded within investment and other income loss in the event we determine that it is not probable we will issue the anticipated fixed rate debt 
forward equity sale agreement in july  we entered into a forward equity sale agreement with two major securities firms under which we may sell shares of our common stock with an aggregate sales price of up to million 
as of december   no forward equity sales have occurred 
affiliate equity many of our operating agreements provide us a conditional right to call and affiliate partners the conditional right to put their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
the purchase price of these conditional purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate s cash flow distributions  which is intended to represent fair value 
affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases  subject to our approval or other restrictions 
our current redemption value for these interests has been presented as redeemable non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases are difficult to predict  we expect to repurchase approximately million of affiliate 
table of contents equity during the next twelve months  and  in such event  will own the cash flow associated with any equity repurchased 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes  equity based compensation and depreciation  as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital 
the increase in cash flows from operations in as compared to  resulted principally from increases in net income of million  in the collections of investment advisory fees receivable of million  in distributions received from equity method investments of million  in amortization of intangible assets of million  and in share based compensation of million  as well as a decrease in settlements of fund shares payable of million 
these increases in cash flows were partially offset by an increase in the settlements of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
the increase in cash flows from operations in as compared to  resulted principally from increases in net income of million and in other adjustments of million  as well as a decrease in settlements of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
these increases in cash flows were partially offset by an increase in income from equity method investments of million offset by an increase in distributions received from equity method investments of million  as well as a decrease in collections of investment advisory fees receivable of million  which reduced cash flows 
investing cash flow the net cash flow used in investing activities decreased million in  as compared to this was primarily the result of the decrease in new affiliate investments in net cash flow used to make investments in affiliates was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the investment in was funded with existing cash 
our investments in and were funded as described below 
financing cash flow financing cash flows decreased  million in as compared to this was primarily a result of a decrease in net borrowings of bank debt of million  a decrease in proceeds from the settlement of forward equity sales of million  an increase in distributions to non controlling interests of million  as well as an increase in the repurchase of common stock of million 
net cash flows from financing activities increased million in as compared to  primarily a result of an increase in net borrowings of senior bank debt of million as well as an increase in proceeds from the settlement of forward equity sales of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in repurchases of affiliate equity of million 
in  we used available cash and borrowings under our credit facility to finance our investments in artemis and trilogy  and issued shares of common stock for our aston investment 
we financed our pantheon investment with available cash  borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from the partial settlement of forward equity sales 
excess tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 

table of contents under past acquisition agreements  we are contingently liable  upon achievement of specified financial targets  to make payments of up to million through in  we expect to make total payments of approximately million to settle portions of these contingent arrangements 
in addition  we expect to repurchase approximately million of interests in certain existing affiliates in our board of directors has periodically authorized share repurchase programs most recently october 
the maximum number of shares that may be repurchased under outstanding programs is approximately million 
the timing and amount of repurchases are determined at the discretion of our management 
in  we repurchased million shares for million at an average price of 
we anticipate that borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from the settlement of any forward equity sales  together with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due contractual obligations total thereafter in millions senior bank debt senior convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities leases other liabilities derivative instruments total contractual obligations contingent obligations contingent payment obligations the timing of debt payments assumes that outstanding debt is settled for cash or common stock at the applicable maturity dates 
the amounts include the cash payment of fixed interest

this table does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions or commitments to co invest in certain investment partnerships of million and million as of december   respectively as we cannot predict when such obligations will be paid 
the amount of contingent payments related to business acquisitions disclosed in the table represents our expected settlement amounts 
the maximum settlement amount through is approximately million and million in periods thereafter

such values are affected by changes in financial markets  and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
the broader financial markets are affected  in part  by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes 
table of contents in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we have fixed rates of interest on our senior convertible notes and on both issues of our junior convertible trust preferred securities 
we pay a variable rate of interest on our credit facility 
from time to time  we seek to manage our exposure to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately million 
we operate primarily in the united states  and most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
in addition  the valuations of our foreign affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which could be recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
to illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates  as of december   a change in the canadian dollar and british pound to us dollar exchange rates would result in an approximate million change to stockholders equity and a million change to income before income taxes 
during  changes in currency exchange rates decreased stockholders equity by million 
from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates under our debt financing arrangements by entering into derivative contracts as described on page we estimate that a increase in interest rates as of december  would result in a net increase in the unrealized value of our derivative contracts of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
recent accounting developments in september  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides the option of performing a qualitative assessment before proceeding with a quantitative goodwill impairment test 
following an assessment of qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  including goodwill  then a quantitative assessment is unnecessary 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we early adopted this guidance for our annual goodwill impairment testing which was performed in the third quarter of adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
this new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance does not change the items that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income 
this new guidance is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning after december  we early adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued an update to the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance 
the new guidance clarifies existing fair value measurement 
table of contents principles and expands certain disclosure requirements  particularly for measurements categorized as level the amendment is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning after december  adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the following are our critical accounting estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
these standards establish a fair value hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
we make judgments to determine the fair value of certain assets  liabilities and equity interests when allocating the purchase price of our new investments  when revaluing our contingent payment arrangements  when we issue or repurchase equity interests and when we test our intangible assets or equity and cost method investments for impairment 
in determining fair values  we make assumptions about the growth rates  profitability and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts  and consider historical and current market multiples  tax benefits  credit risk  interest rates and discount rates 
we consider the reasonableness of our assumptions by comparing our valuation conclusions to observed market transactions  and in certain instances consult with third party valuation experts 
as described further below  if we used different assumptions  the effect may be material to our financial statements 
goodwill as of december   the carrying value of goodwill was  million 
goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized  and is reported within the segments in which the business operates 
our goodwill impairment assessments are performed annually at the reporting unit level in our case  our three operating segments  or more frequently  should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment and no impairments were identified 
for purposes of our assessment  we considered various qualitative factors including market multiples for asset management businesses and determined that it was unlikely that the fair value of any of our reporting units was less than its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeds their respective carrying values  the fair values of the mutual fund  high net worth and institutional reporting units are at least greater than their respective carrying values 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the value of any of our reporting units would indicate that an impairment may exist 

table of contents indefinite lived intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts between our affiliates and their sponsored registered investment companies 
because the contracts are with the registered investment companies themselves  and not with the underlying investors  and the contracts between our affiliates and the registered investment companies are typically renewed on an annual basis  industry practice under generally accepted accounting principles is to consider the contract life to be indefinite and  as a result  not amortizable 
we perform indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the fair value of the investment advisory contract 
during the quarter ended december   we determined that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset at one of our affiliates  a growth oriented manager of us equity mutual funds  had declined below its carrying value and  accordingly  we reduced the asset to its current fair value 
this impairment  which totaled million  has been presented within amortization of intangible assets in our consolidated statements of income 
further declines in the fair value of this asset will likely result in future impairments 
for example  if assets under management underlying this asset were to decline related either to investment performance or client cash outflows  we would likely record an additional impairment of approximately million 
the fair value of each of our other indefinite lived intangible assets significantly exceeds their respective carrying value by at least  and accordingly  only a substantial decline in the fair value would indicate an impairment may exist 
definite lived intangible assets definite lived intangible assets are comprised of investment advisory contracts between our affiliates and their underlying investors  and are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we monitor the useful lives of these assets and revise them  if necessary 
we review historical and projected attrition rates and other events that may influence our projections of the future economic benefit that we will derive from these relationships 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a material impact on our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of each of our definite lived intangible assets by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we perform definite lived intangible asset impairment tests annually  or more frequently should circumstances suggest fair value has declined below the related carrying amount 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationships for impairment by comparing their carrying value to the projected undiscounted cash flows of the acquired relationships 
in the fourth quarter  we performed our impairment assessment  and no impairments were identified 
projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of each of these assets exceed their carrying value by at least 
accordingly  only a substantial decline in the undiscounted cash flows underlying these assets would indicate that an impairment may exist 
equity and cost method investments we evaluate equity and cost method investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period we consider other than temporary 
if we determine that a decline in fair value below our carrying value is other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 

table of contents for companies with quoted market prices in active markets  we use these prices to determine the fair value of our equity and cost method investments 
for companies without quoted market prices in active markets  we determine the fair values by applying a market multiple to the estimated cash flows of each investment 
our fair value multiples are supported by observed transactions and discounted cash flow analyses which reflect assumptions of current and projected levels of affiliate assets under management  fee rates and estimated expenses 
changes in estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the fair value of these investments 
in the fourth quarter  we completed our evaluation of equity and cost method investments and no impairments were identified 
the fair values of our equity method investments are at least greater than their respective carrying values 
accordingly only a substantial decline in the fair value of any of these investments for a period that is considered other than temporary would indicate that an impairment may exist 
the fair value of one of our cost method investments  a publicly traded investment firm in hong kong  had declined below our cost basis as of december  the decline was in line with the broader market decline  and because we intend to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery  no impairment was recorded 
imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements convertible debt imputed interest expense results  in part  from accreting the fair value of our convertible debt instruments at the time of issuance to their principal amounts over their expected lives 
we determine the fair value of our convertible debt using market interest rates in effect at the time of each borrowing  and our expected lives are based on an instrument s underlying contractual terms 
market interest rates are supported by observed transactions and input from valuation experts 
contingent payment arrangements imputed interest expense also results from accreting the fair value of our contingent payment obligations to our projected future payment amounts over the expected life of these arrangements  as well as any changes to our estimate of the future payments 
the fair value of our contingent payment arrangements is determined by discounting the projected future payments such estimates being dependent upon projected revenue using current market rates 
our discount rates are developed with input from valuation experts 
our expected lives are determined based on the contractual terms of the underlying arrangements 
during the quarter ended december   we changed our estimate of payments to be made under these arrangements and recognized a gain totaling million million of which is attributable to the controlling interest 
changes to our projected future payment amounts could materially affect the amount of imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements we recognize in any period 
for example  a change in our assumed discount rate or a change in our projected revenue at affiliates with these types of arrangements would result in an increase or decrease to our imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements of million and million  respectively 
redeemable non controlling interests redeemable non controlling interests represent the currently redeemable value of our affiliate partners retained equity interests 
we may pay for these affiliate equity purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration  at our election  and have presented our obligation to repurchase these interests as redeemable non controlling interests on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents we value these interests upon their transfer or repurchase by applying market multiples to an affiliate s cash flows  which is intended to represent fair value 
the use of different assumptions could change the value of these interests including the amount of compensation expense  if any  that we may report upon their transfer or repurchase 
income taxes tax regulations often require income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements 
deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns 
our overall tax position requires analysis to estimate the expected realization of tax assets and liabilities 
additionally  we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions  and  if so  the appropriate amount of the benefit 
our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and convertible securities 
most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments to be taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
we generally believe that our intangible related deferred tax liabilities are unlikely to be used to settle a cash obligation 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment 
we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment was approximately million 
during  our convertible securities generated deferred taxes of approximately million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense excluding imputed interest expense and contingent payment arrangements 
these deferred tax liabilities may be reclassified to equity if the securities convert to common stock 
we regularly assess our deferred tax assets in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
our principal deferred tax assets are state operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards 
in our assessment  we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   our valuation allowances for state net operating losses  foreign tax credit carryforwards and tax benefit from uncertain tax positions were million  million and million  respectively 
in our assessment of uncertain tax positions  we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain our tax position in an examination 
for tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon the ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting this threshold  no benefit is recognized 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans covering directors  senior management and employees 
we calculate share based compensation using the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
our share based compensation plans typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of 
table of contents continued employment 
we recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  including grants that are subject to graded vesting 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options 
in measuring expected volatility  we consider both the historical volatility of our common stock  as well as the current implied volatility from traded securities 
in determining volatility  we have placed less emphasis on periods of high volatility that are not representative of our future expectations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we grant equity interests in our affiliates to our management and affiliate partners from time to time  with vesting  forfeiture and repurchase terms established at the date of grant 
the fair value of the equity interest is determined as of the date of grant using a discounted cash flow analysis 
key valuation assumptions include projected assets under management  fee rates and discount rates 
the fair value of stock awards are determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the date of the grant 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees as they render services to their clients 
in addition to generating asset based fees  over affiliate products  representing approximately billion of assets under management  also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance 
our affiliates recognize performance fees when they are earned ie when they become billable to customers based on the contractual terms of agreements and when collection is reasonably assured 
international operations in connection with our international distribution initiatives  we have offices in sydney  australia  london  england  hong kong  and dubai  united arab emirates 
in addition  we have international operations through affiliates who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non us clients 
in the future  we may open additional offices  or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  different and in some cases  less stringent  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our affiliates that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
