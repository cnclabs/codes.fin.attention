item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including those risks and uncertainties described in item a of this report 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties 
overview on july   pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement by and among us  merger sub   and symyx  merger sub merged with and into symyx  with symyx surviving as our wholly owned subsidiary 
symyx s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements and results of operations beginning july  on may   we completed the contur acquisition whereby contur became a wholly owned subsidiary 
contur s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements and results of operations beginning may  on december   we completed the velquest acquisition whereby velquest became our wholly owned subsidiary velquest s operating results are included in our consolidated financial statements and results of operations beginning december  our business we develop and commercialize scientific informatics software products and services for industries and organizations that rely on scientific innovation to differentiate themselves in the marketplace 
historically  our products were primarily utilized by our customers research organizations 
as a result of the acquisitions  we increased the breadth and depth of our scientific product portfolio by adding a set of complementary scientific applications  content databases  technologies and domain expertise 
in addition  we have expanded our focus to include products that are utilized by our customers development and early manufacturing organizations 
in particular  the addition of the velquest suite of products gives us even greater capability downstream  extending our solutions into the quality assurance and quality control areas in large pharmaceutical companies 
collectively  our products and services are intended to optimize our customers research and development value chain  from early research through development into early manufacturing 
our software is used by our customers scientists  biologists  chemists and information technology professionals to design  execute and manage scientific experiments in silico or in the lab and to aggregate  mine  manage  analyze and interactively report on the scientific data from those experiments 
our solutions also enable the development process to scale more effectively and bring increased automation to the transition from development to early manufacturing 
the ability to integrate and access data from diverse data sources and to make that information accessible throughout the scientific value chain  enables our customers to reduce costs  enhance productivity and more efficiently provide innovative and effective products to their customers 
our customers include leaders from a variety of industries  including pharmaceutical  biotechnology  agricultural  energy  chemicals  aerospace  consumer packaged goods and industrial products  as well as various government and academic entities 
we market our software products and services worldwide  principally through our direct sales force  augmented by the use of third party distributors 
we are headquartered in san diego  california and were incorporated in delaware in description of our markets and business our customers differentiate themselves through scientific innovation 
as a result  innovation in the discovery and development of new products  compliance with applicable regulations  rapid  cost effective 
table of contents commercialization of such products and the ability to protect the intellectual property therein is crucial to our customers success 
therefore  they invest considerable resources in technologies that help identify productive new pathways for research projects  help develop new materials  increase the efficiency of discovery and development processes  and otherwise enable them to maximize the use of scientific data  information and knowledge 
our software solutions allow our customers to effectively design  plan and execute scientific experiments in a repeatable process and in compliance with regulations  leverage the vast amounts of information stored in both corporate databases and public data sources to optimize their processes and accelerate innovation  model  predict and analyze potential scientific outcomes  and access comprehensive  integrated and cross referenced databases and reference works 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are a very important part of our business 
our products have been widely adopted within the research functions of businesses in these industries  but less widely adopted by the development functions of such businesses 
in addition  these markets present challenges due to industry consolidation  the maturity of these markets  patent expirations  reduction in the level of discovery research activity  increased competition  including competition from open source software and outsourcing of research to other entities 
the other industries to which we market our products  including energy  material  agricultural  aerospace and consumer packaged goods  are earlier in the adoption curve for such scientific software products  which we view as both a challenge and an opportunity 
business strategy scientific research and development organizations face several challenges that impact their ability to comply with applicable regulations  protect their intellectual property and rapidly and cost effectively bring products to market 
among these challenges is the fact that scientific data is often found in disparate databases and that research  development and early manufacturing processes are disconnected  manually intensive  inefficient and repetitive 
our overall strategy is to extend beyond our historically strong presence in research downstream into development and early manufacturing  covering the entire research and development value chain  to move into new scientific domains  including biology  and to expand our presence outside of the pharmaceutical and biotech industries into key industries such as food and beverage  fine and specialty chemicals and aerospace 
we do this by addressing the core challenges faced by research and development organizations  offering them an open enterprise scale scientific software platform and a broad portfolio of scientific software applications leveraging our deep domain expertise in chemistry  biology and the materials sciences 
we believe the combination of our enterprise r d platform and associated set of applications  including the eln  computer aided design modeling and simulation software  data management and informatics software  content and professional services  help optimize our customers scientific value chain 
we believe that the combination of accelrys products with the products and domain expertise we acquired as a result of the acquisitions most significantly the eln and the velquest product suite enables us to provide greater value to the development and early manufacturing functions of our customers organizations 
our plan is to continue to integrate and augment our offerings in order to further enhance the value of the products we acquired and the value of our products collective portfolio to these organizations  thus enabling us to expand upon our presence in the research and development organizations of our existing customers 
the velquest acquisition extended our software portfolio into pharmaceutical development quality assurance and quality control  offering significant productivity improvements  faster cycle times  lower operational costs and reduced compliance risks for regulated life sciences organizations 
we also intend to continue to develop advanced analysis  scientific and reporting component collections in order to extend our platform s value to and use by our customers 
our strategy also includes offering professional services to further tailor our enterprise r d platform to our customers individual business needs  thereby increasing its utility and value 
because our enterprise r d 
table of contents platform is the underlying operating platform for many products in our broad portfolio  and integration with the symyx applications is a development priority  we expect the use of these products to expand as the use of our platform grows  thus further increasing our sales and value to our customers 
our enterprise r d platform is an open platform 
we partner with third party organizations and academic institutions which develop scientific software and services  and we enable and encourage these companies to develop applications that operate on our platform  further proliferating its utility and value to our customers 
we also focus on industries in markets where scientific innovation is a key differentiator  but the use of scientific software solutions has not been widely adopted 
as we develop a greater presence in these markets  we believe our ability to attract additional customers will increase 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the following primary sources software licenses  post contract customer support and maintenance services on licensed software collectively referred to as pcs  content  and professional services 
customer billings issued in connection with our revenue generating activities are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
we then recognize the revenue from these customer billings as set forth below and when all of the following criteria are met a fully executed written contract or purchase order has been obtained from the customer ie  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contractual price of the product or services has been defined and agreed to in the contract or purchase order ie  price is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product or service has occurred and no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance of the delivered product or service exist  and collection of the purchase price from the customer is considered probable 
software licenses 
we license software on a term and perpetual basis 
when sold perpetually  our standard perpetual software licensing arrangements generally include twelve months of bundled pcs  while our standard 
table of contents term based software licensing arrangements typically include pcs for the full duration of the term license 
because we do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of these undelivered elements  we recognize as revenue the entire fee for such perpetual and term based licenses ratably over the term of the bundled pcs 
renewal of pcs under perpetual software licenses 
our pcs includes the right to receive unspecified upgrades or enhancements and technical support 
fees from customer renewals of pcs related to previously purchased perpetual licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the pcs 
content 
content is licensed on a term basis and provides customers with access to the licensed content over the term of the agreement 
revenue from these licensing arrangements is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  which is typically twelve months 
professional services 
we provide certain services to our customers  including non complex product training  installation  implementation and other professional services which are non essential to the operation of the software 
we also perform professional services for our customers designed to enhance the value of our software products by creating extensions to functionality to address a client s specific business needs 
when sold separately  revenue from these services is generally recognized as the services are delivered under the proportional performance when we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
for service arrangements that include provisions that create significant uncertainties eg customer acceptance or service deliverables wherein the level of effort to complete the services cannot be reasonably estimated  the associated revenue is recognized using the completed performance method 
multi element arrangements 
for multi element arrangements which include software licenses  pcs and non complex training  installation and implementation services which are non essential to the operation of the software  the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the pcs or delivery of the services  whichever is longer 
for multi element arrangements which also include services that are essential to the operation of the software  the fee for such arrangements is generally deferred until the services essential to the operation of the software have been performed  at which point the entire fee for such arrangements is recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining term of the pcs or the delivery of the non essential services  whichever is longer 
royalty income we recognize royalty income based on reported sales by third party licensees of products containing the applicable licensed materials and intellectual property 
royalty revenue is recognized as these payments become due 
non refundable royalties  for which there are no further performance obligations  are recognized when due under the terms of the applicable agreements 
valuation of goodwill our goodwill resulted from acquisitions in fiscal years through in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit 

table of contents our goodwill is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned exceeds its estimated fair value 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december  and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
based on the guidance provided by asc topic and asc topic  segment reporting  management has determined that our company consists of one reporting unit given the similarities of economic characteristics between our operations and the common nature of our products  services and customers 
because we have only one reporting unit  and because we are publicly traded  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization as we believe this represents the best evidence of fair value 
our conclusion that goodwill was not impaired was based on a comparison of our net assets as of december  to our market capitalization 
because we determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on our market capitalization  our future reviews of goodwill for impairment may be impacted by changes in the price of our common stock 
for example  a significant decline in the price of our common stock may cause the fair value of our goodwill to fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of goodwill for impairment a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
valuation of indefinite lived intangible asset in connection with our acquisition of scitegic in september  we acquired the scitegic trade name which was determined to be indefinitely lived 
in accordance with asc topic  we review our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment at least annually in our fiscal fourth quarter and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate a potential reduction in the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
examples of such events or circumstances include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  a significant decline in our stock price  a significant decline in our projected revenue or cash flows  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of an asset 
our indefinite lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
we completed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test as of december  and concluded that our indefinite lived intangible asset was not impaired 
we estimated the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis which considers the estimated future customer orders for our scientific informatics platform and the associated direct and incremental selling  marketing  and product development costs 
key assumptions included in the discounted cash flow analysis include projections of future customer order growth for our scientific informatics platform and developing an appropriate discount rate 
we cannot assure you that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows will materialize as estimated 
for example  if our projections of future customer order growth do not materialize  the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset may fall below its carrying value 
therefore  we cannot assure you that when we complete our future reviews of our indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment that a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc topic and asc topic  property  plant and equipment  we review long lived assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the market price of an asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset or asset group is being used  the loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant negative industry or economic trends or the presence of other indicators that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is not recoverable 

table of contents a long lived asset is considered to be impaired if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s undiscounted future cash flows  we utilize our internal forecast of our future operating results and cash flows  our strategic business plans and anticipated future economic and market conditions 
there are inherent estimates and assumptions underlying this information and management s judgment is required in the application of this information to the determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
no assurance can be given that the underlying estimates and assumptions utilized in our determination of an asset s undiscounted future cash flows will materialize as anticipated 
valuation of marketable securities we invest in various types of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  commercial paper  certificates of deposits  corporate and municipal debt 
in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements  we classify our investments as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable  and have active markets  for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
these might include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates  volatilities  prepayment speeds  credit risks  etc 
or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by market data by correlation or other means 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
as noted in note fair value measurements in part ii  item of this form k  a majority of our security holdings have been classified as level we assess our marketable securities for impairment under the guidance provided by asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
accordingly  we review the fair value of our marketable securities at least quarterly to determine if declines in the fair value of individual securities are other than temporary in nature 
if we believe the decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary  we write down the carrying value of the security to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge against income 
to determine if a decline in the fair value of an investment is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  among others  the period of time and extent to which the estimated fair value has been less than cost  overall market conditions  the historical and projected future financial condition of the issuer of the security and our ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery of the market value 
valuation of share based awards we account for our share based awards in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc topic 
we estimate the fair value of our share based stock awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain input variables  as follows expected volatility 
volatility is a measure of the amount the stock price will fluctuate during the expected life of an award 
we determine volatility based on our historical stock price volatility over the most recent period equivalent to the expected life of the award  giving consideration to company specific events impacting our historical volatility that are unlikely to occur in the future  as well as anticipated future events that may impact volatility 
we also consider the historical stock price volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies 
risk free interest rate 
our assumption of the risk free interest rate is based on the interest rates on us constant rate treasury securities with contractual terms approximately equal to the expected life of the award 
expected dividend yield 
because we have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  we assume a dividend yield of zero 

table of contents expected award life 
we determine the expected life of an award by considering various relevant factors  including the vesting period and contractual term of the award  our employees historical exercise patterns and length of service and employee characteristics 
we also consider the expected award lives of comparable publicly traded companies 
for stock purchase plan purchase rights  the expected life is equal to the current offering period under the stock purchase plan 
under asc topic  we are also required to estimate at grant the likelihood that the award will ultimately vest the pre vesting forfeiture rate  and to revise the estimate  if necessary  in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate differs 
we determine the pre vesting forfeiture rate of an award based on our historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience  giving consideration to company specific events impacting historical pre vesting award forfeiture experience that are unlikely to occur in the future as well as anticipated future events that may impact forfeiture rates 
our determination of the input variables used in the black scholes option pricing model as well as the pre vesting forfeiture rate is based on various underlying estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective and are affected by our stock price  among other factors 
changes in these underlying estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value of our share based awards and  therefore  the amount of share based compensation expense to be recognized in our results of operations 
long term investments we determine the accounting method used to account for investments in equity securities of other business entities in which we do not have a controlling interest primarily based on our ownership of each such business entity and whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the strategic  operating  investing and financing activities of each such business entity 
we monitor these investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  market conditions and operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc topic 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
the provision for income taxes is based on our estimates for taxable income of the various legal entities and jurisdictions in which we operate 
as such  income tax expense may vary from the customary relationship between income tax expense and pre tax income 
we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to reduce them to the amount expected to be realized 
we assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in making this assessment we are required to consider all available positive and negative evidence to determine whether  based on such evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred assets will be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
we do not recognize current and future tax benefits until it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained 
in general  any realization of our net deferred tax assets will reduce our effective rate in future periods 
however  the realization of deferred tax assets that are related to net nols that were generated by tax deductions resulting from the exercise of non qualified stock options will be a direct increase to stockholders equity 
we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained

our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue to generate software sales  the purchase of additional capital equipment and acquisitions of other businesses or technologies 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is forward looking information  and actual results could vary

changes to the fair market value of the liability are recognized in stockholders equity 
the liability for our guarantee of the lease obligation was million at both december  and off balance sheet arrangements and related party transactions as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

 comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu requires retrospective application  and both asu s are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  and the interim reporting periods within those years 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
instead  asu requires entities to report all non owner changes in stockholders equity in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
in addition  items of other comprehensive income that are reclassified to profit or loss are required to be presented separately on the face of the financial statements 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  or when an item must be reclassified to net income 
asu defers the changes in asu that pertain to how  when and where reclassification adjustments are presented 
we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu  which gives an entity the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform step of the annual goodwill impairment test 
an entity is required to perform step only if it concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment on none  some or all of its reporting units or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step of the impairment test 
this new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this accounting pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu  which amends asc topic and clarifies the requirement to test for impairment of goodwill 
asc topic requires that goodwill be tested for impairment if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
under asu  when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative  an entity must assume that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and calculate the amount of that impairment 
the modifications to asc topic resulting from the issuance of asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the interim periods within those years 
early adoption is not permitted 
this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

on february   our board of directors authorized the company to commit up to an additional million for a total repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock during fiscal pursuant to a program to be executed in accordance with a rule b trading plan 
we have not made any purchases under these authorizations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to our us operations  we have operations in europe and the asia pacific region 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly fluctuations in the pound sterling  euro and yen exchange rates 
many of our reporting entities conduct a portion of their business in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
these transactions give rise to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency 
the value of these receivables and payables is subject to changes in exchange rates because the receivables and payables may become worth more or less than they were worth at the time we entered into the transaction due to changes in currency exchange rates 
the majority of our software license agreements are denominated in us dollars 
both realized and unrealized gains or losses on the value of these receivables and payables  along with the settlement of certain intercompany transactions  are included in the determination of net income 
to mitigate our risk from foreign currency fluctuations  we launched a foreign currency hedging program in december whereby we will periodically enter into currency derivative contracts  principally forward contracts with short term maturities 
our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur from the underlying exposure with gains and losses on the derivative contracts used to offset them 
we do not hold or purchase any foreign currency contracts for trading or speculative purposes and we do not designate these forward contracts or swaps as hedging instruments 
accordingly  we report the fair value of these contracts in the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of foreign currency contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
none of our investments are held for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to the relatively short maturities of these investments 
while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our results of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be an other than temporary impairment
