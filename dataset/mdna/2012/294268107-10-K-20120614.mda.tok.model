our proprietary software and associated business process services allow us to better support and retain our customers in our technology sales and finance businesses 
we have developed and acquired these products and services to distinguish us from our competition by providing a comprehensive offering to customers 
our primary target customers are middle market and larger companies in the united states of america with annual revenues between million and billion 
we have over  active customers 
we believe there are more than  target customers in this market 
industry background in the current marketplace  we believe demand for it equipment  services  and financing is driven by the following industry trends in calendar year  it spending in most categories increased  driven by the general economic recovery  the deferral of it spending by many customers in prior years  customer interest in cloud computing  and the positive return on investment that can be gained by virtualization technologies 
in  many industry analysts are forecasting an increase in overall it spending in the us as compared to  and the first calendar quarter produced solid results in many sectors of the industry 
we believe that customers are continuing to focus on cost savings initiatives by utilizing technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing  and we continue to provide these and other advanced technology solutions to meet these needs 
we believe customers are focused on protecting their information assets including intellectual property  data and business process 
a well designed security program should protect the organization with perimeter security  access control  authentication  data integrity and confidentiality 
we offer security services that enhance our customers security programs  from their data centers to end user mobile devices  and all points between 
these comprehensive and complex solutions may include consulting  hardware  software  and implementation  and ongoing maintenance and monitoring 
we have continued to focus our resources in these areas to meet expected customer demand 
we believe that customers are seeking to reduce the number of vendors they do business with for the purpose of improving internal efficiencies  enhancing accountability and improving supplier management practices  and reducing costs 
we have continued to enhance our relationships with premier manufacturers and gained the engineering and sales certifications required to provide the most desired technologies for our customers 
in addition  we have continued to enhance our automated business processes and utilizing our proprietary software as our onesource family of solutions  to make transacting business with us more efficient and cost effective for our customers 
we introduced onesource it as a portal for customers purchasing from us  and onesource it  to improve internal business process efficiencies for customers ordering from us and multiple suppliers 
onesource it is positioned to help our customers and prospects reduce the number of suppliers they purchase from  eliminate multiple and unique ordering processes  provide a consolidated view of it purchases  consolidate invoice and payable processing and reduce the complexities of it spending through multiple suppliers 

table of contents we believe that customers prefer bundled offerings  which may include it products  services and leasing  due to decreased liquidity in the global financial markets  as customers seek to preserve cash balances and working capital 
we have continuously evolved our advanced professional service and software capabilities 
we believe that we are distinctively positioned to take advantage of this shift in the purchasing process as evidenced by continued development of our various integrated solutions  which we began developing in earlier than many other direct marketers and we continue to believe that our bundled solution set is a leader in the marketplace because of its breadth and depth of offerings 
we believe that we will continue to benefit from industry changes as a cost effective provider of a full range of it products and services with the added competitive advantage of our proprietary software 
in addition  our ability to provide financing for capital assets to our customers and our lifecycle management solutions provides an additional benefit and differentiator in the marketplace 
while purchasing decisions will continue to be influenced by product selection and availability  price  and convenience  we believe that our comprehensive set of solutions is a differentiator that businesses will look for in order to reduce the total cost of ownership 
competition the market for it sales and professional services is intensely competitive  subject to economic conditions and rapid change  and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we expect to continue to compete in all areas of our business against local  regional  national and international firms  including manufacturers  other direct marketers  national and regional resellers  and regional  national  and international services providers 
in addition  many computer manufacturers may sell or lease directly to our customers  and our continued ability to compete effectively may be affected by the policies of such manufacturers 
we believe that we offer enhanced solution capability  broader product selection and availability  competitive prices  and greater purchasing convenience as compared to many of our competitors 
in addition  our dedicated account executives offer the necessary support functions eg  software  purchases on credit terms  leasing  and efficient return processes that internet only sellers do not usually provide 
we believe that we are one of the few companies in the united states that offers  as a principal  a comprehensive solution  which can include eprocurement  leasing  advanced technology solutions  it fulfillment  and end to end asset management services 
the leasing market is intensely competitive and subject to changing economic conditions and market activities of industry participants 
we expect to continue to compete against local  regional  national and international firms  including banks  specialty finance companies  vendors captive finance companies  and third party leasing companies 
banks and other large financial services companies sell directly to business customers  particularly larger enterprise customers  and may provide other financial or ancillary services that we do not provide 
vendor captive leasing companies may utilize internal transfer pricing to effectively lower lease rates and or bundle equipment sales and leasing to provide highly competitive packages to customers 
third party leasing companies may have deep customer and contractual relationships that are difficult to displace 
however  these competitors typically do not provide the breadth of product  service  and software offerings that we provide to our customers 
we believe that we offer an enhanced leasing solution to our customers  which provides a business process services approach that can automate the leasing process and reduce our customers cost of doing business 
the solution incorporates value added services at every step in the leasing process  including front end processing  such as eprocurement  order aggregation  order automation  vendor performance measurement  ordering  reconciliation  and payment  lifecycle and asset ownership services  including asset management  change management  and property tax filing  and end of life services such as equipment audit  removal  and disposal 
in addition  we are able to bundle equipment sales and technically advanced professional services to provide a turnkey leasing solution 
this allows us to differentiate ourselves with a customer service strategy that spans the continuum from fast delivery of competitively priced products to end of life disposal services  and a selling approach that permits us to grow with customers and solidify those relationships 
we expanded our product and service offerings under our comprehensive set of solutions that combines our it sales and professional services  leasing and financing services  asset management software and services  procurement software  and electronic catalog content management software and services 

table of contents in the software market  there are a number of companies developing and marketing business to business electronic commerce solutions similar to ours and competitors are migrating their offerings to a software as a service saas platform 
some of these competitors and potential competitors include enterprise resource planning erp system vendors and other major software vendors that are expected to sell their procurement and asset management products along with their application suites 
these erp vendors have a significant installed customer base and have the opportunity to offer additional products to those customers as additional components of their respective application suites 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and have to overcome potential customers reluctance to move away from legacy systems and processes 
we believe that the principal competitive factors for success are scalability  functionality  ease of use  ease of implementation  ability to integrate with legacy systems  experience in business to business supply chain management  and knowledge of a business asset management needs 
we believe we can compete favorably with our competitors in these areas within our framework that consists of our onesource family of software   eplus leasing  strategic sourcing  and business process outsourcing 
in all of our markets  some of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities  offer more attractive terms to customers  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 
for a discussion of risks associated with the actions of our competitors  see item a  risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
strategy our goal is to become a leading provider of bundled product and service solutions in the it supply chain 
the key elements of our strategy include the following grow profitably by selling additional products and services to our existing customer base  expand geographically and build a national footprint to grow our customer base through  hiring and strategic acquisitions  expanding our advanced technology solutions offerings  and improve operational efficiencies and effectiveness 
grow profitably by selling additional products and services to our existing customer base we seek to become the primary provider of it solutions for our customers by delivering the best customer service  pricing  availability  and professional services in the most efficient manner 
we continue to focus on improving our sales efficiency by providing on going training  targeted incentive compensation  and implementing better automation processes to reduce costs and improve productivity 
our account executives are trained on our broad solutions capabilities and to sell in a consultative manner that increases the likelihood of cross selling our solutions 
we believe that our bundled offerings are an important differentiating factor from our competitors 
we created a software portal called onesource  which is an integrated order entry platform to enhance product sales  increase incremental sales  and reduce costs by eliminating touch points for order automation 
we further extended the onesource brand by creating two differentiated solutions onesource it  for purchasing from eplus technology catalog  and onesource it  for purchasing from eplus and other technology vendors  both onesource and onesource it are complementary applications offered to our customers 
we continue to offer onesource procurement  onesource it  and onesource supplier portal  a full suite of eprocurement  catalog content management  and spend analysis applications on an saas or enterprise basis 
we also have a telesales group of experienced telesales professionals  engineers and inside sales representatives to support our outside sales reps 
we further expanded the group  which included a second location and a new manager 
this group is focused on marketing to existing and new customers primarily within the geographic reach of our existing service areas  supporting vendor demand generation campaigns  and marketing to specific vertical markets  such as healthcare 

table of contents expand geographically and build a national footprint we intend to increase our direct sales and targeted marketing efforts in each of our geographic and vertical industry areas 
we actively seek to acquire new account relationships through a new outbound telesales effort  face to face field sales  electronic commerce especially onesource  leveraging our partnerships with manufacturers  and targeted direct marketing to increase awareness of our solutions 
in particular  we are developing several industry market focuses  including healthcare  legal  and financial services 
in addition to marketing to private sector  we are expanding our public sector customers which include state  local and municipal governments  and educational institutions 
grow our customer base 
through hiring and strategic acquisitions based on our prior experience  capital structure  and business systems and processes  we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of hiring experienced sales people and engineers  and make strategic acquisitions that broaden our customer base  expand our geographic reach  scale our existing operating structure  and or enhance our product and service offerings 
part of our growth strategy is to hire aggressively  and evaluate and consider strategic acquisition opportunities if and when they become available 
during the fiscal year  our sales force grew from to  our engineering staff grew from to  and we acquired ncc networks  inc ncc  vanticore  llc vanticore  and pacific blue micro  inc pbm as part of our expansion strategy 
expanding advanced technology solutions offerings we have focused on gaining engineering certifications and advanced professional services expertise in advanced technologies of strategic manufacturers  such as cisco systems  ibm  hewlett packard  netapp  vmware  emc  and oracle 
we are especially focused on virtual desktop infrastructure  data center virtualization  unified communications  collaboration  cloud computing  networking  security  visual communications  audio visual  and storage technologies that are currently in high demand 
in fiscal year  we developed ecloud  a comprehensive approach for customers who desire to utilize cloud computing 
we believe our ability to deliver advanced professional services provides benefits in two ways 
first  we gain recognition and mindshare of our strategic vendor partners and become the go to partner in selected regional and national markets 
this significantly increases direct and referral sales opportunities for our products and services  and allows us to achieve optimal pricing levels 
second  within our existing and potential customer base  our advanced professional services are a key differentiator against competitors who cannot provide services or advanced services for these key technologies 
improve operational efficiencies we continue to invest in our internal technology infrastructure and software platforms to optimize our operations  and to engage in process re engineering efforts to become more streamlined and cost effective 
research and development in the early s we acquired our own proprietary software products and hired employees to help us maintain and continually develop our software 
we expense software development costs as they are incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
at such time  development costs are capitalized until the product is made available for release to customers 
for the year ended march   thousand was capitalized net of disposal and thousand was amortized 
for the year ended march   thousand was capitalized and thousand was amortized 
for the year ended march   no such costs were capitalized and thousand was amortized 
we have other expenses relating to enhancements  upgrades  and other improvements which are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred 
we have also outsourced certain programming tasks to an offshore software development company to supplement our internal development support  and quality assurance resources 
in addition  we continue to enhance our software and some or all of these costs may be considered period costs 
to successfully implement our business strategy and service the disparate requirements of our customers and potential customers  we have a flexible delivery model  which includes hosted or subscription  traditional enterprise licenses  or saas  or a services model  where our personnel may utilize our software to provide one or more solutions to our customers 

table of contents we expect that competitive factors will create a continuing need for us to improve and add to our technology platform 
the addition of new products and services will also require that we continue to improve the technology underlying our applications 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in systems  personnel  and development to maintain a competitive advantage in this market 
sales and marketing we focus our sales and marketing efforts on lead generation activities and converting our existing customer base to our bundled solution set 
the target market for our customer base is primarily middle and large market companies with annual revenues between million and billion 
we believe there are over  potential customers in our target market and we currently have over  customers 
we undertake direct marketing campaigns to target certain markets in conjunction with our primary manufacturer partners  who may provide financial reimbursement  outsourced services  and personnel to assist us in these efforts 
our sales representatives are compensated by a combination of salary and commission  with commission becoming the primary component of compensation as the sales representatives gain experience 
to date  we acquired a majority of our customers through the efforts of our direct sales force 
we market to different areas within a customer s organization depending on the products or services 
we also market to customers through our telesales group  consisting of experienced telesales sales professionals and engineers 
this group is focused on marketing to existing and new customers primarily within the geographic reach of our existing service areas 
as of march   our sales force was organized regionally in office locations throughout the united states 
see item  properties of this form k for additional office location information 
as of march   our sales organization included sales  marketing  and sales support personnel 
intellectual property rights our success depends in part upon proprietary business methodologies and technologies that we have licensed and modified 
we own certain software programs or have entered into software licensing agreements to provide services to our customers 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secret protection  confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect intellectual property rights 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
for example  in the united states we have three patents generally directed to electronic sourcing systems and processes  six catalog management patents  three image transmission management patents  a patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network  a hosted asset information management patent  and an ecatalog supplier portal patent  among others 
we have counterparts of the electronic sourcing system patents in nine european forums and japan  a counterpart of the image transmission management patents in six additional forums  and a counterpart for the collaborative editing of electronic documents patent has been issued in canada 
the three electronic sourcing system patents are currently under reexamination at the us patent and trademark office uspto 
we cannot provide an assessment of the likely outcome of the proceedings and it may take years before they reach their ultimate resolution 
we cannot provide assurance that any patents  as issued  will prevent the development of competitive products or that our patents will not be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through the administrative process or litigation 
otherwise  the earliest of the three electronic sourcing system patents is scheduled to expire in  the three image transmission patents are scheduled to expire in  the earliest of the catalog management patents is scheduled to expire in  and the patent for collaborative editing of electronic documents over a network is scheduled to expire in  provided that all maintenance fees are paid in accordance with uspto regulations 
we also have the following registered service trademarks eplus  directsight  procure  manage  finance  eplus leasing  docpak  viewmark  digital paper  onesource  content  eecm  and eplus enterprise cost management 
in addition  we have over registered copyrights and additional common law trademarks and copyrights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and can be expensive  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy could be expected to be a persistent problem 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our proprietary intellectual property 

table of contents sales and financing activities we are in the business of selling and providing advanced technology solutions for a wide array of information technology products and software  leasing  and financing of it and other capital assets and services  and we are a software publisher for procurement  content management  document management and asset management software 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from such activities 
it sales and professional services 
we are an authorized reseller of  or have the right to resell products and services from  over manufacturers

our most important manufacturer relationships include cisco systems  hewlett packard  netapp  vmware  emc  and oracle

leasing and financing 
our leasing and financing transactions generally fall into two categories direct financing and operating leases 
direct financing transfers substantially all of the benefits and risks of equipment ownership to the customer 
operating leases consist of all other leases that do not meet the criteria to be direct financing leases 
our lease transactions include leases and installment sales or conditional sales contracts with corporations  non profit entities and municipal and federal government contractors 
a large part of our lease transactions are net leases with a specified non cancelable lease term and a fixed amount of rent 
these non cancelable leases have a provision which requires the lessee to make all lease payments without offset or counterclaim 
government leases are typically subject to annual funding by the governmental entity 
a net lease requires the lessee to make the full lease payment and pay any other expenses associated with the use of equipment  such as maintenance  casualty and liability insurance  sales or use taxes and personal property taxes 
we primarily lease computers  associated accessories and software  communication related equipment  and medical equipment  and we may also lease industrial machinery and equipment  office furniture and general office equipment  transportation equipment  and other general business equipment 
in anticipation of the expiration of the term of a lease  we initiate the remarketing process for the related equipment 
our goal is to maximize revenues from the remarketing effort by either re leasing or selling the equipment to the initial lessee  renting the equipment to the initial lessee on a month to month basis  or selling the equipment to an equipment broker or leasing the equipment to a different customer 
the remarketing process is intended to enable us to recover or exceed the original estimated residual value of the leased equipment 
any amounts received over the estimated residual value less any commission expenses become profit to us and can significantly impact the degree of profitability of a lease transaction 
we aggressively manage the remarketing process of our leases to maximize the profit margin on our leased equipment portfolio 
to date  we have realized a premium over our estimated residual value 

table of contents financing and bank relationships 
we have a number of bank and finance company relationships that provide working capital for our businesses and long term financing for our lease financing businesses 
our finance department is responsible for maintaining and developing relationships with a diversified pool of commercial banks and finance companies with varying terms and conditions 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
risk management and process controls 
it is our goal to minimize the financial risks of our assets 
to accomplish this goal  we use and maintain conservative underwriting policies and disciplined credit approval processes 
we also have internal control processes  including credit management  contract origination and management  cash management  servicing  collections  remarketing and accounting 
we may utilize non recourse financing which is secured by a lease s underlying equipment and the specific lease and not our general assets for our leasing transactions and we try to obtain lender commitments before acquiring the related assets 
when desirable  we manage our risk in assets by selling leased assets  including the residual portion of leases  to third parties rather than owning them 
for certain transactions  we may act as an intermediary and obtain commitments for these asset sales before we consummate the lease 
we also use agency purchase orders to procure equipment for lease to our customers as an agent  not a principal  and otherwise take measures to minimize our inventory 
when our technology business segment is the supplier under a lease  we maintain the risk from procurement 
additionally  we use fixed rate funding and issue proposals that adjust for material adverse interest rate movements as well as material adverse changes to the financial condition of the customer 
we have an executive management review process and other internal controls in place to evaluate the transactions potential risk 
our lease and sale contracts are reviewed by senior management for pricing  structure  documentation  and credit quality 
due  in part  to our strategy of focusing on certain equipment categories  we have product knowledge  historical re marketing information and experience with many of the items that we lease  sell  and service 
we rely on our experience or outside opinions to set and adjust our sale prices  lease rate factors  and residual values 
default and loss experience 
during the fiscal year ended march   we added million to our reserves for credit losses  incurred actual credit losses of thousand and had recoveries of thousand 
a significant portion of the increase in reserves for credit losses of approximately million was related to a specific customer  which recently filed for bankruptcy 
during the fiscal year ended march   we added thousand to our reserves for credit losses  incurred actual credit losses of thousand and had recoveries of thousand 
during the fiscal year ended march   we added thousand to our reserves for credit losses  incurred actual credit losses of thousand and had recoveries of thousand 
employees as of march   we employed full time and part time employees 
these employees operated through office locations  including our principal executive offices and regional sales offices

in addition  many governments who are our customers are experiencing financial difficulties which are causing budget shortfalls and resulting in decreased demand for our products and services 
as a result  our revenues could decrease and reserves for our credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable may increase 
we depend on having creditworthy customers to avoid an adverse impact to our operating results and financial condition our financing and technology sales business segments require sufficient amounts of debt and equity capital to fund our equipment purchases 
if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases  or if we experience a material increase in our credit losses  we may find it difficult to continue to obtain the required capital for our business  and our operating results and financial condition may be harmed 
in addition to the impact on our ability to attract capital  a material increase in our delinquency and default experience would itself have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our lenders have reduced their demand for non investment grade leases which has made financing lower credit customers more difficult or impossible in some cases 
we recorded reserves for credit losses of million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the reserve for credit losses for the year ended march  included a specific reserve of million due to a specific customer  which recently filed for bankruptcy 
if we do not reserve adequately for our credit losses our earnings may be adversely affected our reserve for credit losses reflects management s judgment of the loss potential of our accounts and notes receivable and minimum lease payments associated with our investments in direct financing and sales type leases 
we base our judgment on the nature and financial characteristics of our obligors  general economic conditions and our bad debt experience 
we also consider delinquency rates and the value of the collateral underlying the finance receivables 
we cannot be certain that our reserve for credit losses will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in our portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries or markets 
if our reserves for credit losses are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
costs to protect our intellectual property may affect our earnings the legal and associated costs to protect our intellectual property may significantly increase our expenses and have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may deem it necessary to protect our intellectual property rights and significant expenses could be incurred with no certainty of the results of these potential actions 
costs relative to lawsuits are usually expensed in the periods incurred and there is no certainty in recouping any of the amounts expended regardless of the outcome of any action 
we incurred million  million  and million in legal and other fees during the years ended march    and  respectively  related to protecting our intellectual property 

table of contents we may experience a reduction in the incentive programs offered to us by our vendors that would affect our earnings we receive payments and credits from vendors  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs  shared marketing expense programs and early pay discounts 
these programs are usually of finite terms and may not be renewed or may be changed in a way that has an adverse effect on us 
vendor funding is used to offset  among other things  inventory costs  costs of goods sold  marketing costs and other operating expenses 
certain of these funds are based on our volume of net sales or purchases  growth rate of net sales or purchases and marketing programs 
if we do not grow our net sales over prior periods or if we are not in compliance with the terms of these programs  there could be a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered or paid to us by vendors 
we may not continue to receive such incentives or may not be able to collect outstanding amounts relating to these incentives in a timely manner  or at all 
any sizeable reduction in  the discontinuance of  a significant delay in receiving or the inability to collect such incentives  particularly related to incentive programs with our largest partners  cisco systems and hewlett packard  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to react timely to any fundamental changes in the programs of vendors  including the elimination of funding for some of the activities for which we have been compensated in the past  such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended march   vendor incentives earned decreased slightly as a percent of our consolidated sales of products and services 
more specifically  the change in the amounts of vendor incentives earned during the year ended march  resulted in a decrease in gross margin for products and services 
the change in the amount of vendor incentives earned during the years ended march  and resulted in an increase to our gross margins for products and services of and  respectively 
if we lost several of our larger customers our earnings may be affected our contracts for the provision of products are generally non exclusive agreements that are terminable by either party upon days notice 
in addition  our agreements with these larger customers do not provide for minimum purchase commitments 
either the loss of several of our large customers  or the failure of such customers to pay their accounts receivable on a timely basis  or a material reduction in the amount of purchases made by such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
changes in accounting rules may adversely affect our future financial results we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these accounting principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission  the american institute of certified public accountants and various other bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
future periodic assessments required by current or new accounting standards may result in noncash changes and or changes in presentation or disclosure 
a change from current accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we may be required to take additional impairment charges for goodwill or intangible assets related to acquisitions we have acquired certain portions of our business and certain assets through acquisitions 
further  as part of our long term business strategy  we may continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies or assets 
in connection with prior acquisitions  we have accounted for the portion of the purchase price paid in excess of the book value of the assets acquired as goodwill or intangible assets  and we may be required to account for similar premiums paid on future acquisitions in the same manner 
under the applicable accounting rules  goodwill is not amortized and is carried on our books at its original value  subject to annual review and evaluation for impairment  whereas intangible assets are amortized over the life of the asset 
changes in the business itself  the economic environment including business valuation levels and trends  or the legislative or regulatory environment may trigger a review and evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment outside of the normal review periods 
these changes may adversely affect either the fair value of the business or the fair value of our individual reporting units and we may be required to take an impairment charge 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate further  this could increase the likelihood that we will need to record additional impairment charges to the extent the carrying value of our goodwill exceeds the fair value of our overall business 
such impairment charges could materially adversely affect our net earnings during the period in which the charge is taken 
as of march   we had goodwill of million 
we may not be able to realize our entire investment in the equipment we lease the realization of equipment values residual values during the life and predominantly at the end of the term of a lease is an important element in our leasing business 
at the inception of each lease  we record a residual value for the leased equipment based on our estimate of the future value of the equipment at the expected disposition date 
a decrease in the market value of leased equipment at a rate greater than the rate we projected  whether due to rapid technological or economic obsolescence  unusual wear and tear on the equipment  excessive use of the equipment  or other factors  would adversely affect the recoverability of the estimated residual values of such equipment 
further  certain equipment residual values are dependent on the manufacturer s or vendor s warranties  reputation and other factors  including market liquidity 
in addition  we may not realize the full market value of equipment if we are required to sell it to meet liquidity needs or for other reasons outside of the ordinary course of business 
consequently  there can be no assurance that we will realize our estimated residual values for equipment 
the degree of residual realization risk varies by transaction type 
direct financing leases bear less risk because contractual payments cover approximately or more of the equipment s lease cost at inception 
operating leases have a higher degree of risk because a smaller percentage of the equipment s value is covered by contractual cash flows at lease inception 

table of contents we depend on third party companies to perform some of our obligations to our customers  which if not performed could cause significant disruption to our business 
we rely on arrangements with third parties to perform certain services for our customers  which  if not performed in accordance with the terms of the agreement  could result in significant disruptions or costs to our organization  including damaging customer relationships  if these third parties do not meet their obligations or maintain adequate service levels 
we rely on arrangements with independent shipping companies  such as fedex and united parcel service  for the delivery of our products from vendors to our customers 
the failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products  or the unavailability of their shipping services  even temporarily  could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may also be adversely affected by an increase in freight surcharges due to rising fuel costs and added security 
the soundness of financial institutions with which we have relationships could adversely affect us we have relationships with many financial institutions  including the lender under our credit facility  and  from time to time  we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry 
some of our balances that we maintain with various financial institutions may exceed the  maximum insured deposit amount by the fdic 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  financial institutions or the financial services industry generally  could result in losses or defaults by these institutions 
in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties  we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to access credit facilities or complete transactions as intended  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
changes in the it industry and or rapid changes in product standards may result in substantial inventory obsolescence and may reduce demand for the it hardware  software and services we sell our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors  including the condition of the it industry  shifts in demand for  or availability of  it hardware  software  peripherals and services  and industry introductions of new products  upgrades or methods of distribution 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products  product enhancements and new distribution methods or channels  each of which can decrease demand for current products or render them obsolete 
sales of products and services can be dependent on demand for specific product categories  and any change in demand for or supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and or cause us to record write downs of obsolete inventory  if we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes 
we rely on inventory and accounts receivable financing arrangements for working capital and our accounts payable processing the loss of the technology sales business segment s credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we rely on this facility and its components for daily working capital and the operational function of our accounts payable process 
our credit agreement contains various net worth and debt covenants that must be met each quarter 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet those debt covenants and failure to do so may limit availability of  or cause us to lose  such financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available to us in the future on acceptable terms 
we may not adequately protect ourselves through our contract vehicles or insurance policies our contracts may not protect us against the risks inherent in our business including  but not limited to  warranties  limitations of liability  human resources and subcontractors  patent and product liability  and financing activities 
despite the non recourse nature of the loans financing our activities  non recourse lenders have  in the past  brought suit when the underlying transaction turns out poorly for the lenders 
we have vigorously defended such cases in the past and will do so in the future  however  investors should be aware that we are subject to such suits and the cost of defending such suits due to the nature of our business 

table of contents we rely on a small number of key vendors and do not have long term supply or guaranteed price agreements with our vendors a substantial portion of our sales of product and services are dependent on a small number of key manufacturers including cisco systems and hewlett packard 
products manufactured by cisco systems represented approximately  and of our total sales of products and services for the years ended march   and  respectively 
products manufactured by hewlett packard represented approximately  and of our total sales of products and services for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the loss of a key vendor or manufacturer or changes in its policies could adversely impact our ability to sell 
in addition  violation of a contract that results in either the termination of our ability to sell the product or a decrease in our certification with the manufacturer could adversely impact our earnings 
our officers and directors own a significant amount of our common stock and may be able to exert a significant influence over corporate matters our officers and directors beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock as of march  as a result  these stockholders acting together will be able to exert considerable influence over the election of our directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring stockholder approval 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of eplus and consequently could affect the market price of our common stock 
we may not be able to hire and retain personnel that we need to succeed to increase market awareness and sales of our offerings  we may need to expand our sales operations and marketing efforts in the future 
our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort and significant technical support 
for example  our sales and engineering candidates must have highly technical hardware and software knowledge in order to suggest a customized solution for our customers business processes 
competition for qualified sales  marketing and technical personnel fluctuates depending on market conditions and we might not be able to hire or retain sufficient numbers of such personnel to maintain and grow our business 
increasingly  our competitors are requiring their employees to agree to non compete and non solicitation agreements as part of the employment  and this could make it more difficult for us to hire those persons 
we face substantial competition from larger companies as well as our manufacturers and financial partners in our reseller business  manufacturers may choose to market their products directly to end users  rather than through resellers such as our company  and this could adversely affect our future sales 
in addition  a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our vendors and financial partners could increase our need for and cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many competitors compete principally on the basis of price and may have lower costs or accept lower selling prices than us and  therefore  current gross margins may not be maintainable 
in addition  we do not have guaranteed commitments from our customers and  therefore  our sales volume may be volatile 
in our leasing business  we face competition from many sources including much larger companies with greater financial resources 
our competition may even come from some of the manufacturers of the products we lease or financial partners who choose to market directly to customers through their captive leasing organization 
our competition may lower lease rates in order to increase market share 
we face risks of claims from third parties for intellectual property infringement that could harm our business we may be subject to claims that our products and services or products that we resell infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
the manufacturer of certain products or services may not provide us with indemnification for infringement 
however  our customers may seek indemnification from us 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against infringement claims 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we and our customers may be required to obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain such licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could significantly increase our expenses and or adversely affect our ability to offer one or more of our services 

table of contents we may be liable for misappropriation of our customers personal information the security systems used in our product and service offerings may be circumvented or sabotaged by third parties  which could result in the disclosure of sensitive information or private personal information  unauthorized procurement  or cause other business interruptions that could damage our reputation and disrupt our business 
if third parties or our employees are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers personal information or credit card information  or such information for which our customers may be responsible and for which we agree to be responsible in connection with service contracts we may enter  or if we give third parties or our employees improper access to any such personal information or credit card information  we could be subject to liability 
this liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information  identity theft or other similar fraud related claims 
this liability could also include claims for other misuses of personal information  including for unauthorized marketing purposes 
other liability could include claims alleging misrepresentation or our privacy and data security practices 
any such liability for misappropriation of this information could decrease our profitability 
in addition  the federal trade commission and state agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding whether they misused or inadequately secured personal information regarding consumers 
we could incur additional expenses if new laws or regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if government agencies investigate our privacy practices 
we seek to rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure online transmission of confidential information such as customer credit card numbers 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect sensitive customer transaction data 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
our security measures are designed to protect against security breaches  but our failure to prevent such security breaches could cause us to incur significant expense to investigate and respond to a security breach and correct any problems caused by any breach  subject us to liability  damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand name 
we may not have designed our information technology systems to support our business without failure we are dependent upon the reliability of our information  telecommunication and other systems  which are used for sales  distribution  marketing  purchasing  inventory management  order processing  customer service and general accounting functions 
interruption of our information systems  internet or telecommunications systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
if we fail to consummate and integrate acquisitions  our profitability may be adversely affected our ability to successfully integrate the operations we acquire  to reduce costs  or leverage these operations to generate revenue and earnings growth  could significantly impact future revenue and earnings 
integrating acquired operations is a significant challenge and there is no assurance that we will be able to manage the integrations successfully 
failure to successfully integrate acquired operations may adversely affect our cost structure thereby reducing our gross margins and return on investment 
in addition  we may acquire entities with unknown liabilities  fraud  cultural or business environment issues or that may not have adequate internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our business may suffer the success of our business strategy depends  in part  upon proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights 
to date  we have relied primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws and contractual provisions with our subcontractors and employees to protect our proprietary technology 
it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
some of our agreements with our customers and technology licensors contain residual clauses regarding confidentiality and the rights of third parties to obtain the source code for our products 
these provisions may limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in the future that could seriously harm our business and operating results 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights may not be adequate 

table of contents changes in taxes and other regulatory legislation may require us to change our policies or structure we operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
when new legislation is enacted with minimal advance notice  or when new interpretations or applications of existing laws are made  we may need to implement changes in our policies or structure 
we plan our structure and operations based upon existing laws and anticipated future changes in the law 
we are susceptible to unanticipated changes in legislation  especially relating to income and other taxes  as well as other laws related to trade and business activities 
such changes in legislation may have a significant adverse effect on our business 
our electronic commerce related products and services subject us to challenges and risks in a rapidly evolving market as a provider of a comprehensive set of solutions  which involves the bundling of direct it sales  professional services and financing with our proprietary software  we expect to encounter some of the challenges  risks  difficulties and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies providing new and or bundled solutions in rapidly evolving markets 
some of these challenges include our ability to increase the total number of users of our services  adapt to meet changes in our markets and competitive developments or continue to update our technology to enhance the features and functionality of our suite of products 
our business strategy may not be successful or successfully address these and other challenges  risks and uncertainties 
in the software market  there are a number of companies developing and marketing business to business electronic commerce solutions similar to ours  and competitors are migrating their offerings to a saas platform 
some of these competitors and potential competitors include erp system vendors and other major software vendors that are expected to sell their procurement and asset management products along with their application suites 
these erp vendors have a significant installed customer base and have the opportunity to offer additional products to those customers as additional components of their respective application suites 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  and competitive pressures faced by us may harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and have to overcome potential customers reluctance to move away from legacy systems and processes 
in all of our markets  some of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies  and customer requirements 
many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional marketing and advertising activities  offer more attractive terms to customers  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do 
we expect to incur significant sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses in connection with the development of this area of our business  however  we may not be successful in achieving revenue growth 
these expected expenses may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results as a whole 
if our products contain defects  our business could suffer products as complex as those used to provide our electronic commerce solutions often contain unknown and undetected errors or performance problems 
many serious defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction of new products or enhancements to existing products 
undetected errors or performance problems may not be discovered in the future and errors considered by us to be minor may be considered serious by our customers 
in addition  our customers may experience a loss in connectivity by our hosted solution as a result of a power loss at our data center  internet interruption or defects in our software 
this could result in lost revenues  delays in customer acceptance or unforeseen liabilities that would be detrimental to our reputation and to our business 
if we publish inaccurate catalog content data  our business could suffer any defects or errors in catalog content data could harm our customers or deter businesses from participating in our offering  damage our business reputation  harm our ability to attract new customers  and potentially expose us to legal liability 
in addition  from time to time vendors who provide us electronic catalog data could submit to us inaccurate pricing or other catalog data 
even though such inaccuracies are not caused by our work and are not within our control  such inaccuracies could deter current and potential customers from using our products or result in inaccurate pricing to our customers

filed a suit in the united states district court for the western district of michigan against the huntington national bank huntington 
the complaint alleges counts of aiding and abetting fraud  aiding and abetting conversion  and statutory conversion  relating to our former customer  cyberco holdings  inc  which was perpetrating a scam 
summary judgment was granted in favor of huntington with regard to our claims in the suit 
a final judgment was entered in february  and in march we filed an appeal with the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit 
while we believe we have a basis for these claims to recover certain of our losses related to cyberco  we cannot predict whether we will be successful in our claims for damages  whether any award ultimately received will exceed the costs incurred to pursue this matter  or how long it will take to bring this matter to resolution 
we are the plaintiff in a lawsuit in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia in which a jury unanimously found that lawson software  inc lawson infringed certain eplus patents 
the jury verdict  which was reached on january   also found that all of eplus patent claims tried in court were not invalid 
on may   the court issued a permanent injunction  ordering lawson and its successors to immediately stop selling and servicing products relating to its electronic procurement systems that infringe our patents  cease providing any ongoing or future maintenance  training or installation of its infringing products  and refrain from publishing any literature or information that encourages the use or sale of its infringing products 
lawson s request to stay the injunction was denied  however  lawson has appealed the trial court s ruling 
we have filed a motion seeking a finding that lawson is in contempt of the injunction 
we currently do not have a hearing date for our motion 
we also have appealed the trial court s evidentiary ruling which precluded us from seeking monetary damages 
oral argument on the appeal of the trial courts ruling was held on june  court calendars are inherently unpredictable and we cannot predict when the court will issue a ruling 
we may become party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business including preference payment claims asserted in customer bankruptcy proceedings  claims of alleged infringement of patents  trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights  claims of alleged non compliance with contract provisions  employment related claims  claims by competitors  vendors or customers  and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations 
although we do not expect that the outcome in any of these matters  individually or collectively  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  litigation is inherently unpredictable

for a more detailed description of the restatement  see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements 
our sales of products and services are affected by our customers investment in technology products and related services  which in turn  are driven by the general economic conditions and our customers business outlook 
although sales increased during the year ended march   there is no guarantee that the trend will continue 
our gross margins are driven by the mix of products and service sales and incentives received from manufacturers and or distributors 
during recent years  we gradually reduced our non recourse and recourse notes payable balance as we invested our cash in the lease portfolio to increase our overall returns 
however  our investment in leases and leased equipment has decreased due to lower lease originations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations financial review of eplus is intended to help investors understand our company and our operations 
the financial review is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
our financial results as of and for the years ended march  and have been revised 
all information and disclosures contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been revised to reflect the restatement described in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements 
summary of restatement during the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended march   we reassessed the presentation of sales of third party software assurance  maintenance and services and  after giving further consideration with respect to gross vs 
net reporting  and concluded that these transactions should be presented on a net basis in accordance with codification topic  revenue recognition  subtopic principal agent considerations 
we determined that we should be considered an agent in the transaction because a third party is responsible for the day to day provision of services under the contract 
this change in the determination of that status results in different accounting treatment of the revenue resulting from the sale of such third party software assurance  maintenance and services  requiring the revenue to be reported net of the associated cost of the underlying contract with the third party service provider 
under net sales recognition  the cost paid to the third party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales of products and services  resulting in net sales being equal to the gross profit on the transaction 
this change in accounting policy and restatement affects our revenues and offsetting costs and expenses for the identified periods but does not affect our previously reported earnings before provision for income tax  net earnings  net earnings per common share or consolidated statement of cash flows 
additionally  we identified an unrelated error in connection with financing revenue reported prior to that had an immaterial effect on our previously reported consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
the restatement did not impact our underlying agreements with  or obligations to  our customers and third party service providers  nor the amount that we invoice to our customers 
executive overview business description eplus and its consolidated subsidiaries provide leading it products and services  flexible leasing solutions  and enterprise supply management to enable our customers to optimize their it infrastructure and supply chain processes 
our revenues are composed of sales of product and services  financing revenues and fee and other income 
our operations are conducted through two business segments our technology sales business segment and our financing business segment 
financial summary in recent years  the united states experienced substantial uncertainty in the economic environment  including financial market disruption 
in addition  the debt crisis in certain countries in the european union has contributed to continuing economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states 
a reoccurrence of the economic downturn could cause our current and potential customers to once again delay or reduce technology purchases and result in longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
credit risk associated with our customers and vendors may also be adversely impacted 
in addition  although we do not anticipate the need for additional capital in the near term due to our current financial position  a reoccurrence of the economic downturn may adversely affect our access to additional capital 
however  in calendar year  it spending in most categories increased  driven by the general economic recovery  the deferral of it spending by many customers in prior years  customer interest in cloud computing  the positive return on investment that can be gained by virtualization technologies  and the reduction of manufacturer shipment delays in the supply chain 
in  many industry analysts are forecasting an increase in overall it spending in the us as compared to  and the first calendar quarter produced solid results in many sectors of the industry 
we believe that customers are continuing to focus on cost savings initiatives by utilizing technologies such as virtualization and cloud computing  and we continue to provide these and other advanced technology solutions to meet these needs 

table of contents during the year ended march   total revenue increased to million and total costs and expenses increased to million 
net earnings decreased to million  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross margin for product and services was during the year ended march  compared to during the year ended march  our gross margin on sales of product and services was affected by our customers investment in technology equipment  the mix and volume of products sold and changes in incentives provided to us by manufacturers 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million or to million at march  compared to march   while short term investments increased to million 
we continued our share repurchase program during the fiscal year ended march   and repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of million 
in addition  we acquired three companies during the fiscal year ended march  with a net purchase price of million 
our cash and short term investments on hand  funds generated from operations  amounts available under our credit facility and the possible monetization of our investment portfolio provide sufficient liquidity for our business 
business segment overview technology sales business segment the technology sales business segment sells it equipment and software and related services primarily to corporate customers  state and local governments  and higher education institutions on a nationwide basis  with geographic concentrations relating to our physical locations 
the technology sales business segment also provides internet based business to business supply chain management solutions for information technology products 
our technology sales business segment derives revenue from the sales of new equipment and service engagements 
these revenues are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations under sales of product and services and fee and other income 
customers who purchase it equipment and services from us may have customer master agreements  or cmas  with our company  which stipulate the terms and conditions of the relationship 
some cmas contain pricing arrangements  and most contain mutual termination for convenience clauses 
our other customers place orders using purchase orders without a cma in place or with other documentation customary for the business 
often  our work with governments is based on public bids and our written bid responses 
a substantial portion of our sales of product and services are from sales of cisco systems and hewlett packard products  which represent approximately and of sales of product and services  respectively  for the year ended march  as compared to and of total revenues  respectively  for the year ended march   and and of total revenues  respectively  for the year ended march  included in the sales of product and services are revenues derived from performing advanced professional services that may be bundled with sales of equipment which are integral to the successful delivery of such equipment 
our service engagements are generally governed by statements of work  and are primarily fixed price with allowance for changes  however  some service agreements are based on time and materials 
we endeavor to minimize the cost of sales in our technology sales business segment through vendor consideration programs provided by manufacturers and other incentives provided by distributors 
the programs we qualify for are generally set by our reseller authorization level with the manufacturer 
the authorization level we achieve and maintain governs the types of products we can resell as well as such items as pricing received  funds provided for the marketing of these products and other special promotions 
these authorization levels are achieved by us through sales volume  certifications held by sales executives or engineers and or contractual commitments by us 
the authorization levels are costly to maintain and these programs continually change and  therefore  there is no guarantee of future reductions of costs provided by these vendor consideration programs 
we currently maintain the following authorization levels with our primary manufacturers

our revenues also include earnings from certain transactions that are infrequent  and there is no guarantee that future transactions of the same nature  size or profitability will occur 
our ability to consummate such transactions  and the timing thereof  may depend largely upon factors outside the direct control of management 
the earnings from these types of transactions in a particular period may not be indicative of the earnings that can be expected in future periods 
these revenues are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations under fee and other income 
financing business segment the financing business segment offers financing solutions to corporations and governmental entities nationwide and in certain other countries 
the financing business unit derives revenue from leasing primarily it and medical equipment and the disposition of that equipment at the end of the lease 
these revenues are reflected under financing revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
financing revenues consist of amortization of unearned income on notes receivables  direct financing and sales type leases  rentals due under operating leases  net gains or losses on the sales of financing receivables  and sales of equipment at the end of a lease  as well as other post term financing revenue 
the types of revenue and costs recognized by us are determined by each lease s individual classification 
each lease is classified as either a direct financing lease  sales type lease  or operating lease  as appropriate 
for direct financing and sales type leases  we record the net investment in leases  which consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments  initial direct costs direct financing leases only  and unguaranteed residual value gross investment less the unearned income 
the unearned income is amortized over the life of the lease using the interest method 
under sales type leases  the difference between the present value of minimum lease payments and the cost of the leased property plus initial direct costs net margins is recorded as profit at the inception of the lease 
for operating leases  rental amounts are accrued on a straight line basis over the lease term and are recognized as financing revenue 
we account for the transfer of financing receivables that meet the definition of financial assets and certain criteria outlined in transfers and servicing in the codification  including surrender of control  as sales for financial reporting purposes 
the net gain on the transfer of these financial assets is recognized in financing revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents our financing business segment sells the equipment underlying a lease to the lessee or a third party other than the lessee 
these sales occur at the end of the lease term and revenues from the sales of such equipment are recognized at the date of sale 
the net gain or loss on these transactions is presented within financing revenue in our consolidated statement of operations 
we also recognize revenue from events that occur after the initial sale of a financial asset and remarketing fees from our off lease equipment 
these revenues are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations under fee and other income 
fluctuations in revenues our results of operations are susceptible to fluctuations for a number of reasons  including  without limitation  customer demand for our products and services  supplier costs  changes in vendor incentive programs  interest rate fluctuations  general economic conditions  and differences between estimated residual values and actual amounts realized related to the equipment we lease 
operating results could also fluctuate as a result of a sale prior to the expiration of the lease term to the lessee or to a third party or from other post term events 
we expect to continue to expand by opening new sales locations and hiring additional staff for specific targeted market areas in the near future whenever we can find both experienced personnel and desirable geographic areas 
these investments may reduce our results from operations in the short term 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to amend revenue recognition in the codification 
this update removes the fair value criterion from the separation criteria for multiple deliverables arrangements 
it also replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under fair value measurements and disclosures in the codification  provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
we adopted this update on april  refer to note  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  for additional information 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  testing goodwill for impairment  which amends topic  intangibles goodwill and other in the codification 
while this amendment does not change the calculation of goodwill impairment  it simplifies how companies test goodwill for impairment 
under this amendment  a company would be permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in intangibles goodwill and other in the codification 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we adopted this update on october  refer to note  goodwill  for additional information 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued an update to amend comprehensive income in the codification 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
companies are required to present components of net income  total net income  components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update is effective for us beginning on april  
table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  or different assumptions were made  it is possible that alternative accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in a change in financial results 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  residual values  vendor consideration  lease classification  goodwill and intangibles  reserves for credit losses and income taxes specifically relating to uncertain tax positions 
we base estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and therefore  these estimates may require adjustment 
we consider the following accounting policies important in understanding the potential impact of our judgments and estimates on our operating results and financial condition 
for additional information on these and other accounting policies  see note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenues are derived from the following sources sales of products  third party software  third party software assurance  maintenance and services  sales of our services  financing revenues  and sales of our software  
for all these revenue sources  we determine whether we are the principal or agent in accordance with codification topic  revenue recognition  subtopic principal agent considerations 
our revenue recognition policies vary based upon these revenue sources 
generally  sales of technology products and third party software are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
using these tests  the vast majority of our product sales are recognized upon delivery due to our sales terms with our customers and with our vendors 
for proper cutoff  we estimate the product delivered to our customers at the end of each quarter based upon historical delivery dates 
we sell software assurance  maintenance and service contracts where the services are performed by a third party 
software assurance is a maintenance product that allows customers to upgrade at no additional cost to the latest technology if new applications are introduced during the period that the software assurance is in effect 
as we enter into contracts with third party service providers  we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or agent in the transaction 
since we are not responsible for the day to day provision of services in these arrangements  we concluded that we are acting as an agent and recognize revenue on a net basis at the date of sale 
we also sell services that are performed by us in conjunction with product sales 
we adopted asu revenue recognition on a prospective basis on april  for bundled arrangements entered into after march   we allocated the total arrangement consideration to the deliverables based on an estimated selling price of our products and services 
we determined the estimated selling price using cost plus a reasonable margin for each deliverable  which was based on our established policies and procedures for providing customers with quotes  as well as historical gross margins for our products and services 
revenue from the sales of products is generally recognized upon delivery to the customers and revenue for the services performed by us is generally recognized when the services are complete  which normally occurs within days after the products are delivered to the customer 
financing revenues include income earned from investments in leases  leased equipment  third party software and services 
we classify our investments in leases and leased equipment as either direct financing lease  sales type lease  or operating lease  as appropriate 
revenue on direct financing and sales type leases is deferred at the inception of the leases and is recognized over the term of the lease using the interest method 
revenue on operating leases is recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
we classify third party software and services that we finance for our customers as notes receivables and recognize interest income over the term of the arrangement using the effective interest method 
residual values 
residual values represent our estimated value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term 
our estimated residual values will vary  both in amount and as a percentage of the original equipment cost  and depend upon several factors  including the equipment type  manufacturer s discount  market conditions  lease term  equipment supply and demand  and new product announcements by manufacturers 
we evaluate residual values on a quarterly basis and record any required impairments of residual value  in the period in which the impairment is determined 
no upward adjustment to residual values is made subsequent to lease inception 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets we have acquired in business combinations 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a sustained  significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and or slower growth rates  among others 
we review our goodwill for impairment quarterly  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a sustained  significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and or slower growth rates  among others 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
qualitative factors we consider include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  company specific events  changes in circumstances  after tax cash flows and market capitalization 
if the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we perform the two step process to assess our goodwill for impairment 
first  we compare the fair value of our reporting units with its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using various valuation methodologies  including discounted expected future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired  and no further testing is necessary 
if the net book value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
to measure the amount of any impairment loss  we determine the fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the estimated fair value of goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet  we record an impairment charge for the difference 
vendor consideration 
we receive payments and credits from vendors  including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs  volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs 
many of these programs extend over one or more quarters sales activities and are primarily formula based 
different programs have different vendor program specific goals to achieve 
these programs can be very complex to calculate and  in some cases  targets are estimated based upon historical data 
vendor consideration received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales  product and services on our consolidated statements of operations 
vendor consideration received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated to inventories based on the applicable incentives from each vendor and is recorded in cost of sales  product and services  as the inventory is sold 
vendor consideration received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place only if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs 
consideration that exceeds the specific  incremental  identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of cost of sales  product and services on our consolidated statements of operations 
reserves for credit losses 
we maintain our reserves for credit losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the respective balances 
we assign an internal credit quality rating to all new customers and update these ratings regularly  but no less than annually 
management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for our accounts and notes receivable is based on the age of the receivable balance  the customer s credit quality rating  an evaluation of historical credit losses  current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for minimum lease payments associated with investments in direct financing and sales type leases may be based on the following factors an internally assigned credit quality rating  historical credit loss experience  current economic conditions  volume  growth  the composition of the lease portfolio  the fair value of the underlying collateral  and the funding status ie not funded  funded on a recourse or partial recourse basis  or funded on non recourse basis 
we recorded reserves for credit losses of million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the reserve for credit losses for the year ended march  included a specific reserve of million due to a specific customer  which recently filed for bankruptcy 
reserves for sales returns 
sales are reported net of returns and allowances  which are maintained at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential sales returns from product and services 
management s determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based on an evaluation of historical sales returns and other relevant factors 
these determinations require considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate potential for sales returns and include consideration of the type and volume of product sold 

table of contents income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
the calculation of our tax liabilities also involves considering uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be required 
business combinations 
we account for business combinations using the acquisition method  which requires that the total purchase price of each of the acquired entities be allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price of the acquired entities may include an estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration 
the allocation process requires an analysis of intangible assets  customer relationships  trade names  acquired contractual rights and assumed contractual commitments and legal contingencies to identify and record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
to the extent the purchase price is less than the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we recognize a gain in our income statement 
the results of operations for an acquired company are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
results of operations the year ended march  compared to the year ended march  technology sales business segment the results of operations for our technology sales business segment for the years ended march  and were as follows in thousands year ended march  change sales of product and services fee and other income patent settlement income total revenues cost of sales  products and services professional and other fees salaries and benefits general and administrative total costs and expenses segment earnings 
table of contents total revenues 
total revenues for the year ended march  increased by million  or  to million  due to increased sales of products and services 
in calendar year  it spending in most categories increased driven by the general economic recovery  the deferral of it spending by many customers in prior years  and the investment in new technologies 
as a result  demand for our products and services increased over the prior year 
we had year over year growth in our quarterly sales of products and services during the year ended march  we experienced sequential increases in quarterly sales of products and services during the fiscal year  except for a slight decrease in the quarter ended march   as we had higher demand for our products and services during our second and third quarters 
the sequential and year over year change in sales of products and services is summarized below quarter ended sequential year over year june  september  december  march  we rely on our vendors to fulfill shipments to our customers  which have been occurring on a regular basis 
our average open orders for the years ended march  and were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we had deferred revenue of million at march   compared to million at march   relating to bundled hardware and service arrangements entered into prior to our adoption of asu multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
these arrangements were not completed at march  and therefore  were not recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenue on these multiple deliverable revenue arrangements when the services are completed 
total costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses for the year ended march  increased million or  to million due to increases in cost of sales  products and services  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses  partially offset by professional and other fees 
the increase in cost of sales  products and services was consistent with the increase in sales of products and services 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services decreased to for the year ended march   from in the prior year 
our gross margin was affected by the mix between products and services  vendor incentives earned  and competitive pricing pressures 
the change in the amount of vendor incentives earned during the year ended march  resulted in a decrease in gross margin for products and services 
there are ongoing changes to the incentives programs offered to us by our vendors 
accordingly  if we are unable to maintain the level of manufacturer incentives we are currently receiving  gross margins may decrease 
professional and other fees decreased million  or  to million  compared to million during the prior year 
these decreases are primarily due to lower legal and other fees related to the patent infringement litigation  which were million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
these types of patent infringement cases are complex in nature  and are likely to have significant expenses associated with them 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in our claims for damages  whether any award ultimately received will exceed the costs incurred to pursue these matters  or how long it will take to bring these matters to resolution 
salaries and benefits expense increased million or to million  compared to million during the prior year 
this increase was driven by increases in the number of employees and commission expenses 
our technology sales business segment had employees as of march   an increase of from at march  a total of employees were added as a result of the three acquisitions we completed during the year  the remaining increase was due to internal growth 
most of the increase relates to sales  marketing and engineering personnel 
we continue to invest in sales and support personnel through hiring and strategic acquisitions in order to expand our geographical presence in the continental us as well as extend our advanced technology solutions offerings 
in addition  commission expenses increased due to the increase in the sales of products and services during the fiscal year ended march  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to prior year  due to the higher travel and other expenses associated with the increase in sales and support personnel  higher rent and depreciation expenses related to acquisitions

total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended march  due to a decrease in financing revenue and fee and other income revenue 
financing revenue generally falls into two categories portfolio income  which consists of earnings on notes  direct financing leases  operating leases and other renewal rent  and transactional income  which consists of sales of financing receivables and leased equipment 
for the year ended march   financing revenue decreased million  or  due to a decrease in portfolio income of million as a result of a decrease in our average investment in direct financing and sales type leases during the year combined with a lower earnings rate on the portfolio 
our investments in notes and leases increased as of march  to million from million in the prior year  which was due to additional investments made during the quarter ended march  total costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses increased million  or  primarily due to increases in general and administrative costs  which increased million  or  to million 
the increase in general and administrative cost is primarily due to an increase in our reserve for credit losses of million of which a significant portion is due to a specific customer  which recently filed for bankruptcy 
our financing business segment employed people as of march  which decreased from people employed as of march  segment earnings 
as a result of the foregoing  segment earnings decreased million  or  to million for the year ended march  consolidated interest and financing costs 
interest and financing costs decreased million or to million during the year ended march   as compared to million during the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to lower non recourse note balances as well as lower interest rates 
non recourse notes payable decreased to million at march  as compared to million at march   this was partially offset by the addition of million in recourse notes payable as of march  there was no recourse notes payable as of march  income taxes 
our provision for income taxes decreased million or to million for the year ended march  our effective income tax rates for the years ended march  and were and  respectively 
the decrease in effective income tax rate is primarily due to a change in state apportionment factors and a decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax positions

patent settlement income decreased due to a settlement and license agreement entered into during the year ended march   with three defendants  wherein the complaint was dismissed with prejudice and each defendant was granted a license in specified eplus patents 
during the years ended march  and  we received thousand and million  respectively  of payments related to this settlement agreement 
total costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses for the year ended march  increased million or  to million due to increases in cost of sales  products and services  professional and other fees and salaries and benefits 
the increase in cost of sales  products and services was consistent with the increase in sales of products and services 
our gross margin on the sale of products and services increased to for the year ended march   from in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to changes in the customer product mix as well as additional vendor incentives earned 
the change in the amount of vendor incentives earned during the year ended march  resulted in a increase to our gross margins for products and services 

table of contents there are ongoing changes to the incentives programs offered to us by our vendors 
accordingly  we may not be able to maintain the level of manufacturer incentives we are currently receiving  which may cause gross margins to change 
professional and other fees increased million  or  to million  compared to million during the prior year 
these increases are primarily due to increased legal and other fees related to the patent infringement litigation  which were million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
these types of patent infringement cases are complex in nature  are likely to have significant expenses associated with them 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in our claims for damages  whether any award ultimately received will exceed the costs incurred to pursue these matters  or how long it will take to bring these matters to resolution 
salaries and benefits expense increased million or to million  compared to million during the prior year 
this increase is driven by increased commissions associated with the increase in sales and gross profit during the year  as well as an increase in salaries due to an increase the number of employees

liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds from operations  and borrowings  both non recourse and recourse 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which have historically consisted primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures  purchases of lease equipment  payments of principal and interest on indebtedness outstanding  acquisitions and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
our subsidiary eplus technology  inc  part of our technology sales business segment  finances its operations with funds generated from operations  and with a credit facility with general electric commercial distribution finance gecdf  which is described in more detail below 
there are two components of this facility a floor plan component  and an accounts receivable component 
after a customer places a purchase order with us and we have completed our credit check  we place an order for the equipment with one of our vendors 
generally  most purchase orders from us to our vendors are first financed under the floor plan component and reflected in accounts payable floor plan in our consolidated balance sheets 
payments on the floor plan component are due on three specified dates each month  generally days from the invoice date 
on the due date of the invoices financed by the floor plan component  the invoices are paid by the accounts receivable component of the credit facility 
the balance of the accounts receivable component is then reduced by payments from our available cash 
the outstanding balance under the accounts receivable component is recorded as recourse notes payable on our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
there was no balance outstanding under the account receivable component at march  or march   while the maximum credit limit was million for both periods 
the borrowings and repayments under the floor plan component are reflected as net borrowings on floor plan facility in the cash flows from financing activities section of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 
most customer payments in our technology sales business segment are remitted to our lockboxes 
once payments are cleared  the monies in the lockbox accounts are automatically transferred to our operating account on a daily basis 
on the due dates of the floor plan component  we make cash payments to gecdf 
these payments from the accounts receivable component to the floor plan component and repayments from our cash are reflected as net borrowings repayments on floor plan facility in the cash flows from the financing activities section of our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we engage in this payment structure in order to minimize our interest expense and bank fees in connection with financing the operations of our technology sales business segment 
we believe that cash and short term investments on hand  funds generated from operations  amounts available under our credit facility  and funds available through the monetization of our investment portfolio will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 

table of contents our ability to continue to fund our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate requiring any additional sources of financing to fund operations  if demand for it products declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected 
cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated in thousands year ended march  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operating activities totaled million in the year ended march   primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of million  increase inventories of million and net investments in direct financing and sales type leases of million 
in addition  salaries and commissions payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities also decreased by million as we have less deferred revenue related to bundled hardware and services arrangement 
these increases in cash used are due to a significant increase in sales over last fiscal year 
partially offsetting the cash used was a decrease in other assets of million mainly due to lower deferred costs and prepaid taxes  and increases of accounts payable equipment and accounts payable trade of million and million  respectively  as a result of increased sales 
cash used in operating activities totaled million in the year ended march   resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts payable equipment of million as we paid for equipment associated with leases and an increase of million related to accounts receivable net 
this decrease was partially offset by a decrease of million in increase in investment in direct financing and sale type leases net  and million increase in salaries and commissions payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities 
cash used in operating activities totaled million in the year ended march   resulted primarily from net investments in direct financing and sales type leases of million 
in addition  there was an increase in accounts receivable of million due to an increase in sales of product and services during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal these changes are partially offset by changes in accounts payable equipment due to the timing of payments for equipment leased to our customers 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities were million during the year ended march   primarily due to cash used in acquisitions of million  purchase of property  equipment and operating lease equipment of million  increase in short term investments of million  and the net issuance of notes receivable of million 
this use of cash was offset by proceeds from sales of property  equipment and operating lease equipment of million 
cash used in investing activities were million during the year ended march   primarily driven by purchases of property  equipment and operating lease equipment of million  partially offset by proceeds from sale or disposal of property  equipment and operating lease equipment of million cash used in investing activities were million during the year ended march   primarily driven by purchases of property  equipment and operating lease equipment of million  partially offset by proceeds from sale or disposal of operating lease equipment of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended march   and  respectively  which was driven by borrowings of recourse and non recourse notes payable and net borrowings from our floor plan facility 
borrowings from recourse and non recourse notes payable and floor plan in the year ended march   was million and million  respectively  which was partially offset by purchases of treasury stock of million 

table of contents non cash activities we assign lease payments to third party financial institutions  which are accounted for as non recourse notes payable financing activities 
as a condition to the assignment agreement  certain financial institutions may request that the lessee remit their lease payments to a trust  rather than to us  and the trust pays the financial institution 
alternatively  if the structure of the agreement does not require a trustee  the lessee will continue to make payments to us  and we will remit the payment to the financial institution 
the economic impact to us under either assignment structure is similar  in that the assigned lease receivable is paid by the lessee and remitted to the lender to pay down the corresponding non recourse notes payable 
however  these assignment structures are classified differently within our consolidated statements of cash flows 
more specifically  we are required to exclude non cash transactions from our consolidated statement of cash flows  so lease payments made by the lessee to the trust are excluded from our operating cash receipts and the corresponding re payment of the non recourse notes payable from the trust to the third party financial institution are excluded from our cash flows from financing activities 
given the assignment of lease payment is economically the same regardless of the structure of the payments  we evaluate our cash flows from operating and financing activities as if the assignments of lease payments have been structured without an intermediary 
the non gaap financial measure for our cash flows from operating activities for the years ended march   and is as follows in thousands year ended march  gaap net cash used in operating activities principal payments from lessees directly to lenders non gaap adjusted net cash provided by or used in operating activities the non gaap financial measure for our cash flows from financing activities for the years ended march   and is as follows in thousands year ended march  gaap net cash provided by financing activities principal payments from lessees directly to lenders non gaap adjusted net cash provided by or used in financing activities a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows of the company  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
we use the financial measures in its internal evaluation and management of its business 
we believe that these measures and the information they provide are useful to investors because they permit investors to view our performance using the same tools that we use to evaluate our ongoing business performance 
these measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by gaap  such as net income and earnings per share 
these non gaap measures are unlikely to be comparable to non gaap information provided by other companies 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources recourse and non recourse notes payable financing activities may provide approximately to of the purchase price of the equipment we purchase for leases to our customers 
any balance of the purchase price remaining after recourse and non recourse funding and any upfront payments received from the lessee our equity investment in the equipment must generally be financed by cash flows from our operations  the sale of the equipment leased to third parties  or other internal means 
although we expect that the credit quality of our leases and our residual return history will continue to allow us to obtain financing  such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the financing necessary to support our leasing activities has been provided by our cash and recourse and non recourse borrowings 
we monitor our exposure closely 
historically  we have obtained recourse and non recourse borrowings from banks and finance companies 
we continue to be able to obtain financing through our traditional lending sources 
non recourse financings are loans whose repayment is the responsibility of a specific customer  although we may make representations and warranties to the lender regarding the specific contract or have ongoing loan servicing obligations 
under a non recourse loan  we borrow from a lender an amount based on the present value of the contractually committed lease payments under the lease at a fixed rate of interest  and the lender secures a lien on the financed assets 
when the lender is fully repaid from the lease payments  the lien is released and all further rental or sale proceeds are ours 
we generally are not liable for the repayment of non recourse loans unless we breach our representations and warranties in the loan agreements 
the lender assumes the credit risk of each lease  and the lender s only recourse  upon default by the lessee  is against the lessee and the specific equipment under lease 
at march   our non recourse notes payable portfolio decreased to million  as compared to million at march  but this reduction in non recourse notes payable was partially offset by an addition of million in recourse notes payable as of march  there was no recourse notes payable as of march  whenever desirable  we arrange for equity investment financing  which includes selling lease payments  including the residual portions  to third parties and financing the equity investment on a non recourse basis 
we generally retain customer control and operational services  and have minimal residual risk 
we usually reserve the right to share in remarketing proceeds of the equipment on a subordinated basis after the investor has received an agreed to return on its investment 
credit facility technology business our subsidiary  eplus technology  inc  has a financing facility from gecdf to finance its working capital requirements for inventories and accounts receivable 
there are two components of this facility a floor plan component  and an accounts receivable component 
this facility has full recourse to eplus technology  inc 
and is secured by a blanket lien against all its assets  such as chattel paper  receivables and inventory 
as of march   the facility had an aggregate limit of the two components of million with an accounts receivable sub limit of million 
availability under the gecdf facility may be limited by the asset value of equipment we purchase and the aging of our accounts receivable and may be further limited by certain covenants and terms and conditions of the facility 
these covenants include but are not limited to a minimum total tangible net worth and subordinated debt of eplus technology  inc  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of eplus technology  inc 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of march  in addition  the facility restricts the ability of eplus technology  inc 
to transfer funds to its affiliates in the form of dividends  loans or advances  however  we do not expect these restrictions to have an impact on the ability of eplus inc 
to meet its cash obligations or materially restrict its ability to undertake additional debt or equity financing 
either party may terminate with days advance notice 
we are not  and do not believe that we are reasonably likely to be  in breach of the gecdf credit facility 
in addition  we do not believe that the covenants of the gecdf credit facility materially limit our ability to undertake financing 
in this regard  the covenants apply only to our subsidiary  eplus technology  inc 
this credit facility is secured by the assets of only eplus technology  inc 
and the guaranty as described below 
the facility provided by gecdf requires a guaranty of up to million by eplus inc 
the loss of the gecdf credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our future results as we currently rely on this facility and its components for daily working capital and liquidity for our technology sales business and as an operational function of our accounts payable process 
we believe that we can continue to rely on the availability of this credit facility  however  if the gecdf credit facility is no longer available  we believe we can increase our lines of credit with our vendors and utilize our cash for working capital 

table of contents floor plan component the traditional business of eplus technology  inc 
as a seller of computer technology  related peripherals and software products  is in part financed through a floor plan component in which interest expense for the first thirty to forty five days  in general  is not charged 
the floor plan liabilities are recorded as accounts payable floor plan on our consolidated balance sheets  as they are normally repaid within the thirty to forty five day time frame and represent an assigned accounts payable originally generated with the manufacturer distributor 
if the thirty to forty five day obligation is not paid timely  interest is then assessed at stated contractual rates

the balance of the accounts receivable component is then reduced by payments from our available cash 
the outstanding balance under the accounts receivable component is recorded as recourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets 
there was no balance outstanding for the accounts receivable component at march  or march   while the maximum credit limit was million for both periods 
credit facility general st commonwealth bank of virginia provides us with a million credit facility  which will mature on october  this credit facility is available for use by us and our affiliates and is full recourse to us 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at wall street journal us prime rate plus 
the primary purpose of the facility is to provide letters of credit for landlords  taxing authorities and bids 
as of march  and march   we had no outstanding balance on this credit facility 
performance guarantees in the normal course of business  we may provide certain customers with performance guarantees  which are generally backed by surety bonds 
in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations 
we are in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee  and we believe that any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of march  and march   we were not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entity transactions 
adequacy of capital resources the continued implementation of our business strategy will require a significant investment in both resources and managerial focus 
in addition  we may selectively acquire other companies that have attractive customer relationships and skilled sales forces 
we may also start offices in new geographic areas  which may require a significant investment of cash 
we may also acquire technology companies to expand and enhance the platform of bundled solutions to provide additional functionality and value added services 
as a result  we may require additional financing to fund our strategy  implementation and potential future acquisitions  which may include additional debt and equity financing 
inflation for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 

table of contents future contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of march  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years recourse non recourse notes payable operating lease obligations total non recourse notes payable obligations in which the specific lease receivable payments have been assigned to the lender 
rent obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although a substantial portion of our liabilities are non recourse  fixed interest rate instruments  we utilize our lines of credit and other financing facilities which are subject to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
these instruments  which are denominated in us dollars  were entered into for other than trading purposes and  with the exception of amounts drawn under the gecdf facility  bear interest at a fixed rate 
because the interest rate on these instruments is fixed  changes in interest rates will not directly impact our cash flows 
borrowings under the gecdf facility bear interest at a market based variable rate 
as of march   the aggregate fair value of our recourse borrowings approximated their carrying value 
we have operations in canada and iceland 
as such  we have entered into lease contracts and non recourse  fixed interest rate financing denominated in canadian dollars and icelandic krona 
to date  our canadian and icelandic operations have been insignificant and we believe that potential fluctuations in currency exchange rates will not have a material effect on our financial position
