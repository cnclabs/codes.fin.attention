partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in the employee benefits business of approximately million due to client attrition and to a lesser extent  downsizing of client workforce and employer plan design changes  and a decline of million in property and casualty revenues due to soft market conditions in pricing and lower volume based carrier bonus payments

occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature  and excluding the costs associated with the divested wealth management businesses of million for the year ended december   were million for the years ended december  and gross margin percent was impacted by three factors 
the decline in volume based carrier bonus payments has a direct negative impact on gross margin  since there are no corresponding expenses associated with these revenues 
in addition  the decrease in operating revenues in both the employee benefits and property casualty businesses played a role in the margin decline  despite a corresponding savings in variable sales commissions 
these were offset  in part  by an increase from retirement advisory and human capital advisory revenues 
asset based revenues do not have related direct costs  and human capital advisory revenues have a more fixed cost structure  therefore  growth in those revenues has a favorable impact on gross margin

occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature and were million for the years ended december  and  excluding the costs related to the acquired businesses of million 
the slight decrease in gross margin percent was primarily attributable to two offsetting factors 
the shortfall in revenue at the specialty life insurance operation  which typically functions at a high margin  had a negative impact even though corresponding variable external broker commissions were proportionally lower 
this was offset  in large part  by an increase from retirement advisory and individual wealth management revenues  as well as human capital advisory revenues  as mentioned above 
asset based and investment revenues do not have related direct costs  and human capital advisory revenues have a more fixed cost structure  therefore  growth in those revenues has a favorable impact on gross margin

facilities costs decreased million for the year ended december   but increased as a percentage of revenue to versus in the comparable period in the decrease in gross margin is the result of continued pricing and reimbursement pressure as discussed previously 
national practices year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages revenue same unit acquired businesses divested operations total revenue operating expenses gross margin gross margin percent the national practices group is primarily comprised of a cost plus contract with cbiz s largest client edward jones  healthcare consulting  and the company s mergers and acquisition business 
revenues from the edward jones business account for approximately two thirds of the national practice group s revenue  with the healthcare consulting and mergers and acquisitions accounting for the remaining revenue 
the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decrease of approximately million in the healthcare consulting business and approximately million in the mergers and acquisitions business  offset by an increase in revenue of approximately million in services provided to edward jones 
the decrease in healthcare consulting was primarily the result of a decrease in the medical audit services line of business which provides services to healthcare providers to ensure they are correctly applying for and receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
the decrease in revenue related to cbiz s mergers and acquisition business was due to less success fees being earned as a result of fewer transactions being closed 
the increase in the edward jones revenue was primarily a result of additional services provided under the contract 
the largest components of operating expenses for the national practices group are personnel costs  occupancy costs and travel and related costs  representing and of operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
personnel expenses increased million and were of revenue for the year ended december  compared to of revenue for the comparable period in an increase of approximately million in personnel cost was necessary to support revenue growth from services provided to edward jones as well as annual merit increases 
this was offset by a million decrease in personnel costs related to the healthcare consulting business as a result of the decline in revenue and demand for services 
travel and related costs were consistent in both periods and were million for the years ended december  and occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature and were million for the years ended december  and the decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to less success fees earned by the mergers and acquisitions business as well as the impact of the decline in healthcare consulting revenue during the year ended december  versus transactions completed by the mergers and acquisitions business generally 
table of contents results in a large amount of revenue with modest incremental costs 
fewer success fees have a disproportionate negative impact on gross margin percent 
the decline in healthcare revenue resulted in a decrease in overall healthcare related operating expenses  but not to the extent to preserve gross margin

these additions were partially offset by payments on the notes of approximately million 
other liabilities current and non current increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of approximately million of estimated contingent purchase price liabilities and million of guaranteed purchase price related to business acquisitions  a million increase in unearned revenue  a million fair value adjustment related to the swap agreement  a million net present value adjustment to the estimated contingent purchase price liabilities  and a million increase in the legal reserve

cbiz s convertible notes are carried at face value less unamortized discount 
the million decrease in the carrying value of the current and non current convertible notes at december  compared to december  represents the repurchase of million of the notes  partially offset by the discount amortization on the notes and convertible senior subordinated notes notes of million and million  respectively  which is recognized as non cash interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the convertible notes are further disclosed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
bank debt for amounts due on cbiz s credit facility increased million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to the repurchase of million of the notes  million in payments for current year acquisitions and contingent payments on prior acquisitions  and expenditures of million to repurchase million shares of cbiz common stock 
these increases were partially offset by cash earned from operating activities 
income taxes payable non current at december  and december  was million and million  respectively  and represents the accrual for uncertain tax positions

liquidity and capital resources cbiz s principal source of net operating cash is derived from the collection of fees and commissions for professional services and products rendered to its clients 
cbiz supplements net operating cash with a million unsecured credit facility and million in notes 
cbiz maintains a million unsecured credit facility with bank of america as agent bank for a group of seven participating banks 
the credit facility also has a letter of credit sub facility 
on april   the credit facility was amended to extend the maturity date one year to june  reduce interest on outstanding balances  reduce commitment fees on the unused borrowing limit  and adjust the leverage ratio limits to provide cbiz with more flexibility 
at december   cbiz had million outstanding under its credit facility and had letters of credit and performance guarantees totaling million 
available funds under the credit facility  based on the terms of the commitment  were approximately million at december  management believes that cash generated from operations  combined with the available funds from the credit facility  provides cbiz the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
the credit facility also allows for the allocation of funds for strategic initiatives  including acquisitions and the repurchase of cbiz common stock 
under the credit facility  cbiz is required to meet certain financial covenants with respect to i minimum net worth  ii maximum total and senior leverage ratios  and iii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
cbiz believes it is in compliance with its covenants as of december  cbiz s ability to service its debt and to fund strategic initiatives will depend upon its ability to generate cash in the future 
the notes were issued to qualified institutional buyers on september  and mature on october  the holders of the notes may convert their notes any time on or after july  concurrent with the closing of the notes  a portion of the proceeds was used to repurchase million of the million outstanding notes through privately negotiated transactions

cbiz typically experiences a net use of cash from operations during the first quarter of its fiscal year  as accounts receivable balances grow in response to the seasonal increase in first quarter revenue generated by the financial services practice group primarily for accounting and tax services 
this net use of cash is followed by strong operating cash flow during the second and third quarters  as a significant amount of revenue generated by the financial services practice group during the first four months of the year are billed and collected in subsequent quarters 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million and primarily consisted of net income of million  non cash adjustments to net income of million  and net changes in working capital of million 
partially offsetting these sources of cash were a net gain on the sale of operations and discontinued operations transactions totaling million 
the non cash adjustments to net income primarily consist of depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets including client lists and non compete agreements  amortization of the discount on convertible notes and deferred financing fees  stock based compensation expense  deferred income tax expense  provision for bad debts  and adjustments to contingent purchase price liabilities

the above table does not reflect million of unrecognized tax benefits  which the company has recorded for uncertain tax positions as cbiz is unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements cbiz maintains asa s with independent cpa firms as described more fully under business financial services and in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which qualify as variable interest entities 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the operations or accounts of variable interest entities as the impact is not material to the consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows of cbiz 

table of contents cbiz provides guarantees of performance obligations for a cpa firm with which cbiz maintains an asa 
potential obligations under the guarantees totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cbiz has recognized a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing these guarantees 
the liability is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cbiz does not expect it will be required to make payments under these guarantees 
cbiz provides letters of credit to landlords lessors of its leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits 
letters of credit totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  cbiz provides license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements 
the amount of license bonds outstanding was million and million at december  and  respectively 
cbiz has various agreements under which the company may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which the company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
payment by cbiz under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim 
such claims are typically subject to challenge by cbiz and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  cbiz s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  cbiz may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by cbiz 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of cbiz s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  cbiz has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of december   cbiz was not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively mitigate cbiz s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of the floating rate debt under the credit facility  to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december   cbiz had a total of million notional amount of interest rate swaps  of which million will expire in june and the remaining million will expire in june at december   cbiz had interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million which expired in january management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
cbiz does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cbiz carries million in notes bearing a fixed interest rate of 
the notes mature on october  and may not be converted before july  cbiz believes the fixed nature of these borrowings mitigate its interest rate risk 
in connection with payroll services provided to clients  cbiz collects funds from its clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations 
these funds held for clients are segregated and invested in accordance with the company s investment policy  which requires all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of initial investment 
the interest income on these investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of cbiz s credit facility  as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility are based on market conditions 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make 
table of contents estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements 
cbiz s management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the policies discussed below address the most critical accounting policies which are the most important to the portrayal of cbiz s financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
contract terms are typically contained in a signed agreement with the client or when applicable  other third parties which generally defines the scope of services to be provided  pricing of services  and payment terms generally ranging from invoice date to days after invoice date 
billing may occur prior to  during  or upon completion of the service 
cbiz typically does not have acceptance provisions or right of refund arrangements included in these agreements 
contract terms vary depending on the scope of service provided  the deliverables  and the complexity of the engagement 
cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through four practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided in more detail in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable management determines the valuation of accounts receivable including unbilled accounts receivable and notes receivable  and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to the respective receivable balance 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectability of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts for each accounting period 
material differences may result if facts and circumstances change in relation to the original estimation 
valuation of goodwill cbiz utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  which include client lists and non compete agreements  are amortized over their expected period of benefit  not to exceed ten years 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment testing may be performed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
during the fourth quarter of  cbiz early adopted the principles as prescribed in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu in order to complete its goodwill impairment tests 
in accordance with asu  cbiz based its goodwill impairment testing on a qualitative assessment for each of its reporting units that carried a goodwill balance 
the qualitative assessment included an in depth analysis of many factors  including general economic conditions  industry and market conditions  a broad scope of financial factors  the company s weighted average cost of capital  changes in management and key personnel  the company s price of its common stock  as well as other drivers of a fair value analysis 
as part of the qualitative analysis  many estimates and assumptions were made that related to future economic trends  client behaviors  and other factors  all of which are beyond the control of management 
as a result of the 
table of contents company s qualitative assessment  it was concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was greater than its carrying value 
as part of the goodwill impairment testing that was performed in the fourth quarter of  it was noted that two reporting units  cbiz payroll and mmp  were tested in detail applying step one procedures due to a decline in the performance of each reporting unit 
the step one procedures utilized a combination of the discounted cash flow method income approach and the market comparable method market approach 
as a result of the step one procedures in the fourth quarter of  it was concluded that these two reporting units were not impaired and the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least 
during the goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of  these two reporting units were closely analyzed 
cbiz payroll financial results have improved over the past year and are expected to continue to improve during and beyond  thus cbiz payroll is not considered to be at risk for impairment 
however  mmp has continued to face economic pressures 
several cost cutting measures were put into place during the year ended december  to mitigate the pricing and performance pressures 
taking into consideration the company s efforts to control costs and obtain market share  as well as the other qualitative factors that were described above as part of the fourth quarter goodwill impairment testing procedures  the company has concluded that the fair value of mmp is more likely than not to be greater than its carrying value 
however  significant deterioration in the operating results of the mmp reporting unit during could result in possible impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill balance  which was million at december  loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 
incentive compensation determining the amount of expense to recognize for incentive compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves management judgment 
expenses accrued for incentive compensation are based upon expected financial results for the year  and the ultimate determination of incentive compensation is unable to be made until after year end results are finalized 
thus  amounts accrued are subject to change in future interim periods if actual future financial results are higher or lower than expected 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves management judgment 
management estimates an annual effective tax rate which takes into consideration expected full year results  which is applied to the company s quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in the quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
in addition  reserves are established for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
see note and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
circumstances that could cause cbiz s estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as cbiz prepares its corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the receipt and expected utilization of federal and state income tax credits  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available when estimating income taxes 

table of contents other significant policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of management judgment and uncertainty as those discussed above  are also critical in understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the quantitative two step impairment test is required  otherwise  no further testing is necessary 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
asu is effective for annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
cbiz adopted the provisions of asu for its annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter of in june  the fasb issued asu no 
asu comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which states that comprehensive income should be presented in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
companies will have the option to either present other comprehensive income on the same statement as net income  or as a separate statement that immediately follows the statement of net income 
asu is effective for the first reporting period after december   and should be applied retrospectively 
currently  other comprehensive income is presented in the notes to cbiz s consolidated financial statements and the adoption of asu will result in cbiz presenting other comprehensive income on the consolidated statements of operations 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
asu fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu provides a consistent definition of fair value to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu does not extend the use of fair value  but rather provides additional disclosure guidance about the application of fair value in those areas where fair value is already required or permitted  especially for level fair value measurements 
asu is effective for the first reporting period after december  the amendments of this asu will be applied prospectively  and early adoption is not permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting asu  but currently believes there will be no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by bank of america  na  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
cbiz s balance outstanding under its credit facility at december  was million 
if market rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease approximately million annually 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively modify the company s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of its floating rate debt under the credit facility to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate 
table of contents interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december   cbiz had a total of million notional amount of interest rate swaps  of which million will expire in june and the remaining million will expire in june management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding interest rate swaps 
in connection with cbiz s payroll business  funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments  such as corporate and municipal bonds 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial investment 
at each respective balance sheet date  these investments are adjusted to fair value with fair value adjustments being recorded to other comprehensive income or loss for the respective period 
if an adjustment is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired due to credit loss  then the adjustment is recorded to other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these investments and the related fair value assessments
