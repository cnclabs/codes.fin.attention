overview we are a global provider of unified web  email and data security solutions designed to protect an organization s data and users from external and internal threats  including modern cyber threats  advanced malware attacks  information leaks  legal liability and productivity loss 
our customers deploy our subscription software solutions on standard servers or other it hardware  including our optimized appliances  as a saas offering  or in a hybrid hardware saas configuration 
our products and services are sold worldwide to provide content security to enterprise customers  smbs  public sector entities  and internet service providers through a network of distributors  value added resellers and oems 
our products use our advanced content classification  deep content inspection  and policy enforcement technologies to prevent access to undesirable and dangerous elements on the web  including web pages that download viruses  spyware  keyloggers  hacking tools and an ever increasing variety of malicious code  and web sites that contain inappropriate content  identify and remove malware from incoming web content  manage the use of social web sites  manage the use of non web internet traffic  such as peer to peer communications and instant messaging  prevent misuse of computing resources  including unauthorized downloading of high bandwidth content  inspect the content of encrypted web traffic to prevent data loss  malware and access to web sites with inappropriate content  filter spam  viruses and malicious attachments from incoming email and instant messages  and protect against data loss by identifying and categorizing sensitive or confidential data and enforcing pre determined policies regarding its use and transmission within and outside the organization 
since we commenced operations in  websense has evolved from a reseller of network security products to a leading developer and provider of it security software solutions 
our first commercial software product was released in and controlled employee access to inappropriate web sites 
since then  we have focused on developing our web filtering and content classification capabilities to address the internet and the external threat environment  including the rise of web based social and business applications and the growing incidence of sophisticated  targeted cyber attacks designed to steal valuable information 
we derived approximately of our revenues from international sales during  and  with the united kingdom comprising approximately  and of our total revenues during  and  respectively 
we believe international markets continue to represent a significant growth opportunity and we are continuing to expand our international operations  particularly in selected countries in the european  asia pacific and latin american markets 
annual report 
table of contents we utilize a multi tiered distribution strategy globally and sell our products through indirect distributors and value added reseller channels 
sales through indirect channels currently account for approximately of our revenues 
in north america  we use ingram micro and arrow enterprise computing solutions to distribute our products and provide credit facilities  marketing support and other services to regional and local value added resellers who sell to end user customers 
ingram micro accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during  and  respectively  and distributed our products to approximately  resellers in north america in we also have several arrangements with oems that grant them the right to incorporate our products and services into their products for resale to end users 
we sell subscriptions to our software and saas products  generally in  or month contract durations  based on the number of seats or devices managed 
as described elsewhere in this report  we recognize revenues from subscriptions to our software and saas products on a daily straight line basis  commencing on the day the term of the subscription begins  over the term of the subscription agreement 
we recognize revenues associated with oem contracts ratably over the contractual period for which we are obligated to provide our services 
we generally recognize the operating expenses related to these sales as they are incurred 
these operating expenses include sales commissions  which are based on the total amount of the subscription agreement and are fully expensed in the period the product and or software activation key are delivered 
our operating expenses  including cost of revenues  in increased as compared with  primarily due to increased cost of revenues from the immediate recognition of appliance cost of sales as a result of the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards in january and our increased headcount  partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately million and to a lesser extent the overall favorable movement of currency exchange rates 
billings represent the amount of subscription contracts  oem royalties and appliance sales billed to customers during the applicable period 
any excess of billings booked in a period compared with revenue recognized in that same period results in an increase in deferred revenue at the end of the period compared with the beginning of the period 
our primarily subscription based business model operates such that subscription billings are recorded initially to our balance sheet as deferred revenue and then recognized to our income statement as revenue ratably over the subscription term or  in the case of oem arrangements  over the contractual obligation period 
our billings are not a numerical measure that can be calculated in accordance with gaap 
we provide this measurement net of distributor marketing payments  channel rebates and adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts in reporting financial performance because this measurement provides a consistent basis for understanding our sales activities each period 
we believe the billings measurement is useful because the gaap measurements of revenue and deferred revenue in the current period include subscription contracts commenced in prior periods 
billings to end user customers increased year over year to million in compared with million in billings from oem arrangements declined from million in to million in our total billings  including our oem business  grew from million in to million in billings from our triton content security solutions accounted for of total billings in and grew year over year from million in to million in  whereas billings from our non triton solution products declined from million in to million in  reflecting migration of existing customers to our more advanced triton security solutions  as well as decreased seats and shorter contract duration from customers experiencing financial distress and customer loss to lower priced competitive solutions 
our triton solutions include our triton family of security gateways for web  email and data security including appliances  our standalone data security suite and our cloud based security solutions 
our non triton solutions include our legacy web filtering products  such as our websense web filter  web security suite  server based e mail security and related hardware 
our appliance billings increased from million in to million in we expect the proportion of billings from our triton solutions to continue to increase as a percentage of total billings in annual report 
table of contents billings from incremental sales  which includes product purchases by new customers and purchase of additional products or upgrades by existing customers  increased from million in to million in  which was driven by increased sales of our triton solution products 
our international billings to end user customers represented million  or of our total billings  for compared with million  or of total billings  for the average annual value of each subscription sold during was approximately  compared with approximately  during  reflecting increased sales of our triton security solutions  including our triton security gateways and related appliances  our data loss prevention products and saas offerings to larger enterprise customers 
our average contract duration increased from months for to months for  with approximately of our billings in month contracts  in month contracts and in contracts with durations of months or more 
in addition  the number of transactions valued at over  increased year over year  from transactions in to transactions in we expect our billings to grow in relative to billings as existing web and email filtering customers migrate to our triton solutions  existing triton customers expand their commitment with additional triton functionality and new customers adopt our triton solutions 
our billings depend in part on the number of subscriptions up for renewal each quarter and are affected by cyclical variations  with the fourth quarter generally being our strongest quarter in billings  and the first quarter generally being our lowest quarter in billings each fiscal year 
as a trend  the percentage of billings from subscriptions to our triton content security solutions  including those pre installed on appliances  is increasing and the percentage of billings from our legacy web filtering products is declining 
during  we completed a global restructuring of our international distribution operations 
the restructuring became effective in january  and we anticipate that it will reduce the complexity and compliance risks associated with our global distribution activities 
we expect that the restructuring will also reduce our gaap effective tax rate relative to the gaap effective tax rate that would have applied absent the restructuring because we expect to reduce our taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions with high tax rates and expect to increase our taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction with a lower tax rate where we streamlined and consolidated the ownership of our intellectual property and distribution rights 
the restructuring did not materially impact our us business operations or the relative amount of taxable income in the us versus outside the us while we anticipate that our gaap effective tax rate will be lower than it would have been without the restructuring  we cannot predict whether the gaap effective tax rate in any particular period will be less than the gaap effective tax rate in the immediately preceding prior period or in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 
the actual impact of the restructuring on our gaap effective tax rate is highly dependent on our future results of operations  including the jurisdictions where our revenue is generated 
in october  we closed our acquisition of surfcontrol and as a result incurred a net loss under gaap during the fourth quarter of and for fiscal years  and similar to websense  surfcontrol sold products primarily under subscriptions whereby revenues were recorded ratably over the term of the agreement 
under purchase accounting  we wrote off million of the deferred revenue of surfcontrol  leaving a balance of million 
this adjustment reflected the fair value of the post contract technical support services that is recognized daily in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
in connection with the acquisition  we incurred restructuring costs primarily in connection with reducing surfcontrol headcount and eliminating redundant facilities 
as of the acquisition date  we also immediately started to incur the expenses of operating the surfcontrol operations as well as recording the amortization of the acquired intangibles 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time the estimate is made 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related annual report 
table of contents accounting estimates and disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenues are derived from software and saas products sold on a subscription basis 
a subscription is generally  or months in duration and for a fixed number of seats 
we recognize revenues for the software and saas subscriptions  including any related technical support and professional services  on a daily straight line basis  commencing on the date the term of the subscription begins  and continuing over the term of the subscription agreement  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
upon entering into a subscription arrangement for a fixed or determinable fee  we electronically deliver software access codes to users and then promptly invoice customers for the full amount of their subscriptions 
payment is due for the full term of the subscription  generally within to days of the invoice date 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance any tangible products containing software components and non software components that operate together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
in addition  the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple element revenue arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate elements  and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration to each element based on a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we adopted the amended standards as of january  on a prospective basis for transactions entered into or materially modified after december  a portion of our revenues are generated from the sale of appliances  which are standard server platforms optimized for our software products 
these appliances contain software components  such as operating systems  that operate together with the hardware platform to provide the essential functionality of the appliance 
based on the amended accounting standards  when sold in a multiple element arrangement that includes software deliverables  our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables and are no longer accounted for under the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
when appliance orders are taken  we ship the product  invoice the customer and recognize revenues when title risk of loss passes to the buyer typically upon delivery to a common carrier and the other criteria of revenue recognition are met 
the revenues recognized are based upon besp  as outlined further below 
for transactions entered into prior to the adoption of the amended revenue standards on january   all elements in a multiple element arrangement containing software were treated as a single unit of accounting as we did not have adequate support for vsoe of undelivered elements 
as a result  we deferred revenue on our multiple element arrangements until only the post contract customer support database updates and technical support or other services not essential to the functionality of the software remained undelivered 
at that point  the revenue was amortized over the remaining life of the software subscription or estimated delivery term of the services  whichever was longer 
for transactions entered into subsequent to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition standards that are multiple element arrangements  we allocate the arrangement fee to the software related elements and the non software related elements based upon the relative selling price of such element 
when applying the relative annual report 
table of contents selling price method  we determine the selling price for each element using besp  because vsoe and tpe are not available 
the revenues allocated to the software related elements are recognized based on the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance that remains unchanged 
the revenues allocated to the non software related elements are recognized based on the nature of the element provided the fee is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and collectability is reasonably assured 
the manner in which we account for multiple element arrangements that contain only software and software related elements remains unchanged 
we determine besp for an individual element within a multiple element revenue arrangement using the same methods utilized to determine the selling price of an element sold on a standalone basis 
we estimate the selling price by considering internal factors such as historical pricing practices and gross margin objectives 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies  customer demands and geography 
as there is a significant amount of judgment when determining besp  we regularly review all of our assumptions and inputs around besp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
during  we recognized million in revenues from appliance sales  of which million represented the immediate recognition of revenue upon shipment and the remaining million represented primarily the ratable recognition of deferred revenue from appliance sales recorded prior to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition rules 
in we expect to recognize revenues of million from appliance sales made prior to that are recorded in deferred revenue as of december  had we not adopted the amended revenue recognition rules  the amount of revenues recognized from appliance sales would have been approximately million for the new accounting guidance for revenue recognition is expected to continue to affect total revenues in future periods  although the impact on the timing and pattern of revenues will vary depending on the nature and volume of new or materially modified contracts in any given period 
for our oem contracts  we grant our oem customers the right to incorporate our products into the oems products or services for resale to end users 
the oem customer generally pays us a royalty fee for each resale of our product to an end user over a specified period of time 
we recognize revenues associated with the oem contracts ratably over the contractual period for which we are obligated to provide our services to the oem 
the time period over which we recognize revenue associated with oem contracts is determined by the contractual obligation period and will vary for each oem depending on the information available  such as underlying end user subscription periods 
to the extent we provide any custom software and engineering services in connection with an oem arrangement  we defer recognition of all revenue until acceptance of the custom software 
we record distributor marketing payments and channel rebates as an offset to revenues  unless we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration and we can estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
we recognize distributor marketing payments as an offset to revenues in the period the marketing service is provided and we recognize channel rebates as an offset to revenues generally on a straight line basis over the term of the underlying subscription sale 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves for tax contingencies are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with prevailing law and practice 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of these reserves and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
annual report 
table of contents deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction  the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
during the first quarter of  we were informed by the irs that they had completed their audit for the tax years ended december  through december  accordingly  the irs issued us a day letter which outlined all of their proposed audit adjustments and required us to either accept the proposed adjustments  subject to future litigation  or file a formal administrative protest contesting those proposed adjustments within days 
the proposed adjustments relate primarily to the cost sharing arrangement between websense  inc and our irish subsidiary  including the amount of cost sharing buy in  as well as to our claim of research and development tax credits and income tax deductions for equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the amount of additional tax proposed by the irs totals approximately million  of which million relates to the amount of cost sharing buy in  million relates to research and development credits and million relates to equity compensation awarded to certain executive officers 
the total additional tax proposed excludes interest  penalties and state income taxes  each of which may be significant  and also excludes a potential reduction in tax on the irish subsidiary 
the proposed adjustments also do not include the future impact that changes in our cost sharing arrangement could have on our effective tax rate 
we disagree with all of the proposed adjustments and have submitted a formal protest to the irs for each matter 
the irs assigned our case to an irs appeals officer and the appeals process commenced during the second quarter of in the third quarter of  the irs withdrew the proposed adjustment relating to equity compensation of million  resulting in no additional tax liability 
this reduced the amount of the additional tax proposed by the irs for the tax years ended december  through december  to approximately million 
we intend to continue to defend our position on the remaining matters at the irs appeals office  including through litigation if required 
the timing of the ultimate resolution of these remaining matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time and the appeals process is still ongoing as of the date of this report  february  acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting  in accordance with gaap accounting rules for business combinations  which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
we review goodwill that has an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually in our fourth fiscal quarter  or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment 
we amortize the cost of identified intangible assets using amortization methods that reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up 
we review for impairment by facts or circumstances  either external or internal  indicating that we may not recover the carrying value of the asset 
we measure impairment losses related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values 
we measure fair value generally based on the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset 
our analysis is based on available information and on assumptions and projections that we consider to be reasonable and supportable 
if necessary  we perform subsequent calculations to measure the amount of the impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
annual report 
table of contents share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation under the fair value method 
share based compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchase plan share grants is recorded based on the fair value of the award on its grant date 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes valuation model 
share based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
performance based restricted stock units have performance based vesting components that vest only if performance criteria are met for each respective performance period 
if the performance criteria are not met for a performance period  then the related performance awards that would have vested are forfeited 
certain performance criteria allow for different vested amounts based on the level of achievement of the performance criteria 
once the performance based vesting criteria is met  the awards are then subject to time based vesting 
fair value has been measured on the grant date and is recognized over the expected vesting period  provided we determine it is probable that the performance criteria will be met 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans excluding tax effects 
that total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for estimated forfeitures as well as for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions described below 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the history of grants and exercises in our option database 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both the historical volatility as well as the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock 
we base the risk free interest rate that is used in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
we amortize the fair value ratably over the vesting period of the awards 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future or select a different option valuation model altogether  which could materially affect our results of operations in the future 
we determine the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
allowance for doubtful accounts and other loss contingencies 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or unwillingness of our customers to pay their invoices 
we establish this allowance using estimates that we make based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  changes to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and other facts and circumstances of our existing customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make annual report 
table of contents payments  additional allowances may be required 
other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires significant judgment by management based on the facts and circumstances of each matter 
results of operations the following table summarizes our operating results as a percentage of total revenues for each of the periods shown 
years ended december  revenues software and service appliance total revenues cost of revenues software and service appliance total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing research and development general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations interest expense other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues software and service revenues 
software and service revenues increased to million in from million in because we recognize software and service revenues ratably over the term of the subscription  growth in software and service revenues reflect changes in current deferred revenue at the beginning of the period compared with the prior period  as well as the change in current period billings 
the increase in software and service revenues compared with was primarily the result of increased incremental billings to new customers and upgrades to existing customers  as well as higher oem revenues in as compared with software and service revenues generated in the united states accounted for million  or of revenues  compared with million  or in software and service revenues generated internationally accounted for million  or of revenues  compared with million  or  in we had current deferred revenue relating to software and service revenues of million as of december   compared with million as of december   and we had total deferred revenue relating to software and service revenues of million as of december   compared with million as of december  annual report 
table of contents we expect our software and service revenues in to exceed our software and service revenues in due to the increase in current deferred revenue that will be recognized as revenue  subscriptions that are scheduled for renewal that are expected to be renewed and upgraded  and expected new business for which some revenues will be recognized during these trends are anticipated to be partially offset by an expected decline in revenue from oem arrangements 
our software and service revenues are impacted by the average duration of contracts billed  the timing of sales of renewal and new subscriptions  the average annual contract value and per seat price  the volume of oem revenue activity and the effect of currency exchange rates on new and renewal subscriptions in international markets 
appliance revenues 
appliance revenues increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of increased appliance sales in and our adoption of new revenue recognition rules as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements starting january  under which revenues from sales of appliances are generally recognized when sold 
accordingly  million of the revenue recognized in  represented primarily the ratable recognition of deferred revenue for sales of appliances recorded prior to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition rules  and the remaining million represented revenues from sales of appliances sold in as of december   we had million of remaining deferred revenue for sales recorded prior to the adoption of the amended revenue recognition rules 
appliance revenues generated in the united states accounted for million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in appliance revenues generated internationally accounted for million  or of revenues  compared with million  or of revenues  in for  we expect our appliance revenues to decrease in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues as compared with primarily as a result of the decline in deferred revenue to be recognized in from appliance sales recorded prior to january   which is expected to offset projected increases in appliance sales in for  we expect to recognize million of deferred revenue for appliance sales recorded prior to january  cost of revenues software and service cost of revenues 
software and service cost of revenues consists of the costs of web content review  amortization of acquired technology  technical support and infrastructure costs associated with maintaining our databases and costs associated with providing our saas offerings 
software and service cost of revenues decreased to million in from million in the million decrease was primarily due to decreased amortization of acquired technology of million and decreased allocated costs of million  offset by increased personnel costs of million 
amortization of acquired technology was million in compared with million in the decrease of million in amortization of acquired technology from to was primarily due to certain acquired technology being fully amortized in as of december   the remaining acquired technology is being amortized over a remaining weighted average period of years 
we expect to incur million in amortization expense of acquired technology during our full time employee headcount in cost of revenues departments decreased from an average of employees during to an average of employees during  and is expected to remain relatively flat in we allocate the costs for human resources  employee benefits  payroll taxes  it  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of our functional areas based on headcount data 
as a percentage of software and service revenues  software and service cost of revenues was for  compared with for we expect software and service cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars in due to higher expected software and service billings  but remain approximately constant as a percentage of software and service revenues in as compared with appliance cost of revenues 
appliance cost of revenues consists of the costs associated with the sale of our appliance products  primarily the cost of the hardware platform and software installation costs 
appliance cost of revenues increased to million in  from million in as described in the appliance revenues annual report 
table of contents section above  the million increase was primarily due to increased appliance sales in and our adoption of revenue recognition rules under which the related costs are generally recognized when the appliances are sold 
in appliance cost of revenues for  we recognized million of the ratable cost of appliances sold prior to that were recognized in revenues in and the remaining million represents costs of appliances sold in as a percentage of appliance revenues  appliance cost of revenues decreased to in from in we expect appliance cost of revenues will decrease in absolute dollars in as compared with due to the decline in deferred costs to be recognized in from appliance sales recorded prior to january  this decline is expected to be offset by projected increases in appliance sales in during  we expect to recognize million in deferred cost of revenues related to sales recorded prior to january  gross profit gross profit increased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of increased revenues 
as a percentage of total revenues  our gross profit was for both and we expect that gross profit as a percentage of revenue will remain in excess of of revenue for operating expenses selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits related to personnel engaged in selling  marketing and customer support functions  costs related to public relations  advertising  promotions and travel  amortization of acquired customer relationships and other allocated costs 
selling and marketing expenses do not include payments to channel partners for marketing services and rebates as those are recorded as an offset to revenue 
selling and marketing expenses increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues  in the million increase in total selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to increased personnel costs of million resulting from higher average head count and costs associated with changes to our internal sales team during and increased allocated costs of million  partially offset by a reduction in the amortization of acquired intangible assets customer relationships of million 
our headcount in sales and marketing increased from an average of employees during to an average of employees during headcount is expected to increase slightly in we expect overall selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in as compared with primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel to support our expanding selling and marketing efforts worldwide and increased sales commission expenses from higher expected billings  partially offset by a reduction of amortization of acquired intangible assets  compared with  from the surfcontrol acquisition 
we expect selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain relatively constant in compared with if our billings exceed expectations  our sales commission expenses can be expected to exceed our expectations and result in higher than expected selling and marketing expenses in because commission expenses are recognized in the period incurred  while a substantial portion of revenues are recognized in future periods  if our billings exceed expectations  our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase in compared with based on the existing sales and marketing related intangible assets as of december   we expect amortization of sales and marketing related acquired intangibles of million for  which would be a reduction of approximately million from fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact our selling and marketing expenses in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software developers and allocated costs 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues  in the increase of million in research and development expenses was due to increased personnel costs of million and increased allocated costs of million 
although our headcount increased in research and development from an average of annual report 
table of contents employees during to an average of employees during  the impact of the higher headcount was partially mitigated by an increase in the number of employees in relatively low cost foreign locations 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in as compared with due to an expanded base of product offerings and increased average headcount compared with to support our continued enhancements and new product developments 
fluctuations in foreign currencies may also impact our research and development expenses in we are managing the increase in our absolute research and development expenses by operating research and development facilities in multiple international locations  including facilities in beijing  china and ra anana  israel  that have lower costs than our operations in the united states 
we also have research and development facilities in los gatos and san diego  california and reading  england 
we expect that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues will remain relatively flat in compared with general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related expenses for our executive  finance and administrative personnel  third party professional service fees and allocated costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  in from million  or of revenues  in the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in third party professional service fees  which were largely related to the global restructuring of our international distribution operations  and increased personnel costs 
our headcount remained consistent in general and administrative departments with an average of employees during to an average of employees during we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively constant in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in compared with interest expense interest expense decreased to million in compared with million in the decrease was partially due to a lower average outstanding loan balance on our secured loan of million during  compared with an average loan balance of million during in addition  the effective interest rate was lower in compared with primarily due to the expiration of an unfavorable fixed rate swap agreement which expired on september  and more favorable interest rate terms under our credit facility 
also included in the interest expense is amortization of deferred financing fees of million and million for and  respectively  that were capitalized as part of the credit facility and credit facility  as applicable 
our weighted average interest rate was in and is expected to increase to for as a result of an interest rate swap becoming effective on december  our interest expense is expected to increase in as compared with due to a higher weighted average interest rate 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the credit agreement 
other income expense  net other income increased to million in  compared with other expense of million in  reflecting foreign exchange related net gains of million in compared with net losses of million in as a result of movements in the currency exchange rates during and we expect our net other income in will be less than levels because included these foreign exchange related net gains which are expected to be non recurring 
provision for income taxes in  we recognized an income tax expense of million compared with an income tax expense of million for the annual effective income tax rate for was compared with for annual report 
table of contents for  the effective tax rate variance from the us federal statutory rate was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit recognized for the year of approximately million offset partially by the unfavorable impact of foreign withholding taxes and non deductible share based compensation expense 
approximately million of the net tax benefit recognized for the year resulted from our global distribution restructuring which was completed during and became effective in january this amount relates primarily to the non recurring tax effect from the transfer of customer relationship intangible assets and the related deferred tax liabilities from a higher tax rate jurisdiction to a lower tax rate jurisdiction 
this entire tax benefit was recorded in the first quarter of upon completion of our global distribution restructuring and is not expected to recur 
the remaining net tax benefit recognized for the year of approximately million relates to the reversal of previously established reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the settlement of a tax inquiry in the united kingdom in the fourth quarter of this entire net tax benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of  the period in which the settlement occurred  and is not expected to recur 
for  the effective tax rate variance from the us federal statutory rate was primarily related to earnings recognized in lower tax jurisdictions  and the reduction of a valuation allowance related to net operating losses for one of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom  partially offset by the write down of a deferred tax asset relating to the net operating losses in the united kingdom 
our effective tax rate may change in future periods due to differences in the composition of taxable income between domestic and international operations along with the potential changes or interpretations in tax rules and legislation  or corresponding accounting rules 
effective january  we completed a global restructuring of our international distribution operations  which we anticipate will reduce the complexity and compliance risks associated with our global distribution activities 
we expect that the restructuring will also reduce our gaap effective tax rate relative to the gaap effective tax rate that would have applied absent the restructuring because we expect to reduce our taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions having high tax rates and expect to increase our taxable income in a foreign jurisdiction with a lower tax rate where we streamlined and consolidated the ownership of our intellectual property and distribution rights 
the restructuring did not materially impact our us business operations or the relative amount of taxable income in the us versus outside the us while we anticipate that our gaap effective tax rate will be lower than it would have been without the global distribution restructuring  we cannot predict whether the gaap effective tax rate in any particular period will be less than the gaap effective tax rate in the immediately preceding prior period or in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year 
the actual impact of the restructuring on our gaap effective tax rate is highly dependent on our future results of operations  including the jurisdictions where our revenue is generated 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets 
realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon taxable income in prior carryback years  estimates of future taxable income  tax planning strategies and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
based on our assessment of these items for the fiscal year ended december   specifically the expected reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and a history of generating taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the balance of the deferred tax assets currently reflected on our consolidated balance sheets

estimated interest and fees expected to be incurred on the credit facility are based on known rates and scheduled principal payments  as well as the interest rate swap agreement  as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we lease our facilities under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through approximately of our operating lease commitments are related to our corporate headquarters lease in san diego which has escalating rent payments from to the san diego lease expires in december  however  we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years 
the rent expense related to our worldwide office space leases are generally recorded monthly on a straight line basis in accordance with gaap

therefore  million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements have been excluded from the contractual payment obligations table above 
in april  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to four million shares of our common stock 
in august  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional four million shares  for a total program size of up to eight million shares 
in july  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional four million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in january  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional four million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
in october  we announced that our board of directors increased the size of the stock repurchase program by an additional eight million shares  for a total program size of up to million shares 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date  does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time by our board of directors 
in connection with the stock repurchase program  we adopted the repurchase plans in august the repurchase plans initially provided for purchases of up to an aggregate of million of our common stock per calendar quarter in open market transactions beginning in october in november  we increased the value of shares to be repurchased under the repurchase plans from an aggregate of million to million per calendar quarter  effective as of january  in october  we decreased the value of shares to be repurchased under the repurchase plans from an aggregate of million to annual report 
table of contents million per calendar quarter effective as of january  repurchases are made on the open market at prevailing market prices in accordance with timing conditions set forth in the repurchase plans 
depending on market conditions and other factors  including compliance with covenants in the credit agreement  purchases by our agents under the repurchase plans may be suspended at any time  or from time to time 
the repurchase plans will expire on november   unless they are further extended by amendment 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate of approximately million at an average price of per share 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock under this stock repurchase program  for an aggregate of million at an average price of per share 
the credit agreement permits us to repurchase our securities so long as we are not in default under the credit agreement  have complied with all of our financial covenants  and have liquidity of at least million  provided  however  if  after giving effect to any repurchase  our leverage ratio is greater than  such repurchase cannot exceed million in the aggregate in any fiscal year 
as of december   there are  shares available for purchase under the plan and we intend to continue repurchasing shares during we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balances  accounts receivable  revolving credit balances and our ongoing cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  including our capital expenditures  debt repayment obligations and stock repurchases  if any  for at least the next months 
during  we borrowed a net total of million on our secured loan and repurchased approximately million of our common stock 
our cash requirements may increase for reasons we do not currently foresee or we may make acquisitions as part of our growth strategy that increase our cash requirements 
we may elect to borrow under the credit agreement  raise funds for these purposes or reduce our cost of capital through capital markets transactions or debt or private equity transactions as appropriate 
we intend to continue to invest our cash in excess of current operating and capital requirements in interest bearing  investment grade money market funds 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and the credit facility 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments such as money market funds 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and the interest expense incurred on our secured loan and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our money market funds and from our borrowings at variable rates under the credit facility 
in connection with the credit agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest per annum and receive a floating rate interest payment based on the three month libor on a principal amount of million 
the million swap agreement became effective on december  and expires on october  a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would materially affect our interest expense 
however  the impact of this type of adverse movement would be partially mitigated by our interest rate swap agreement that became effective on december  based on our revolving credit balance at december  and taking into consideration our interest rate swap agreement  our interest expense would increase on a pre tax basis by approximately million during the next months if a basis point adverse move in the interest rate yield curve occurred 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive investments at december  changes in interest rates over time will  however  affect our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we sell our products through a distribution network in approximately countries  and we bill certain international customers in euros  british pounds  australian dollars and chinese renminbi 
additionally  a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we sell our products 
to mitigate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates  we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and expenses 
we also keep working funds necessary to facilitate the short term operations of our subsidiaries in the local currencies in which they do business 
as exchange rate fluctuations can significantly vary our sales and expense results when converted to us dollars  our objective is to reduce the risk to earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes

all of the euro hedging contracts in place on december  are scheduled to be settled before june for and  less than and  respectively  of our total billings were denominated in the euro 
we expect euro billings to represent less than of our total billings during the million notional decrease in our british pound hedge position at december  compared with december  was due to having no british pound hedging contracts in place as of december  for and  less than of our total billings were denominated in the british pound 
we expect british pound billings to represent less than of our total billings during we had no australian dollar or chinese renminbi hedging contracts in place as of december  or a significant portion of our foreign subsidiaries operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies so if the us dollar weakens  our consolidated operating expenses would increase 
should the us dollar strengthen  our products may become more expensive for our international customers with subscription contracts denominated in us dollars 
changes in currency rates also impact our future revenues under subscription contracts that are not denominated in us dollars 
our revenues and deferred revenue for these foreign currencies are recorded in us dollars when the subscription is entered into based upon currency exchange rates in effect on the last day of the previous month before the subscription agreement is entered into 
we engage in currency hedging activities with the intent of limiting the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  but our foreign exchange hedging activities also involve inherent risks that could result in an unforeseen loss
