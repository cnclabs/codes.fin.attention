eesa also increased fdic deposit insurance on most accounts from  to  this increase was in place until december   and has since been made permanent by the dodd frank act 
temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the fdic established a temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on october  the tlgp includes the transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage through december  for noninterest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts and certain funds swept into noninterest bearing savings accounts 
institutions participating in the tagp pay a basis points fee annualized on the balance of each covered account in excess of  while the extra deposit insurance is in place 
the tlgp also includes the debt guarantee program dgp  under which the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of fdic insured institutions and their holding companies 
the unsecured debt must be issued on or after october  and not later than october   and the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or june  the dgp coverage limit is generally of the eligible entity s eligible debt outstanding on september  and scheduled to mature on or before june  or  for certain insured institutions  of their liabilities as of september  depending on the term of the debt maturity  the nonrefundable dgp fee ranges from to basis points annualized for covered debt outstanding until the earlier of maturity or june  the tagp and dgp are in effect for all eligible entities  unless the entity opted out on or before december  first financial service corporation s bank subsidiary elected to participate in the tagp and both the bank subsidiary and the holding company are eligible to participate in dgp 
certificate of deposit account registry service 
to mitigate the risks associated with carrying balances in excess of federally insured limits  we are participating in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
cdars is a system that allows certificates of deposit that would be in excess of fdic coverage in a single financial institution to be redistributed to other financial institutions within the cdars network in increments under the current fdic coverage limit 
consequently  the full amount of the certificates of deposit becomes eligible for fdic protection 
even though we have deposits that will remain in the cdars network  those deposits are considered brokered deposits and the bank s troubled institution designation prevents us from accepting  renewing or rolling over brokered deposits 
therefore  as long as the consent order remains in effect  we will be able to retain only our deposits within the cdars network that do not come up for renewal or roll over 
american recovery and reinvestment act 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future cpp recipients  including the corporation  until the institution has repaid the treasury 
arra also permits cpp participants to redeem the preferred shares held by the treasury department without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
we have not redeemed any of the preferred shares we issued to the treasury 
dodd frank act 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act was signed into law on july  the dodd frank act is intended to affect a fundamental restructuring of federal banking regulation 
among other things  the dodd frank act creates a new financial stability oversight council to identify systemic risks in the financial system and gives federal regulators new authority to take control of and liquidate financial firms 
the dodd frank act additionally creates a new independent federal regulator to administer federal consumer protection laws 

table of contents it is difficult to predict at this time what impact the new legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks like the bank  including the lending and credit practices of such banks 
moreover  many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will not take effect for several months  and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those provisions relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau will increase our operating and compliance costs and restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the dodd frank act is expected to have a significant impact on the corporation s business operations as its provisions take effect 
among the provisions that affect the corporation are the following corporate governance 
the dodd frank act requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so called golden parachute payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions 
the new legislation also authorizes the sec to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
additionally  the dodd frank act directs the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of billion  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
the dodd frank act gives the sec authority to prohibit broker discretionary voting on elections of directors and executive compensation matters 
transactions with affiliates and insiders 
the dodd frank act applies section a and section h of the federal reserve act governing transactions with insiders to derivative transactions  repurchase agreements and securities lending and borrowing transactions that create credit exposure to an affiliate or an insider 
any such transactions with affiliates must be fully secured 
the current exemption from section a for transactions with financial subsidiaries is eliminated 
the dodd frank act additionally prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing an asset from or selling an asset to an insider unless the transaction is on market terms and  if representing more than of capital  is approved in advance by the disinterested directors 
consumer financial protection bureau 
the dodd frank act creates a new  independent federal agency called the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb  which is granted broad rulemaking  supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws  including the ecoa  tila  respa  fcra  fair debt collection act  the consumer financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act glba and certain other statutes 
the cfpb has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with billion or more in assets 
smaller institutions will be subject to rules promulgated by the cfpb  but will continue to be examined and supervised by federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes 
the cfpb has authority to prevent unfair  deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products 
the dodd frank act authorizes the cfpb to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower s ability to repay 
in addition  the dodd frank act will allow borrowers to raise certain defenses to foreclosure if they receive any loan other than a qualified mortgage as defined by the cfpb 
the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and  in certain circumstances  permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations 
federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements  traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter  has also been modified by the dodd frank act and now requires a case by case determination of preemption by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank 
depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard  the operations of the bank could become subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates 

table of contents deposit insurance 
the dodd frank act permanently increases the maximum deposit insurance amount for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and extends unlimited deposit insurance to non interest bearing transaction accounts through december  the dodd frank act also broadens the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act requires the fdic to increase the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund from to of insured deposits by and eliminates the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
the dodd frank act also eliminates the federal statutory prohibition against the payment of interest on business checking accounts 
capital 
under the dodd frank act  the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may  by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than billion of assets 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
uncertainty remains as to ultimate impact of the dodd frank act  but the board and management anticipates that the provisions summarized above  as well as others set forth in the dodd frank act  could have an adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and our business  results of operations and financial condition

risk factors the risks identified below  as well as in the other cautionary statements made throughout this report  identify factors that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and or operating results 
if we continue to incur significant losses  it may be difficult to continue to operate 
we recorded a net loss to common shareholders of million in  a net loss to common shareholders of million in and a net loss to common shareholders of million in  for a three year total of million 
the net loss for was due in part to provision for loan losses of million and write downs on other real estate owned of million 
the net loss for was due in part to a million deferred tax valuation allowance and the net loss for was due in part to an million non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge 
during  and  we recorded total provisions for loan losses of million  total write downs on other real estate owned of million and other than temporary impairment losses on investments of million 
while our losses also included a charge off of goodwill of million  and a charge to establish an allowance against the realization of our deferred tax asset of million  these latter charges were largely influenced by the losses on loans and investments 
we could be required to make additional provisions for loan losses and impairments to investments if asset values continue to decline in the current economic climate 
this in turn may require the corporation to raise additional capital to fund the bank s operations so that the bank can sustain such losses and attain compliance with the minimum capital levels set forth in the consent order 
see part i  item business regulatory matters recent developments  for a description of the bank s capital requirements set forth in the consent order 
we are subject to a consent order with the fdic and kdfi and a formal agreement with the federal reserve that restrict the conduct of our operations and may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our good standing with bank regulatory agencies is of fundamental importance to the continuation of our businesses 
in january  the bank agreed to a consent order by the fdic and kdfi by which the bank agreed to develop and implement actions to reduce the amount of classified assets and improve earnings 
the bank agreed to a new consent order with the fdic and the kdfi on march  any material failures to comply with the consent order would likely result in more stringent enforcement actions by the fdic and kdfi  which could damage the reputation of the bank and have a material adverse effect on our business 
the provisions of each of the consent orders are outlined above in the regulatory matters recent developments section 
compliance with the consent order will increase our operating expense  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
current federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized banks 
under this system  the fdic has established three undercapitalized categories undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  and it is required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions  and is authorized to take other discretionary actions  with respect to banks in one of the three undercapitalized categories 
the severity of any actions taken will depend upon the capital category in which a bank is placed 
generally  subject to a narrow exception  current federal law requires the fdic to appoint a receiver or conservator for a bank that is critically undercapitalized 
a bank that has a tangible equity capital to average total assets ratio equal to or less than is deemed to be critically undercapitalized 
the bank s actual tangible equity capital to average total assets ratio at december  is 
in april  the corporation entered into a formal agreement with the federal reserve bank of st 
louis  which requires the corporation to obtain regulatory approval before declaring any dividends 
we also may not redeem shares or obtain additional borrowings without prior approval 
any material failures to comply with the formal agreement would likely result in more stringent enforcement actions by the federal reserve which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our ability to pay cash dividends on our common and preferred stock and pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures that relate to our trust preferred securities is currently restricted 
our inability to resume paying dividends and distributions on these securities may adversely affect our common shareholders 
we historically paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock until we suspended dividend payments in december during the third quarter of  we also suspended cash dividends on the treasury preferred stock and have begun deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes relating to our trust preferred securities 
deferring interest payments on the junior subordinated notes will result in a deferral of distributions on our trust preferred securities 
future payment of cash dividends on our common stock and future payment on treasury preferred stock will be subject to the prior payment of all unpaid dividends on the treasury preferred stock and all deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities 
if we miss six quarterly dividend payments on the treasury preferred stock  whether or not consecutive  the treasury department will have the right to appoint two directors to our board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid 
dividends on the treasury preferred stock and deferred distributions on our trust preferred securities are cumulative and therefore unpaid dividends and distributions will accrue and compound on each subsequent payment date 
if we become subject to any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of affairs  holders of the trust preferred securities and then holders of the preferred stock will be entitled to receive the liquidation amounts to which they are entitled including the amount of any accrued and unpaid distributions and dividends  before any distribution to the holders of common stock 
we need to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when needed or at all 
the bank has agreed with the fdic and the kdfi to develop a plan to increase its tier one leverage ratio to and its total capital as a percentage of risk weighted assets to 
we are evaluating various specific initiatives to increase our regulatory capital and to reduce our total assets 
strategic alternatives include divesting of branch offices  selling loans and raising capital by selling stock 
as part of our ongoing capital initiatives  on february   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our four indiana banking centers to first savings bank  fsb  the banking subsidiary of first savings financial group  inc this transaction is projected to increase our tier i capital ratio from to and increase our total risk based capital ratio from to based on information at december   and is expected to close early in the third quarter of our ability to raise additional capital will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
we may not have access to capital on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
future sales of our common stock or other securities will dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders and could depress the market price of our common stock 
we are currently evaluating strategies to meet our capital needs and regulatory requirements 
these strategies may result in the issuance of additional common shares 
we can issue common shares without shareholder approval  up to the number of authorized shares set forth in our articles of incorporation 
our board of directors may determine to seek additional capital through the issuance and sale of common shares  preferred shares or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares  subject to limitations imposed by the nasdaq stock market and the federal reserve 
we may not be able to issue common shares at prices or on terms better than or equal to the prices and terms on which our current shareholders acquired their shares 
our future issuance of any additional common shares or other securities may have the effect of reducing the book value or market price of then outstanding common shares 
our issuance of additional common or securities convertible into or exercisable for common shares will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of our existing shareholders 
in addition  if our shareholders sell a substantial number of our common shares or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common shares in the public market  or if there is a perception that such sales are likely to occur  it could cause the market price of our common shares to continue declining 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that either future sales of a substantial volume of our common shares in the market  or the 
table of contents potential for large volumes of sales in the market  would have on the market price of our common shares 
however  if the market price of our common shares declines  it could impair our ability to raise capital through sales of stock 
we cannot guarantee whether such financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain future financing  we may not have the capital and financial resources needed to operate our business or to meet regulatory requirements 
ongoing market developments may continue to adversely affect our industry  businesses and results of operations 
since mid  the financial services industry as a whole has been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
concerns about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties have caused many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers including financial institutions 
the lack of available credit  loss of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity have materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects that these difficult market conditions have had on us and others in the financial services industry 
sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in our markets has had and could continue to have the following adverse effects on our business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services that we offer  a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate  an impairment of certain intangible assets  an increase in the number of clients who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
higher numbers of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults have resulted in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
overall  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business in recent years  and there can be no assurance that the environment will improve in the near term 
until conditions improve  we expect our businesses  financial condition and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected 
if we cannot borrow funds through access to the capital markets  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  or meet the operating cash needs of the corporation 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
if our liquidity policies and strategies don t work as well as intended  then we may be unable to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
our asset liability committee follows established board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify our wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
wholesale funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core brokered deposits  and medium and long term debt  which includes federal home loan bank advances that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
as long as the consent order remains in effect  the bank will not be able to rely on brokered deposits including deposits through the cdars program for its liquidity needs 
the designation of the bank as a troubled institution in connection with the issuance of the consent order prohibits the bank from accepting new brokered deposits or renewing or rolling over any existing brokered deposits at the bank 
the bank is 
table of contents also restricted in the amount of interest it may pay on core deposits 
see part i  item i business regulation regulatory capital requirements for a description of the bank s interest rate restrictions 
the bank s designation as a troubled institution may also limit the amount of additional advances available from the fhlb 
the bank currently has sufficient collateral to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
the corporation is a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank 
historically  the corporation has received substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from the bank 
regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us 
recent losses have had the consequence of not allowing the bank to pay any dividends to the corporation without prior regulatory approval 
the corporation has no other sources of revenue 
at december  the corporation had liquidity in the form of cash of  we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other available sources of liquidity  including the sale or securitization of loans  the ability to acquire additional non core brokered deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as fhlb advances  the issuance of debt securities  and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might not be able to meet the needs of our customers  which could adversely impact our financial condition  our results of operations  cash flows  and our level of regulatory qualifying capital 
for further discussion  see the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our decisions regarding credit risk may not be accurate  and our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level we believe is adequate to absorb any probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio based on historical loan loss experience  specific problem loans  value of underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
if our assessment of these factors is ultimately inaccurate  the allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which would require us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results 
our estimates are subjective and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events 
changes in economic  operating and other conditions that are generally beyond our control could cause the financial condition of our borrowers to deteriorate and our actual loan losses to increase significantly 
bank regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their supervisory functions  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
regulatory agencies have required us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs when their judgment has differed from ours  and they may do so in the future  which could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our relatively high concentration of loans collateralized by real estate 
approximately of our loan portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans collateralized by real estate 
an adverse change in the economy that depresses values of real estate generally or in our primary markets such as we have recently experienced could significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
when real estate values decline  it becomes more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses as we did in  and if during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses  it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments  financial performance and capital 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our investment portfolio periodically for the presence of other than temporary impairment of our securities  taking into consideration current market conditions  the extent and nature of change in fair value  issuer rating changes and trends  
table of contents volatility of earnings  current analysts evaluations  our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value  as well as other factors 
adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other than temporarily impaired  with the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to earnings 
recent market volatility has made it extremely difficult to value certain securities 
subsequent valuations  in light of factors prevailing at that time  may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods 
any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
because most of our business activities are conducted in central kentucky and adjacent counties of indiana  and most of our credit exposure is in that region  we are at risk from adverse economic or business developments affecting this area  including declining regional and local business activity  a downturn in real estate values and agricultural activities and natural disasters 
to the extent the central kentucky economy further declines  the rates of delinquencies  foreclosures  bankruptcies and losses in our loan portfolio would likely increase 
moreover  the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be adversely affected by economic downturn or a localized natural disaster 
an economic downturn or other events that affect our markets could  therefore  result in losses that may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our small to medium sized business target market may have fewer resources to weather the downturn in the economy 
our strategy includes lending to small and medium sized businesses and other commercial enterprises 
small and medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial variations in operating results  any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan 
in addition  the success of a small and medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay our loan 
economic downturns and other events could have a more pronounced negative impact on our target market  which could cause us to incur substantial credit losses that could materially harm our operating results 
our profitability is vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
factors beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  unemployment  and money supply may also affect interest rates 
if our interest earning assets mature or re price more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities in a given period  as a result of decreasing interest rates  our net interest income may decrease 
likewise  our net interest income may decrease if interest bearing liabilities mature or re price more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates 
fixed rate loans increase our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to re pricing before assets become subject to re pricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks  such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
in the current low interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates  which could reduce net interest income and harm our results of operations 

table of contents we face strong competition from other financial institutions and financial service companies  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with other financial institutions in attracting deposits and making loans 
our competition in attracting deposits comes principally from commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds 
competition in making loans in the louisville metropolitan area has increased in recent years after changes in banking law allowed several banks to enter the market by establishing new branches 
likewise  competition is increasing in our other markets  which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our market share 
competition in the banking industry may also limit our ability to attract and retain banking clients 
we maintain smaller staffs of associates and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which we compete 
financial institutions that have far greater resources and greater efficiencies than we do may have several marketplace advantages resulting from their ability to offer higher interest rates on deposits and lower interest rates on loans than we can  offer a broader range of services than we do  maintain numerous branch locations  and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
in addition  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and other financial intermediaries may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are and may have larger lending limits than we do 
some of our current commercial banking clients may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than we can accommodate 
if we are unable to attract and retain customers  we may not be able to maintain growth and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and  as a result  are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to implement our growth and operating strategies 
we are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies  which is described under item business regulation 
regulatory oversight of banks is primarily intended to protect depositors  the federal deposit insurance funds  and the banking system as a whole  not our shareholders 
compliance with these regulations is costly and may make it more difficult to operate profitably 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern numerous matters including the payment of dividends  the acquisition of other banks and the establishment of new banking offices 
we must also meet specific regulatory capital requirements 
our failure to comply with these laws  regulations and policies or to maintain our capital requirements affects our ability to pay dividends on common stock  our ability to grow through the development of new offices and our ability to make acquisitions 
we currently may not pay a dividend from the bank to the corporation without the prior written consent of our primary banking regulators  which limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
these limitations may also prevent us from successfully implementing our growth and operating strategies 
in addition  the laws and regulations applicable to banks could change at any time  which could significantly impact our business and profitability 
for example  new legislation or regulation could limit the manner in which we may conduct our business  including our ability to attract deposits and make loans 
events that may not have a direct impact on us  such as the bankruptcy or insolvency of a prominent us corporation  can cause legislators and banking regulators and other agencies such as the financial accounting standards board  the sec  the public company accounting oversight board  the consumer financial protection bureau and various taxing authorities to respond by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations  or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
changes in regulation may cause us to devote substantial additional financial resources and management time to compliance  which may negatively affect our operating results 

table of contents recent financial reform legislation could have a material effect on our future operations 
the recently enacted dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act institutes a wide range of reforms that will have an impact on all financial institutions 
the dodd frank act changes the deposit insurance and financial regulatory systems  enhances bank capital requirements and requires new regulations to protect consumers in financial transactions  among other things 
many of these provisions require rule making and studies that will be conducted in the future 
for these reasons  we cannot assess the impact the dodd frank act may have on us at the present time 
our issuance of securities to the us department of the treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares 
in addition  the dividend rate increases substantially after five years if we cannot redeem the shares by that time 
on january   as part of the capital purchase program established by the us department of the treasury under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  we sold million of senior preferred stock to the department of the treasury 
we also issued to the department of the treasury a warrant to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at per share 
the terms of the transaction with the department of the treasury limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares 
for three years after issuance or until the department of the treasury no longer holds any preferred shares  we will not be able to increase our dividends above the most recent level before october  
per common share on a quarterly basis nor repurchase any of our shares without the department of the treasury s approval with limited exceptions  most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans 
also  we will not be able to pay any dividends at all unless we are current on our dividend payments on the preferred shares 
these restrictions  as well as the dilutive impact of the warrant  may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
unless we are able to redeem the preferred stock during the first five years  the dividends on this capital will increase substantially at that point  from approximately million annually to approximately million annually 
depending on market conditions and our financial performance at the time  this increase in dividends could significantly impact our capital and liquidity 
the us department of the treasury has the unilateral ability to change some of the restrictions imposed on us by virtue of our sale of securities to it 
our agreement with the us department of the treasury under which it purchased our securities imposes restrictions on our conduct of our business  including restrictions related to our payment of dividends and repurchase of our stock and related to our executive compensation and governance 
the us department of the treasury has the right under this agreement to unilaterally amend it to the extent required to comply with any future changes in federal statutes 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of amended provisions of eesa relating to compensation and governance as they affect companies that have sold securities to the us department of the treasury 
these amendments could have an adverse impact on the conduct of our business  as could additional amendments in the future that impose further requirements or amend existing requirements 
the federal reserve bank s frb s rule to repeal the prohibition against payment of interest on demand deposits may increase competition for such deposits and ultimately increase interest expense 
on july   the frb s rule to repeal of regulation q  which prohibited the payment of interest on demand deposits by institutions that are member banks of the federal reserve system  went into effect 
the rule implements section of the reform act  which repeals section i of the federal reserve act in its entirety 
as a result  banks and thrifts are now permitted to offer interest bearing demand deposit accounts to commercial customers  which were previously forbidden under regulation q 
the repeal of regulation q may cause increased competition from other financial institutions for these deposits 
if the bank decides to pay interest on demand accounts  it would expect interest expense to increase 
downgrades of the current aa credit rating assigned to us government could adversely affect the bank 
on august   standard poor s lowered the long term sovereign credit rating assigned to the united states from aaa to aa with a negative outlook  indicating a further rating downgrade is possible in the future 
on august   moody s investors service confirmed its aaa rating for the 
table of contents united states with a negative outlook 
fitch ratings has announced that it expects to complete a review of its aaa rating for the united states by the end of august and has not ruled out assigning the rating a negative outlook 
on august   the fdic  federal reserve  occ and national credit union administration issued a joint press release stating that for risk based capital purposes  the risk weights assigned to securities issued or guaranteed by the us government  its agencies and us government sponsored entities will not change 
however  a downgrade of the us government s sovereign credit rating below aa could cause a higher risk weight to be assigned to securities issued or guaranteed by the u 
s government or its agencies that we hold in our portfolio and increase our risk based capital requirements 
in addition  a ratings downgrade of securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or its agencies held in our portfolio could adversely affect the carrying value of such securities 
at this time  we cannot assess the likelihood or severity of such a downgrade or the potential consequences it may have on either the capital position or investment portfolio of the bank and corporation 
while management continually monitors and improves our system of internal controls  data processing systems  and corporate wide processes and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses from operational risk in the future 
management maintains internal operational controls and we have invested in technology to help us process large volumes of transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions 
if our systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected  if our systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner  or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls  significant losses could occur 
we process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operation risk  which could cause us to incur substantial losses 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk 
while not foolproof  these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate  cost effective levels 
we have also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics  and business practices are followed 
nevertheless  we experience loss from operational risk from time to time  including the effects of operational errors  and these losses may be substantial

table of contents item managements s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of our balance sheets and statements of operations 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview the unfavorable economic conditions that have persisted since continued to impact the banking industry and our performance during we have adjusted our policies  procedures and allocated additional resources to address credit quality 
our loan policy has been revised to support our focus on reducing our concentration in real estate and our focus to diversify lending 
we established a board loan committee to meet weekly to address loan approvals and renewals  loan workout situations and the disposal of large other real estate owned assets 
we also added personnel to concentrate on working with struggling borrowers  work on more efficient asset resolutions  and strengthen the management of other real estate owned 
a new appraisal policy was implemented regarding management procedures surrounding the appraisal process 
in accordance with our credit management processes  we obtain new appraisals on properties securing our non performing commercial real estate loans and use those appraisals to determine specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses 
as we receive new appraisals on properties securing non performing loans  we recognize charge offs and adjust specific reserves as appropriate 
our decline in credit quality impacted our results during in the areas of net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  non interest expense  and reversals of tax benefits 
our net loss attributable to common shareholders for was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in the results include provision for loans losses of million  write downs and losses on other real estate owned of million  an increase in fdic insurance expense of  and other than temporary securities impairment of  our credit quality metrics are unfavorable due to the elevated level of non performing assets on our balance sheet 
we experienced improvement in our credit quality metrics during the fourth quarter of as well as indications that credit quality may be stabilizing 
compared to september   we saw a decline in non performing loans of  a decline in non performing assets of and a decline in classified assets of 
we also have sales contracts in place on eleven other real estate owned properties totaling million set to close during the first quarter of indicating continued improvement in classified credits 
our non performing assets are largely comprised of residential housing development assets  building lots  an office building and strip centers primarily located in jefferson and oldham counties 
non performing assets were million or of total assets compared to million or of total assets at december  during  we have had substantially all of our non performing assets appraised or reappraised  including our high end residential development loans and related other real estate owned 
the lower values on the appraisals and reviews of properties appraised within the past year contributed to million in provision expense and million in write downs on other real estate owned recorded for the year 
we believe that we have written down other real estate values to levels that will facilitate their liquidation 
we also believe we have appropriately addressed and risk weighted real estate loans in our portfolio 
while deterioration in the portfolio is expected to continue  we believe it will be at a slower pace than the accelerated pace from the past nine quarters 
the allowance to total loans including loans held for sale and the related allowance allocated to those loans in a probable branch divestiture and probable loan sale was at december  while net charge offs totaled basis points for  compared to basis points for non performing loans were million  or of total loans including loans held for sale in probable branch divestiture and probable loan sale at december  compared to million  or of total loans for december  the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans was at december  compared to at december  the decline in the coverage ratio was due to the charge off of specific reserves of million of which million was previously reserved for at december   as well as the increase in restructured loans 

table of contents net interest income was million for compared to million for  while the net interest margin was for compared to in the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a higher level of non performing assets  a decline in average loan balances outstanding  and our efforts to increase liquidity by placing assets into lower yielding investments other than loans 
non interest income decreased million for  primarily driven by an increase of million in the loss on sale and write downs on real estate acquired through foreclosure 
non interest expense increased million to million for the period compared to outside services expense increased due to expenses incurred in connection with loan workout activities and the addition of loan workout specialists to our staff 
fdic insurance premiums increased  due to the higher fdic insurance rate resulting from the bank s regulatory rating 
expense related to real estate acquired through foreclosure increased  due to the higher level of properties in this portfolio at december  loan expense increased due to increases in loan portfolio management expenses such as the cost of obtaining new appraisals on real estate securing some of our commercial real estate loans 
the increase in loan expense reflects our elevated level of non performing loans 
other expense increased due to increases in interchange expense  examination and legal fees and losses on low income housing investments 
in its consent order with the fdic and kdfi  the bank agreed to achieve and maintain a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by june  at december   we were not in compliance with the tier and total risk based capital requirements 
we notified the bank regulatory agencies that the increased capital levels would not be achieved and anticipate that the fdic and kdfi will reevaluate our progress toward achieving the higher capital ratios at june  on march   the bank entered into a new consent order with the fdic and kdfi 
the new consent order requires the bank to achieve the same minimum capital ratios set forth in the january consent order by june  the bank also agreed that if it should be unable to reach the required capital levels by that date and if directed in writing by the fdic  then the bank would within days develop  adopt and implement a written plan to sell or merge itself into another federally insured financial institution 
the new consent order requires the bank to continue to adhere to the plans implemented in response to the january consent order  and includes the substantive provisions of the january consent order 
the bank s consent order with the fdic and kdfi requires us to obtain the consent of the regional director of the fdic and the commissioner of the kdfi to declare and pay cash dividends to the corporation 
we are also no longer allowed to accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits including deposits through the cdars program without prior regulatory approval 
on april   the corporation entered into a formal agreement with the federal reserve bank of st 
louis  which requires the corporation to obtain regulatory approval before declaring any dividends 
we also may not redeem shares or obtain additional borrowings without prior approval 
bank regulatory agencies can exercise discretion when an institution does not meet the terms of a consent order 
the agencies may initiate changes in management  issue mandatory directives  impose monetary penalties or refrain from formal sanctions  depending on individual circumstances 
any action taken by bank regulatory agencies could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business in order to meet these capital requirements  we have engaged an investment banking firm with expertise in the financial services sector to assist with a review of strategic opportunities available to us 
we continue reducing our costs where possible while taking into consideration the resources necessary to execute our strategies 
we have suspended the annual employee stock ownership contribution  frozen executive management compensation the past three years and into  frozen officer compensation for the past year and into  eliminated board of director fees  reduced marketing expenses  reduced community donation expense  reduced compensation expense through reductions in associates  and implemented various other cost savings initiatives 
expense reductions for were million 
additional cost reductions for are projected to be in excess of million 
we are also evaluating remaining terms on existing contracts and identifying expenses we cannot reduce currently  but expect to be able to in and  such as examination fees and loan workout and other real estate owned expenses 
these efforts will remain ongoing 

table of contents as part of our ongoing capital initiatives  on february   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our four indiana banking centers to first savings bank  fsb  the banking subsidiary of first savings financial group  inc the purchase price will represent a percent premium based on the actual level of consumer and commercial deposits at closing  which totaled million at december  under the agreement  first savings financial group  inc will also acquire government  corporate  other financial institution deposits and municipal deposits  which were million at december   at book value 
a total of million of performing loans will be purchased at a discount of based on the actual level of loans at closing 
the consummated transaction would result in a one time gain of approximately million based on information at december  we believe the transaction places us in a better position to meet the conditions of the regulatory consent order in a manner that is beneficial to our shareholders 
this transaction is projected to increase our tier i capital ratio from to and increase our total risk based capital ratio from to based on information at december   and is expected to close early in the third quarter of our plans for include the following continue to pursue all available strategies to recapitalize the bank 
we are evaluating various specific initiatives to increase our regulatory capital and to reduce our total assets 
strategic alternatives include divesting of branch offices  selling loans and raising capital by selling stock 
continue to serve our community banking customers and operate the corporation and the bank in a safe and sound manner 
we have worked diligently to maintain the strength of our retail and deposit franchise 
the strength of this franchise contributes to earnings to help withstand our credit quality issues 
in addition  the inherent value of the retail franchise will provide value to the bank to accomplish the various capital initiatives 
continue to reduce our lending concentration in commercial real estate by obtaining pay downs and payoffs 
in addition to allowing loans in these concentrations to roll off  we have started initiatives to diversify the bank s lending portfolio and change our lending culture 
the mortgage and consumer lending operations have maintained strong credit quality metrics through this recession 
these areas are being restructured to allow for additional emphasis on retail lending going forward 
we will also emphasize small business lending and will seek resources to add expertise in this area 
our efforts will focus on back to basic community banking and servicing the entire relationship of the customer 
these loans will be used to diversify the loan portfolio of the bank as well as provide for profitability as the bank works through our credit quality issues 
while our concerns about economic conditions in our market continue  we are working towards our long range financial objectives  including building additional core customer relationships  maintaining sufficient liquidity and capital levels  improving shareholder value  remediating our problem assets and building upon the sustained success of our retail franchise 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could change as our estimates  assumptions  and judgments change 
certain policies inherently rely more heavily on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance we believe to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan loss review committee  which is comprised of senior officers and certain accounting associates  evaluate the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
we estimate the amount of the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the 
table of contents underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio depend more on credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable incurred losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate required us to record a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million for the period 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could materially increase 
impairment of investment securities we review all unrealized losses on our investment securities to determine whether the losses are other than temporary 
we evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant  to determine whether a decline in their value below amortized cost is other than temporary 
we evaluate a number of factors including  but not limited to valuation estimates provided by investment brokers  how much fair value has declined below amortized cost  how long the decline in fair value has existed  the financial condition of the issuer  significant rating agency changes on the issuer  and management s assessment that we do not intend to sell or will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the possibility for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and a charge to earnings is recognized for the credit component and the non credit component is recorded to other comprehensive income 
real estate owned the estimation of fair value is significant to real estate owned acquired through foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets when available 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
appraisals are performed at least annually  if not more frequently 
typically  appraised values are discounted for the projected sale below appraised value in addition to the selling cost 
with certain appraised values where management believes a solid liquidation value has been established  the appraisal has been discounted by the selling cost 
we have dedicated a team of associates and management to the resolution and work out of other real estate owned as it has become a larger portion of our assets and a larger area of our risk 
appropriate policies  committees and procedures have been put in place to ensure the proper accounting treatment and risk management of this area 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income loss as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
an assessment is made as to whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax 
table of contents payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
tax credits are recorded as a reduction to tax provision in the period for which the credits may be utilized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including our three year cumulative loss position and the fact that we did not meet our forecast levels in and these factors represent the most significant negative evidence that we considered in concluding that a valuation allowance was necessary at december  and december  results of operations net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in contributing to the net loss for was a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase of million in provision for loan losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million write downs taken on real estate acquired through foreclosure  higher fdic insurance premiums  and a higher level of other non interest expense 
net loss attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by dividends accrued on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net loss attributable to common shareholders for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net loss attributable to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share for the same period in contributing to the net loss for was a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase of million in provision for loan losses  a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of million  write downs taken on investment securities that were other than temporarily impaired  write downs taken on real estate acquired through foreclosure  and higher fdic insurance premiums 
net loss attributable to common shareholders was also impacted by dividends paid on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as changes in market interest rates 
the decline in the volume of interest earning assets and the change in the mix of interest earning assets caused a negative impact on net interest income  which decreased million for compared to a year ago 
average interest earning assets decreased million for compared to due to a decrease in average loans and our efforts to increase liquidity by increasing lower yielding investments 
the decrease in average loans was due to loan principal payments  payoffs  charge offs and the conversion of nonperforming loans to other real estate owned properties 
the average loan yield was for compared to an average loan yield of for the shift in the mix of assets resulting from the addition of lower yielding assets and the increase in the amount of non performing assets also negatively impacted our net interest margin 
the yield on earning assets averaged for compared to an average yield on earning assets of for this decrease was offset somewhat by a decrease in our cost of funds 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets decreased basis points to for compared to for our cost of funds averaged for compared to an average cost of funds of for going forward  we expect market short term interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time 
continued re pricing of variable rate loans and our efforts to increase liquidity by increasing lower yielding investments other than loans is likely to further compress our net interest margin in future quarters

contributing to the decline in consumer overdraft activity were the amended regulation e guidelines  which took effect on august  the amended reg 
e guidelines prohibit financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one time debit card transactions  unless a consumer affirmatively consents  or opts in  to the overdraft service for those types of transactions 
we believe these guidelines had a negative impact on ur net income for and will have a negative impact in future quarters 
we are evaluating all of the fees we charge for our deposit products to determine if and when we will revise fees in an effort to partially mitigate the anticipated loss of overdraft related income

the fdic adopted a requirement that all banks prepay three and a quarter years worth of fdic assessments on december  the prepaid amount will be amortized over the prepayment period 
our prepayment was million of which million was reflected in our income statement 
because the bank entered into the consent order and is designated a troubled institution it is in a higher risk category and now pays a higher assessment rate 
the increase in real estate acquired through foreclosure expense was primarily due to increases in expense relating to repair  maintenance  insurance  attorney fees and taxes due to a higher volume of properties in this portfolio at december  loan expense increased due to increases in loan portfolio management expenses such as the cost of obtaining new appraisals on real estate securing some of our commercial real estate loans 
the increase in loan expense reflects our elevated level of non performing loans for compared to other expense increased primarily due to increases in interchange expense  examination and legal fees  and losses on low income housing investments 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal and state income taxes and in and reflects a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets that are not currently recoverable through carryback 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a benefit of compared to a benefit of for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  is not meaningful due to the size of our operating loss relative to income tax expense recorded resulting from a charge to establish a valuation allowance 
historically  the fluctuations in effective tax rates reflect the effect of the differences in the inclusion or deductibility of certain income and expenses  respectively  for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required when it is considered more likely than not that all or part of the benefit related to such assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including our three year cumulative loss position and the fact that we did not meet our forecast levels in and primarily due to higher levels of provision for loan loss expense 
these factors represent the most significant negative evidence that we considered in concluding that 
table of contents a valuation allowance was necessary at december  and december  our tax benefit is entirely due to gains in other comprehensive income that are presented in current operations in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
our future effective income tax rate will fluctuate based on the mix of taxable and tax free investments we make and  to a greater extent  the impact of changes in the required amount of valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets and our overall level of taxable income 
recording a valuation allowance does not have any impact on our liquidity  nor does it preclude us from using the tax losses  tax credits or other timing differences in the future 
to the extent that we generate taxable income in a given quarter  the valuation allowance may be reduced to fully or partially offset the corresponding income tax expense 
any remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance may be reversed through income tax expense once we can demonstrate a sustainable return to profitability and conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will be utilized prior to expiration 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our income taxes 
analysis of financial condition total assets at december  decreased to billion compared to billion at december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in total loans  including loans held for sale in connection with a probable branch divestiture and probable loan sale  of million  and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
this decrease was mainly offset by building our investment portfolio to million  an increase of million since december  this shift in the balance sheet reflects a conscious effort by management to increase on balance sheet liquidity to better protect us against adverse changes to our current wholesale funding position 
loans total loans  including loans held for sale in connection with a probable branch divesture and probable loan sale  decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  our commercial real estate and commercial portfolios decreased million to million at december  our residential mortgage loan  real estate construction  consumer and home equity and indirect consumer portfolios all decreased for the period 
the decline in our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios is a result of pay offs  charge offs on large commercial real estate loans  and commercial loans being transferred to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
charge offs made up million or of this decrease 
the loan portfolio also declined due to our aggressive efforts to resolve problem loans 
during and  we took deeds in lieu of foreclosure on several large commercial real estate properties  moving them to our other real estate owned portfolio

table of contents allowance and provision for loan losses our financial performance depends on the quality of the loans we originate and management s ability to assess the degree of risk in existing loans when it determines the allowance for loan losses 
an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital  and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses monthly to maintain a level it believes to be sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the committee determines the allowance by applying loss estimates to graded loans by categories  as described below 
when appropriate  a specific reserve will be established for individual loans based upon the risk classification and the estimated potential for loss 
in accordance with our credit management processes  we obtain new appraisals on properties securing our non performing commercial real estate loans and use those appraisals to determine specific reserves within the allowance for loan losses 
as we receive new appraisals on properties securing non performing loans  we recognize charge offs and adjust specific reserves as appropriate 
in addition  the committee analyzes such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
further declines in collateral values  including commercial real estate  may impact our ability to collect on certain loans when borrowers are dependent on the values of the real estate as a source of cash flow 
beginning the second half of and continuing into  we substantially increased our provision for loan losses for our general and specific reserves as we identified adverse conditions 
the foreseeable future will continue to be a challenging time as we manage the overall level of our credit quality 
it is likely that provision for loan losses will remain elevated in the near term 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we entered into a consent order with bank regulatory agencies 
in addition to increasing capital ratios  we agreed to maintain adequate reserves for loan losses  develop and implement a plan to reduce the level of non performing assets through collection  disposition  charge off or improvement in the credit quality of the loans  develop and implement a plan to reduce concentrations of credit in commercial real estate loans  implement revised credit risk management practices and credit administration policies and procedures and to report our progress to the regulators

we require appraisals and perform evaluations on impaired assets upon initial identification 
thereafter  we obtain appraisals or perform market value evaluations on impaired assets at least annually 
recognizing the volatility of certain assets  we assess the transaction and market conditions to determine if updated appraisals are needed more frequently than annually 
additionally  we evaluate the collateral condition and value upon foreclosure 
the higher provision was also due to our increasing the general reserve provisioning levels for commercial real estate loans due to the general credit quality trend and the higher level of charge offs 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million to million from december  to december  the decrease was driven by net charge offs of million taken during the period  including specific reserves of million on our collateral dependent loans of which million was previously reserved for at december   in addition to taking other write downs on loans to reflect updated appraisal information obtained as part of our on going monitoring of the loan portfolio 
this was due to appraisal values declining significantly on one to four family residential developments during above declines experienced during we believe these values are at or near liquidation value at december  we also believe this concentration has been fully identified and properly risk rated 
the pass loans in this concentration have been separately evaluated for general allowance allocations 
the decline in the specific reserves from charge offs resulted in a decline in the allowance as a percent of total loans and the allowance as a percent of non performing loans 
the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans was for december  compared to at december  specific reserves as allocated to substandard loans made up of the total allowance for loan loss at december  net charge offs for the

during  we continued our efforts to ensure the adequacy of the allowance by adding specific reserves to several large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
the higher provision was also due to our increasing the general reserve provisioning levels for commercial real estate loans due to the increase in classified loans for the period 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million from december  to december  the increase was due to specific reserves placed on loans due to updated appraisal information obtained as part of our on going monitoring of the loan portfolio  as well as the provision recorded to reflect an increase in classified loans for the period 
specific reserves as allocated to substandard loans made up of the total allowance for loan loss at december  the increase in charge offs for was primarily attributed to charging down previously recorded specific reserves on non performing loans whose condition worsened during the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors 
since these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not a prediction of future portfolio performance

table of contents approximately million or of the total classified loans at december  were related to commercial real estate loans in our market area 
several of the non performing loans that were added during the period were adequately collateralized and therefore did not require additional reserves 
classified consumer loans totaled million  classified mortgage loans totaled million and classified commercial loans totaled million 
the change in our level of allowance for loan losses is a result of a consistent allowance methodology that is driven by risk ratings 
for more information on collection efforts  evaluation of collateral and how loss amounts are estimated  see non performing assets  below 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
if economic conditions continue to put stress on our borrowers going forward  this may require higher provisions for loan losses in future periods 
credit quality will continue to be a primary focus during and going forward 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain non accruing restructured loans for which the interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans longer than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest payments in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
if a loan is impaired  we allocate a portion of the allowance so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral 
loans that have been restructured are generally placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which will require that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance in accordance to the restructured terms of six months or more 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis 
these loans are placed on non accrual status upon becoming contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest or where substantial doubt about full repayment of principal and interest is evident 
we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair value 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense 
real estate owned acquired through foreclosure is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
we monitor market information and the age of appraisals on existing real estate owned 
table of contents properties and obtain new appraisals as circumstances warrant 
real estate acquired through foreclosure increased million to million at december  real estate acquired through foreclosure includes million in land development properties and building lots located primarily in our jefferson county market 
we anticipate that our level of real estate acquired through foreclosure will remain at elevated levels for some period of time as foreclosures reflecting both weak economic conditions and soft commercial real estate values continue 
we also have sales contracts in place on eleven other real estate owned properties totaling million set to close during the first quarter of indicating continued improvement in classified credits 
all properties held in other real estate owned are listed for sale with various independent real estate agents

loans that have been restructured are generally placed on nonaccrual status until we determine the future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which will require that the borrower demonstrates a period of performance in accordance to the restructured terms of six months or more 
the change in non accrual loans resulted from the addition of seventeen non accrual relationships totaling million 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in non accrual loans due to write downs of million based upon updated appraisals and  transfers of six non accrual relationships totaling million to real estate acquired through foreclosure

table of contents development in jefferson and oldham counties contributed significantly to the increases in our non performing loans for and and in our non performing assets for  and at december   substantially all of our residential housing development assets in these counties have been classified as impaired and written down to what we believe to be at or near liquidation value

two of the newly restructured credits are strip centers that experienced vacancies 
one strip center lost a big box retailer and is currently in discussions with another larger retailer to fill the vacancy 
the interest only period is to allow for the borrower to secure the new tenant 
the second strip center has partially replaced a vacancy with a new tenant and was granted an interest only period to fill the remaining space 
the commercial office building is on accrual status at this property has experienced improvement with additional tenants and cash flows on a proper basis 
the loans were evaluated as impaired loans and appropriately allocated specific reserve allowances 
the terms of our restructured loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest or extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the borrowers are currently meeting the terms of the restructured loans 
we anticipate that our level of restructured loans will continue to increase as we identify borrowers in financial difficulty and work with them to modify to more affordable terms 
investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings  and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the available for sale investment portfolio increased by million due to the purchase of us government agency securities  government sponsored mortgage backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions 
recent purchases have been high cash flow instruments with short average lives in order to decrease the volatility of the investment portfolio as well as provide cash flow in order to limit interest rate risk 
we evaluate investment securities with significant declines in fair value on a quarterly basis to determine whether they should be considered other than temporarily impaired under current accounting guidance  which generally provides that if a security is in an unrealized loss position  whether due to general market conditions or industry or issuer specific factors  the holder of the securities must assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether management has the intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we may consider whether the 
table of contents securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
the unrealized losses on our government sponsored mortgage backed residential securities were a result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  we have evaluated the decline in the fair value of our trust preferred securities  which are directly related to the credit and liquidity crisis that the financial services industry has experienced in recent years 
the trust preferred securities market is currently inactive making the valuation of trust preferred securities very difficult 
we value trust preferred securities using unobservable inputs through a discounted cash flow analysis as permitted under current accounting guidance and using the expected cash flows appropriately discounted using present value techniques 
refer to note fair value for more information 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  for the expected credit loss during the period and million during the time we have held these securities on five of our trust preferred securities with an original cost basis of million 
all of our trust preferred securities are currently rated below investment grade 
one of our trust preferred securities continues to pay interest as scheduled through december   and is expected to continue paying interest as scheduled 
the other four trust preferred securities are paying either partial or full interest in kind instead of full cash interest 
see note securities for more information

deposits we rely primarily on providing excellent customer service and fostering long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
total deposits decreased million compared to december  retail and commercial deposits decreased million 
public funds increased million 
brokered deposits and certificate of deposits account registry service cdars certificates decreased million 
the decline in money market balances was partially due to a decline in the balance of one of our commercial customers who used million in money market funds to pay down a loan 
brokered deposits were million at december  compared to million at december  as a result of our consent order with bank regulatory agencies  we are no longer allowed to accept  renew or rollover brokered deposits including deposits through the cdars program without prior regulatory approval 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin 
however  the consent order resulted in the bank being categorized as a troubled institution by bank regulators 
the troubled institution designation restricts the amount of interest the bank may pay on deposits 
unless the bank is granted a waiver because it resides in a market that the fdic determines is a high rate market  the bank is limited to paying deposit interest rates within 
of the average rates computed by the fdic 
the bank must apply annually to be granted this waiver  which it has done and was granted for we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms  interest rates and minimum deposit requirements 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more

we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debt from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years 
the subordinated debentures are considered as tier i capital for the corporation under current regulatory guidelines

our trust subsidiaries loaned the proceeds of their offerings of trust preferred securities to us in exchange for junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
we are not considered the primary beneficiary of these trusts variable interest entity  therefore the trusts are not consolidated in our financial statements  but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability 
our investment in the common stock of the trusts was  on october   we exercised our right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on both issues of junior subordinated notes  together having an outstanding principal amount of million  relating to outstanding trust preferred securities 
we have the right to defer payments of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty 
after such period  we must pay all deferred interest and resume quarterly interest payments or we will be in default 
during the deferral period  the statutory trusts  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of first financial service corporation formed to issue the trust preferred securities  will likewise suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities

table of contents liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
our investment and funds management policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the asset liability committee continually monitors our liquidity position 
our banking centers provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
in addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base  we maintain adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
we believe that we have adequate funding sources through unpledged investment securities  loan principal repayments  and potential asset maturities and sales to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock  make selected investments and acquisitions  and service debt 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kdfi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
the bank s consent order with the fdic and kdfi requires us to obtain the consent of the regional director of the fdic and the commissioner of the kdfi to declare and pay cash dividends to the corporation 
the corporation has also entered into a formal agreement with the federal reserve to obtain regulatory approval before declaring any dividends 
we may not redeem shares or obtain additional borrowings without prior approval 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank did not declare or pay any dividends to the corporation 
cash held by the corporation at december  was  compared to cash of  at december  capital stockholders equity decreased million during  primarily due to a net loss recorded during the period 
offsetting this decrease was a decrease in unrealized losses on securities available for sale 
our average stockholders equity to average assets ratio decreased to at december  compared to at the end of on january   we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares  with a liquidation preference of  per share the senior preferred shares to the us treasury under the terms of its capital purchase program 
the senior preferred shares constitute tier capital and rank senior to our common shares 
the senior preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per year after five years 
under the terms of our cpp stock purchase agreement  we also issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to of the aggregate amount of the senior preferred shares  or million 
the warrant entitles the us treasury to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the initial exercise price for the warrant and the number of shares subject to the warrant were determined by reference to the market price of our common stock calculated on a day trailing average as of december   the date the us treasury approved our application 
the warrant has a term of years and is potentially dilutive to earnings per share 

table of contents on october   we gave written notice to the us treasury that effective with the fourth quarter of  we were suspending the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on our senior preferred shares 
the dividends are cumulative and failure to pay dividends for six quarters would trigger the rights of the holder of our senior preferred shares to appoint representatives to our board of directors 
the dividends will continue to be accrued for payment in the future and reported as a preferred dividend requirement that is deducted from income to common shareholders for financial statement purposes 
in addition to our agreement with the federal reserve that requires prior written consent to repurchase common shares  the terms of our senior preferred shares do not allow us to repurchase shares of our common stock without the consent of the holder until the senior preferred shares are redeemed 
during  we did not purchase any shares of our common stock 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banks 
banks must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets ranging from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization s overall safety and soundness 
in its consent order with the fdic and kdfi  the bank has agreed to achieve and maintain a tier leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of by june  at december   we were not in compliance with the tier and total risk based capital requirements 
we notified the bank regulatory agencies that the increased capital levels would not be achieved and anticipate that the fdic and kdfi will reevaluate our progress toward achieving the higher capital ratios at june  on march   the bank entered into a new consent order with the fdic and kdfi 
the new consent order requires the bank to achieve the same minimum capital ratios set forth in the january consent order by june  the bank also agreed that if it should be unable to reach the required capital levels by that date and if directed in writing by the fdic  then the bank would within days develop  adopt and implement a written plan to sell or merge itself into another federally insured financial institution 
the new consent order requires the bank to continue to adhere to the plans implemented in response to the january consent order  and includes the substantive provisions of the january consent order 
we are working on various specific initiatives to increase our regulatory capital and to reduce our total assets such as the sale of branch offices and raising common stock 
as part of our ongoing capital initiatives  on february   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our four indiana banking centers to first savings bank  fsb the transaction is projected to increase our tier i capital ratio from to and increase our total risk based capital ratio from to based on information at december   and is expected to close early in the third quarter of the following table shows the ratios of tier capital  total capital to risk adjusted assets and the leverage ratios for the corporation and the bank as of december

these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
three of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb 
the fhlb has the right to convert these advances to a variable rate or we can prepay the advances at no penalty 
there is a substantial penalty if we prepay the advances before the fhlb exercises its right 
we do not believe the convertible fixed rate advances will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature june  and march   are redeemable before the maturity date at our option on or after june  and march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture 
the interest rate on the subordinated debentures is at a year fixed rate of and a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus on october   we exercised our right to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on both issues of junior subordinated notes  together having an outstanding principal amount of million  relating to outstanding trust preferred securities 
we have the right to defer payments of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods without default or penalty 
after such period  we must pay all deferred interest and resume quarterly interest payments or we will be in default 
during the deferral period  the respective statutory trusts  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of first financial service corporation  that were formed to issue the trust preferred securities  will likewise suspend the declaration and payment of dividends on the trust preferred securities 
the regular scheduled interest payments will continue to be accrued for payment in the future and reported as an expense for financial statement purposes 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this filing have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
comprised of senior management representatives  the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of 
at december  given a sustained basis point increase in interest rates  our base net interest income would increase by an estimated 
at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  our balance sheet has an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will increase 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will decrease
