item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
surplus and capital requirements insurance regulators have the discretionary authority  in connection with the ongoing licensing of our insurance subsidiaries  to limit or prohibit the ability of an insurer to issue new policies if  in the regulators judgment  the insurer is not maintaining a minimum amount of surplus or is in hazardous financial condition 

table of contents insurance regulators may also limit the ability of an insurer to issue new life insurance policies and annuity contracts above an amount based upon the face amount and premiums of policies of a similar type issued in the prior year 
we do not believe that the current or anticipated levels of statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries present a material risk that any such regulator would limit the amount of new policies that our insurance subsidiaries may issue 
risk based capital the naic has established risk based capital standards for life insurance companies as well as a model act with the intention that these standards be applied at the state level 
the model act provides that life insurance companies must submit an annual risk based capital report to state regulators reporting their risk based capital based upon four categories of risk asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
for each category  the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to various asset  premium and reserve items  with the factor being higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for less risky items 
the formula is intended to be used by insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify possible weakly capitalized companies for purposes of initiating further regulatory action 
if an insurer s risk based capital falls below specified levels  the insurer would be subject to different degrees of regulatory action depending upon the level 
these actions range from requiring the insurer to propose actions to correct the capital deficiency to placing the insurer under regulatory control 
as of december   the risk based capital of each of our life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of risk based capital that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action 
as of december   symetra life insurance company  our primary life insurance subsidiary  had a risk based capital ratio of 
statutory accounting principles statutory accounting principles  or sap  is a basis of accounting developed by state insurance regulators to monitor and regulate the solvency of insurance companies 
in developing sap  insurance regulators were primarily concerned with assuring an insurer s ability to pay all of its current and future obligations to policyholders 
as a result  statutory accounting focuses on conservatively valuing the assets and liabilities of insurers  generally in accordance with standards specified by the insurer s domiciliary state 
uniform statutory accounting practices are established by the naic and generally adopted by regulators in the various states 
these accounting principles and related regulations determine  among other things  the amounts our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us as dividends 
the values for assets  liabilities and equity reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap may be different from those reflected in financial statements prepared under sap 
regulation of investments each of our insurance subsidiaries is subject to laws and regulations that require diversification of its investment portfolio and limit the amount of investments in certain asset categories  such as below investment grade fixed maturities  real estate  equity investments and derivatives 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring surplus  and  in some instances  would require divestiture of such non complying investments 
we believe the investments held by our insurance subsidiaries comply with these laws and regulations 
in addition  related laws and regulations addressing insolvency of life insurance companies also may indirectly limit symetra life insurance company s ability to invest assets in certain types of derivative contracts 
federal regulation of insurance currently  the federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance 
however  the dodd frank act created a federal insurance office 
while the office will not directly regulate domestic insurance business  it is tasked with studying the potential efficiency and consequences of federal insurance regulation 

table of contents although the federal government does not comprehensively regulate the business of insurance  federal legislation and administrative policies in several other areas  including taxation  privacy regulation  financial services regulation  securities and pension and welfare benefits regulation  can also significantly affect the insurance industry 
from time to time  federal measures are proposed that may significantly affect the insurance business  including direct federal regulation of insurance through an optional federal charter  limitations on antitrust immunity  tax incentives for lifetime annuity payouts  simplification bills affecting tax advantaged or tax exempt savings and retirement vehicles  and the federal estate tax 
likewise  there exists uncertainties relating to the proposals and rules that have been written and yet to be written by various federal agencies as part of the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act  and the dodd frank act 
we cannot predict whether these or other proposals or rules will be adopted  or what impact  if any  such proposals or rules may have on our business 
tax laws existing federal laws and regulations provide favorable tax treatment to many insurance products we offer 
congress  from time to time  considers legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers  including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax advantages within life insurance and annuity products 
if existing federal laws and regulations are revised to reduce this favorable tax treatment or to increase the tax deferred status of competing products  we  along with other life insurance companies  will be adversely affected with respect to our ability to sell such products 
furthermore  although congress has reinstated the estate tax for and  congress also considers from time to time the repeal of the federal estate tax which may adversely affect sales and surrenders of our life insurance products 
other laws and regulations securities regulation certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various levels of regulation under the federal securities laws administered by the sec 
variable contracts issued by our life insurance subsidiaries are securities 
most are registered under the act and are fully subject to the act and rules thereunder 
other variable contracts are sold in non public offerings in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of the act  but are subject to its anti fraud provisions 
one of our broker dealer subsidiaries serves as principal underwriter of the variable contracts and is regulated by the sec under the act and rules thereunder as well as by finra under its rules 
another subsidiary is a full service broker dealer that is likewise subject to sec and finra regulation 
various state and local regulators also may regulate our broker dealers 
the registered representatives of both broker dealers are regulated by the sec and finra and are also subject to applicable state and local laws 
our business partners in the sale and distribution of variable contracts and other securities are likewise regulated by these laws and regulations eg  unaffiliated broker dealers that have selling agreements with our broker dealers 
certain separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries through which variable contracts are issued are registered with the sec as investment companies under the act as will be several mutual funds recently formed by us 
both the act and the advisers act impose a complex and rigorous regulatory regime on investment companies and investment advisers 
certain separate accounts of our life insurance subsidiaries through which variable contracts not registered under the act are issued  are not registered as investment companies in reliance upon exclusions from the definition of an investment company found in the act 
nevertheless  certain provisions of the act apply to such separate accounts 
our recently formed investment adviser is registered with the sec under the investment advisers act of the advisers act  as is our full service broker dealer 
certain employees of our investment advisers are licensed as advisory representatives in states where those employees have clients and are subject to regulation by those states 

table of contents the laws and regulations identified above are subject to change  which may affect our subsidiaries  employees and business partners subject to them 
the last several years have seen dramatic  far reaching and rapid change in these laws and regulations and we anticipate such changes will continue through the end of and beyond 
interpreting new laws and regulations  and obtaining timely guidance about them from the applicable regulator  are often challenging 
maintaining compliance in this environment is a constant challenge and the risk of an inadvertent error or omission is ever present 
consistent with this  our costs to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations continues to increase 
the laws and regulations identified above are primarily intended to protect investors in the securities markets and generally grant the sec and other regulators broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 
in the event of failure by our subsidiaries  employees and business partners to comply  possible sanctions that regulators may impose include censures or fines of our life insurance companies  broker dealers or investment advisers  suspension or limitation of sales of our products  suspension of individual employees or agents  limitations on the activities in which our investment advisers or broker dealers may engage  suspension or revocation of registration or licenses of our broker dealers or investment advisers  and public disclosure of our failure to comply which may damage our reputation or that of our business partners and or encourage private litigation 
employee retirement income security act and internal revenue code considerations we provide certain products and services to certain employee benefits plans that are subject to employee retirement income security act  or erisa  or the internal revenue code 
as such  our activities are subject to the restrictions imposed by erisa and the internal revenue code  including the requirement under erisa that fiduciaries must perform their duties solely in the interests of erisa plan participants and beneficiaries and the requirement under erisa and the internal revenue code that fiduciaries may not cause a covered plan to engage in certain prohibited transactions with persons who have certain relationships with respect to such plans 
the applicable provisions of erisa and the internal revenue code are subject to enforcement by the us department of labor  the irs and the pension benefit guaranty corporation 
privacy of consumer information us federal and state laws and regulations require financial institutions  including insurance companies  to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer financial information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information 
similarly  federal and state laws and regulations also govern the disclosure and security of consumer health information 
in particular  regulations promulgated by the us department of health and human services regulate the disclosure and use of protected health information by health insurers and others  the physical and procedural safeguards employed to protect the security of that information and the electronic transmission of such information 
congress and state legislatures from time to time consider additional legislation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business fluctuations in interest rates and interest rate spreads could impact sales  profitability or cash flows of interest rate sensitive products 
certain of our insurance and investment products  such as fixed annuities and universal life insurance  are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
changes in interest rates may make our products less attractive to customers seeking higher yields  which could adversely impact our sales or trigger increased surrenders and withdrawals 
for example  when the initial guaranteed interest rate period for fixed annuity products expires  we may significantly decrease renewal crediting rates below the initial rates  which may impact our ability to obtain and retain business 
fluctuations in interest rates may also reduce the spread  or the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations and the amounts that we must credit to policyholders and contract holders  which could adversely impact the profitability of those products and therefore our results of operations 
reductions in expected profitability or increased surrenders and withdrawals may require us to accelerate amortization of associated deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  and deferred sales inducements  or dsi  balances  further decreasing our results of operations 
prolonged periods of low interest rates prolonged periods of low interest rates may have a negative impact on our ability to sell products that are dependent on interest earnings  such as fixed annuity and universal life products  as consumers look for other high yielding investment vehicles to fund retirement 
in low interest rate environments  such as we experienced during and which we expect to continue to experience in  it is difficult to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability  which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products 
sustained declines in interest may subject us to lower returns on our invested assets  and we may have to reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments 
this may reduce our future net investment income and compress the spread on interest rate sensitive products 
further  borrowers may prepay fixed maturity securities in order to borrow at lower market rates 
any related prepayment fees are recorded in net investment income and may create income statement volatility 
this risk is exacerbated by guaranteed minimum crediting rates established by our contracts and or regulatory authorities  and restrictions on the timing and frequency with which we can adjust our crediting rates 
our interest rate spreads vary by product 
by comparing the unadjusted interest spreads to the interest spreads adjusted to remove the effect of prepayments the following table illustrates the volatility investment prepayments can have on our fixed deferred annuity spreads year ended december  fixed annuities interest spread base interest spread interest spread is the difference between the net investment yield and the credited rate to policyholders 
the net investment yield is the approximate yield on invested assets in the general account attributed to the segment 
the credited rate is the approximate rate credited on policyholder fixed account values 
interest credited is subject to contractual terms  including minimum guarantees 
base interest spread is the interest spread adjusted to exclude items that can vary significantly from period to period due to a number of factors and  therefore  may contribute to yields that are not indicative of the underlying trends 
this is primarily the impact of asset prepayments  such as bond make whole premiums  net of any related deferred sales inducement unlocking  and the mbs prepayment speed adjustment 

table of contents in addition to our fixed deferred annuities  the performance of our long term income annuities and boli products is also sensitive to the investment yields on our invested assets backing such products 
in extreme situations  the investment yield earned could be lower than the credited rates guaranteed to the customers 
we may not be able to successfully manage interest rate spreads or the potential negative impact of those risks 
our term life insurance products also expose us to the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns 
over time  term life insurance products generally produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums  which we invest as received 
lower than expected interest rates may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins on these products 
we mitigate some of the aforementioned risks by reducing guaranteed minimum crediting rates offered on new business and  for our deferred annuity products  lowering up front commissions 
however  sustained low interest rates may require us to limit offerings of certain products 
periods of rising interest rates we are also subject to risks associated with periods of rising interest rates 
during such times  we may offer higher crediting rates on new sales of interest sensitive products and increase crediting rates on existing in force products to maintain or enhance product competitiveness 
we may not be able to purchase enough higher yielding assets necessary to fund higher crediting rates and maintain our desired spread  which could result in lower profitability on our in force business 
in rising interest rate environments  especially when interest rates are rapidly rising  it may be difficult to position our products to offer attractive rates and benefits to customers while maintaining profitability  which may limit sales growth of interest sensitive products 
in order to maintain sales growth of interest sensitive products and retain inforce customers  we may offer higher renewal crediting rates which would impact profitability 
in addition  periods of rising interest rates may cause increased policy surrenders  withdrawals and requests for policy loans on deferred annuity and boli products  as policyholders and contract holders seek investments with higher returns  referred to as disintermediation 
this may lead to net cash outflows and the resulting liquidity demands may require us to sell investment assets when the prices of those assets are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates  which may result in realized investment losses 
further  a portion of our investment portfolio consists of commercial mortgage loans and privately placed securities  which are relatively illiquid  thus increasing our liquidity risk in the event of disintermediation 
we may also be required to accelerate the amortization of dac and dsi related to surrendered contracts  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in yield curves shifts in the relationship between short and long term interest rates  or yield curve  can also impact our ability to sell our products  particularly fixed annuities 
when the yield curve is relatively flat or negatively sloped ie  high short term rates as compared to long term rates  customers can receive similar crediting rates on competing products  such as certificates of deposit  which have shorter required investment periods 
customers may be more likely to choose those competing products than our annuities  which tend to be longer term in nature 
our investment portfolio is subject to various interest rate  credit and liquidity risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets  reduce investment returns and or erode capital 
the performance of our investment portfolio depends in part upon the level of and changes in interest rates and credit spreads  the overall performance of the economy  the creditworthiness of the specific obligors included in our portfolio  equity prices  liquidity and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors 
table of contents could materially affect our investment results in any period and or erode capital 
as of december   our total investments were billion  of which billion were fixed maturities 
our fixed maturities portfolio generated net investment income of  million and  million  and realized gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest rate and credit spread risk interest rates and credit spreads are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  general investor sentiment  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual net investment income or cash flows to differ from those originally anticipated for investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other securities with embedded call options 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments generally increase 
mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage obligations and other bonds in our investment portfolio may be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates 
if unanticipated  such prepayments may require us to accelerate amortization on investments purchased at a premium  which could decrease our net investment income 
such prepayments may also include prepayment fees and penalties recorded as income in the period of prepayment which could create income volatility 
additionally for prepayments  we may be required to reinvest those funds in lower interest bearing investments 
current concerns over foreclosures and increasing government intervention and governmental programs such as harp housing affordability refinance program or similar programs in the united states residential mortgage market could result in large numbers of refinancing and prepayments 
as of december   we held  million in residential mortgage backed securities  including gross unamortized premiums of million  and an increase in prepayments could significantly accelerate our premium amortization and result in asset reinvestment at lower interest rates 
we include an estimate of future principal prepayments in the calculation of effective yields for mortgage backed securities 
differences between the actual and estimated timing of the principal prepayments impact our investment income and may reduce our overall interest rate spread 
as prepayments increase in periods of declining interest rates  premium amortization accelerates because the expected life of the asset is shortened 
in periods of rising interest rates  prepayments generally slow  and discount amortization slows because the expected life of the asset is extended 
these changes in amortization may adversely affect our investment income 
in addition  net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease in step with interest rates and credit spreads 
in periods of low interest rates  such as we experienced during and  we may be challenged to find attractive yields on new investments 
in and  we mitigated this risk by increasing our originations of commercial mortgage loans  which generally provided higher yields  but are less liquid than fixed maturities securities  however  we may be unable to continue to find appropriate loan opportunities meeting our high quality standards 
the fair value of our fixed maturities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with changes in interest rates and credit spreads 
because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available for sale  changes in the fair value of these securities are reflected as a component of comprehensive income 
a rise in interest rates may cause the fair value of our fixed maturity securities to decline  particularly for our long duration investments supporting our income annuities reserves 
declines in fair value may decrease unrealized gains or result in unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  and decrease our stockholders equity 
further  us gaap does not require similar fair value accounting treatment for the insurance liabilities that the fixed maturities support 
therefore  changes in the fair value of our fixed maturities caused by interest rate fluctuations are not offset in whole or in part by similar adjustments to the fair value of our insurance liabilities on the balance sheet 

table of contents we mitigate the risks related to fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads by employing asset to liability matching strategies to help ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due 
however  these strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate and credit spread volatility 
credit risk issuers of the fixed maturities we own may default on principal and interest payments 
defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income or cause realized investment losses 
further  fixed maturities are evaluated for impairment based on our assumptions about the creditworthiness of the issuer 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million in credit related impairments  respectively 
a significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturities portfolio could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the determination of impairments is subject to management s judgment about the creditworthiness and continued cash flows of a security 
while we have controls and procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that our impairment analysis is complete and based on accurate information  actual cash flows and defaults may vary significantly from our assumptions 
as of december   of our total fixed maturity portfolio at fair value was considered below investment grade 
below investment grade securities generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities 
further  an issuer s inability to refinance or pay off debt could cause certain of our investment grade maturities to present more significant credit risk than when we first invested 
private equity and highly leveraged buyouts could also cause certain of our investment grade fixed maturities to present more significant credit risk than when we first invested 
issuers of the fixed maturities that we own may experience threats and performance deterioration that trigger rating agency downgrades 
although the issuers may not have defaulted on principal and interest payments with respect to these securities  we may be required by regulators and rating agencies to hold more capital in support of these investments 
we could experience higher cost of capital and potential constraints on our ability to grow our business and maintain our own ratings 
for further information on our fixed maturities portfolio and credit related impairments  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
liquidity risk our investments in privately placed fixed maturities  mortgage loans  policy loans and limited partnership interests  which collectively represented approximately of total invested assets as of december   are relatively illiquid compared to publicly traded fixed maturities and equities 
in addition  periods of market disruption  such as those experienced in the past three years  could also reduce liquidity for securities generally considered to be readily marketable 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
this risk is mitigated by the liquidity structure of our underlying reserves  of which are considered illiquid or somewhat illiquid 
for further information on the liquidity of our underlying reserves  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to execute on our grow diversify strategy 
in our executive leadership team introduced its grow diversify business strategy that is focused on developing new products that are less sensitive to interest rates  and which we believe will provide long term value to our stockholders 
as part of this strategy  we remain committed to disciplined pricing and risk 
table of contents management  and are focused on products that offer returns in line with our long term roe objective of 
we have and will continue to incur costs related to our grow diversify strategy 
for example  during we spent per share to implement grow diversify 
our expenses include ongoing and build related costs 
the build related costs are startup in nature  mainly those associated with analyzing our operations and strategically aligning and acquiring resources 
however  during the execution of these initiatives we may encounter unforeseen costs 
we expect that our new products will help us take advantage of expected market trends or underdeveloped markets 
we also expect to develop existing strategic distribution partners and form new ones 
we plan to implement grow diversify while maintaining our current positions of strength in our existing businesses  especially our medical stop loss and deferred annuity businesses  as well as maintaining the strength of our balance sheet 
the success of this strategy will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to accurately predict market trends  differentiate our product offerings from our competitors  timely develop new products that achieve market acceptance  effectively implement new technology and operational platforms  deepen our existing distribution relationships and add new distribution partners  and set appropriate prices for our products 
if we fail to accomplish one  all or a combination of the foregoing  our ability to profitably grow our business during this period of prolonged low interest rates could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be unable to increase or maintain sales through independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists 
we distribute our products through financial intermediaries  independent producers and dedicated sales specialists 
we compete with other financial institutions to attract and retain commercial relationships in each of these channels  and our success in competing for sales through these sales intermediaries depends upon factors such as the amount of sales commissions and fees we pay  the breadth of our product offerings  the design and positioning of our product offerings  the amounts of or adjustments we make in premium or interest crediting rates  the strength of our brand  our perceived stability and our financial strength ratings  the marketing and services we provide to them  and the strength of the relationships we maintain with individuals at those firms 
through time our relationship with distributors may deteriorate due to any of the above factors  which could result in a drop in sales and or a loss of existing business due to higher surrender activity 
our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to existing and potential distribution partners to favor their products or to reduce sales of our products 
our contracts with our distribution partners generally allow either party to terminate the relationship upon short notice 
our distribution partners do not make minimum purchase commitments  and our contracts do not prohibit our partners from offering products that compete with ours 
accordingly  our distribution partners may choose not to offer our products exclusively or at all  or may choose to exert insufficient resources and attention to selling our products 
in sales from our top five distribution partners in our deferred annuities and benefits segments represented and  respectively  of each segment s total sales 
in addition  sales from chase accounted for of our deferred annuities segment sales 
if our relationships with these distributors were to deteriorate  it is likely that we would experience a significant decline in our sales 
for further discussion on our sales and distribution  see item business distribution 

table of contents turbulent economic conditions may also impair our distribution partners  which would have an adverse impact on our sales 
further  consolidation of financial institutions could increase competition for access to distributors  result in greater distribution expenses  and impair our ability to market our products to our current customer base or to expand our customer base 
from time to time  due to competitive forces  we may also experience unusually high employee attrition in particular sales channels for specific products 
an inability to recruit productive independent sales intermediaries and dedicated sales specialists  or our inability to retain strong relationships with the individual agents at our independent sales intermediaries  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our future success is highly dependent on maintaining and growing both existing and new distribution relationships 
we may have little or no contact or brand awareness with end customers of our products  which makes it more difficult to respond to evolving customer needs and increases our reliance on our distribution partners 
defaults in our commercial mortgage loans may adversely affect our profitability 
our mortgage loans  which are collateralized by commercial properties  are subject to default risk 
the company seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices 
our underwriting practice includes the analysis of a borrower s prior credit history  financial statements  tax returns and cash flow projections  valuation of collateral  personal guarantees of loans  and verification of liquid assets 
during  we began strategically increasing our mortgage loan portfolio  which continued through for the years ended december  and  we originated million and million  respectively  of new loans 
our mortgage loan portfolio totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
we carry our mortgage loans at outstanding principal balances  adjusted for unamortized deferred fees and costs  net of an allowance for loan losses 
our allowance includes a reserve for probable incurred but not specifically identified losses in the portfolio  and specific reserves for any non performing loans 
the reserve for probable incurred losses is based on our historical experience  third party data for expected losses on loans with similar loan to value  and debt service coverage ratios 
specific reserves are determined by comparing the carrying value of the loan to the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if our underwriting practices fail to capture accurate information or proves to be inadequate  we may incur losses  and those losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves 
as of december   no loans were classified as non performing 
however  due to the uncertain economic environment and the growth in our portfolio  the performance of our mortgage loan portfolio may decline in the future 
in addition  the majority of our loans have balloon payment maturities  which may trigger future defaults on currently performing loans 
an increase in the default rate of our mortgage loan investments  caused by current or worsening economic conditions or otherwise  could result in realized losses or increases in our allowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  any geographic concentration of our commercial mortgage loans may expose us to higher risk of adverse effects on our loan portfolio and  consequently  on our results of operations or financial condition 
while we seek to mitigate this risk by having a diversified portfolio  events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular geographic region or economic sector may have a greater adverse effect on our loan portfolio 
as of december   of our commercial mortgage loans were located in california  primarily in the los angeles area  were located in washington and were located in texas

table of contents gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity and equity securities may become realized or result in future impairments  resulting in a reduction in our net income 
fixed maturity and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at their estimated fair value and compose a significant portion of our total assets 
liquidity needs  portfolio rebalancing  or other reasons may require us to sell these securities prior to maturity  or credit concerns could prompt us to conclude that a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
the resulting realized losses or impairments may have a material adverse effect on our net income 
unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities are recognized as a component of aoci and are therefore excluded from net income 
the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these available for sale securities is recognized in net income when the gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or in the event that the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other than temporary and an impairment charge is taken 
our gross unrealized losses on available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities as of december  were million 
the portion of the gross unrealized losses for fixed maturity and equity securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below amortized cost or cost by or more for six months or greater was million as of december  our valuation of fixed maturity securities may include methodologies  estimations and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
fixed maturities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and represent approximately of our invested assets as of december  the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three level hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation models using unobservable inputs level 
level and level measurements compose a significant portion of our invested assets  as of december   approximately billion  or  of our fixed maturities were categorized as level measurements  and billion  or  were categorized as level because values for securities classified as level and level are not based on quoted market prices for identical instruments  the amount we realize upon settlement or maturity may differ significantly from our reported fair value 
additionally  multiple valuation methods may be applicable to a security  and the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value amounts 
decreases in valuations may result in unrealized losses recorded in stockholders equity or realized losses recorded in net income  which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our level measurements are obtained from our pricing services and derived from models that use objectively verifiable  observable market inputs  such as benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers and other reference data  including market research publications 
because many fixed maturity securities do not trade on a daily basis  evaluated pricing models apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  sector groupings and matrix pricing 
if such information about a security is unavailable  we determine the fair value using internal pricing models that typically utilize significant  unobservable market inputs or inputs that are difficult to corroborate with observable market data 
as of december   million  or  of our fixed maturities portfolio was invested in private placement securities  which are not actively traded 
the fair values of million  or  of these assets are classified as level  as they are determined using a discounted cash flow approach that requires the use of inputs that are not market observable and involves significant judgment 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of significantly rising interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain securities for example  corporate private placements if trading becomes less frequent and or market data becomes less observable 
there may be certain 
table of contents asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to the financial environment 
in such cases  valuations for those securities may require more subjectivity and management judgment  including valuation methods  inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation 
rapidly changing and adverse credit and equity market conditions could also materially impact the valuation of securities reported in our consolidated financial statements  and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
to mitigate these risks  we use established  industry standard valuation models consistently from period to period 
for more information on our valuation methodology for invested assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates assets at fair value 
additionally  our investment management objective is to support the expected cash flows of our liabilities and to produce stable returns over the long term  thus  we typically hold our fixed maturities until maturity or until market conditions are favorable for the sale of such investments 
downturns and volatility in equity markets could adversely affect our profitability 
we recognize changes in fair value of our investments in certain common stock  including reits  or other equity like securities in net income  through net realized investment gains losses 
these investments  which generally provide higher expected total returns over the long term  present a greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed maturity investments 
as of december   less than two percent of our invested assets were invested in securities whose changes in fair value are typically highly correlated with changes in the equity markets 
while these investments do not represent a significant portion of our invested assets  a decline in the equity markets could have a significant adverse effect on our net income  and also increase volatility in results between periods 
for example  for the year ended december   net gains on our equity securities trading portfolio were million  as the s p total return index improved approximately that year 
in the following year  ending december   net losses on our equity securities trading portfolio were million  while the s p total return index increased approximately for the year 
in another example  we implemented a new investment strategy during second quarter of focusing on real estate related investments  which primarily consists of investments in reits 
for the year ended december   our reits provided a total gross return of 
however  during  we experienced volatility in our quarterly results including a total gross loss of for the third quarter  and a total gross gain of for the fourth quarter 
we may face unanticipated losses if we determine our reserves for future policy benefits and claims are inadequate  or there are significant deviations from our pricing assumptions 
we calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future benefit payments to our policyholders and contract holders in accordance with us gaap  which are released as those future obligations are extinguished 
the reserves we establish are estimates  primarily based on actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience  which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
our future financial results depend upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions we have used in pricing our products and determining our reserves 
many factors can affect future experience  including economic  political and social conditions  mortality and morbidity  persistency  inflation  healthcare costs and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation 
therefore  we cannot predict the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual future benefits or the timing of those payments 
health care costs in particular have risen substantially in recent history and may continue to do so 
our medical stop loss products provide coverage for claims exceeding certain dollar thresholds for either individual or aggregate claims  and increased medical costs may result in higher claims 
while we monitor claims costs and 
table of contents changes that may affect future costs  such as medical inflation  changing demographics and changes in the mix of our business  increases in medical costs may exceed our expectations or may not be properly factored into our pricing 
this could adversely affect the results of operations in our benefits segment 
persistency is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next 
for most of our products  actual persistency that is lower than our assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability  especially in the early years of a policy or contract primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract 
in addition  we may need to sell investments at a loss to fund withdrawals 
for some of our life insurance policies  actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability 
if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed  then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products 
in addition  we set prices for our insurance and certain annuity products based upon expected claims and payment patterns  using assumptions for  among other factors  morbidity rates and mortality rates of our policyholders and contract holders 
the long term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions 
for example  if morbidity rates are higher or mortality rates are lower than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under our insurance and certain annuity contracts than we had projected 
our largest exposure to morbidity risk is in our medical stop loss products  which we mitigate through reinsurance 
for example  our specific stop loss business is reinsured for claims above million 
our largest exposure to mortality risk is in our life segment  which we also mitigate through reinsurance 
additionally  a general increase in mortality would be favorable to our income annuities segment  as we may pay fewer benefits than expected 
also in our income annuities segment  we can experience mortality losses on life contingent policies when mortality rates are lower than expected 
we regularly monitor our reserves and review our assumptions 
if we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claims payments  we would be required to increase our reserves and incur income statement charges in the period in which we make that determination  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
there were no significant adjustments to reserves due to inadequacy during or although certain of our products permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or crediting rates during the life of the policy or contract  these changes may not be sufficient to maintain profitability  or may reduce the attractiveness of our products relative to competitors 
moreover  many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or reduce benefits or may limit those changes during the life of the policy or contract 
therefore  significant deviations in experience from our assumptions regarding persistency  mortality and morbidity rates could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
the amount of statutory capital that we have and the amount of statutory capital that we must hold to meet rating agency  regulatory and other requirements can vary significantly from time to time and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of our control  including equity market and credit market conditions and changes in rating agency models 
we conduct the vast majority of our business through our insurance company subsidiaries 
accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for these entities are prescribed by the applicable insurance regulators and the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
the naic has established regulations that provide minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for our insurance company subsidiaries 
the rbc formula for our insurance company subsidiaries establishes minimum capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
in any particular year  statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios may increase or decrease depending on a variety of factors the amount of statutory income or losses generated by our insurance subsidiaries which itself is sensitive to equity market and credit market conditions  the amount of additional capital our insurance 
table of contents subsidiaries must hold to support business growth or to support changes in the mix of business  changes in equity market levels  the value of certain fixed income and equity securities in our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality ratings for the bonds in our investment portfolio  and changes to the rbc formulas 
most of these factors are outside of our control 
our financial strength and credit ratings are significantly influenced by the statutory surplus amounts and rbc ratios of our insurance company subsidiaries 
in addition  rating agencies may implement changes to their internal models that have the effect of increasing or decreasing the amount of statutory capital they believe we should hold 
further  in scenarios of extended periods of very low interest rates  such as those experienced recently  the amount of statutory reserves that we are required to hold may increase  which reduces our statutory surplus 
annually we are required to assess statutory reserve adequacy and as of december   we established cash flow testing reserves of million  which reduced our statutory surplus by approximately million  net of tax 
for further information on our cash flow testing reserves  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
we may face unanticipated losses if we are required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and or deferred sales inducements if there are significant deviations in actual experience or in anticipated assumptions 
deferred policy acquisition costs represent certain costs that vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our products and are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related contracts 
these costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions  certain sales incentives  and other costs such as underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses 
deferred sales inducements represent bonus interest and excess interest mainly on our fixed deferred annuity products  which are deferred and reported in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized as interest credited over the estimated life of the related contracts 
under us gaap  dac and dsi are amortized through income over the lives of the underlying contracts in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits for most of our products 
as of december   we had million of dac and million of dsi 
our amortization of dac and dsi generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments  crediting rates  surrender and other policy and contract charges  mortality  morbidity and maintenance and expense margins 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  crediting rates  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of dac and dsi  resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability 
our assumptions  including those related to expenses  investment returns  credited interest rates  mortality  morbidity  withdrawals or lapse experience among others  are adjusted quarterly to reflect actual experience to date 
for future assumptions  we conduct a study to refine our estimates of future gross profits on an annual basis during the third quarter 
upon completion of this study  we revise our assumptions and update our dac models to reflect our current best estimate 
changes in our actual experience or our expected future experience may result in increased amortization of dac or dsi  which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability 
we regularly review our dac and dsi asset balances to determine if it is recoverable from future income 
the portion of the dac and dsi asset balances deemed to be unrecoverable  if any  is charged to expense in the period in which we make this determination 
for example  if we determine that we are unable to recover dac or dsi from profits over the life of a book of business of insurance policies or annuity contracts  we would be required to recognize the unrecoverable dac or dsi amortization as a current period expense 
for further information on our dac accounting policy  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates deferred policy acquisition costs 

table of contents changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap  which is periodically revised by recognized authorities  including the financial accounting standards board fasb 
in  the fasb issued a revised standard for dac  which limits the costs that are eligible for deferral 
this standard is effective for our fiscal year and will result in more acquisition costs being expensed as incurred  which will be partially offset by a decrease in related amortization expense 
we retrospectively adopted this standard on january  for further discussion on the impacts of adoption  refer to item financial statement footnote significant accounting policies 
in addition  the fasb is developing new accounting standards in an effort to converge us gaap accounting with international accounting principles 
as a part of this effort  new standards are being developed for accounting for insurance contracts  which would measure liabilities for insurance contracts based on the present value of estimated future cash flows to fulfill the contract 
this could change the recognition and measurement of insurance obligations on our statement of financial position and impact the timing of the related income in our results of operations 
the fasb is also drafting a new standard for financial instruments which  as currently proposed  would change the way assets and liabilities classified as financial instruments are recognized and measured  and change the way credit losses for financial assets are measured 
other standards are also being adopted as a part of this convergence project that would also impact our consolidated statements 
if adopted  these accounting standards could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements  and such changes could have an adverse effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations 
a downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength ratings could result in a loss of business 
financial strength ratings  which various ratings organizations publish as measures of an insurance company s ability to meet contract holder and policyholder obligations  are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and our products  and the ability to market our products and our competitive position 
additionally  our structured settlement products are typically purchased during lawsuit settlements for the benefit of injured claimants and the purchase must be approved by the courts  which place significant reliance on financial strength ratings 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings  or the announced potential for a downgrade  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in several ways  including reducing new sales of insurance products  annuities and other investment products  limiting our ability to offer structured settlement products  increasing our cost of capital  adversely affecting our relationships with independent sales intermediaries and our dedicated sales specialists  materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders  requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive  and adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance 
we rely on reinsurance arrangements to help manage our business risks  and failure to perform by the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements may expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate 
we utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances  primarily related to our individual life and group products 
reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders  even when the reinsurer is liable to us 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
the total reinsurance 
table of contents recoverables due from reinsurers was million as of december   of which million was recoverable from our single largest reinsurer 
our reinsurers may be unable or unwilling to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us now or in the future or on a timely basis 
a reinsurer s insolvency  inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reinsurance may not be available  affordable or adequate to protect us against losses 
as part of our overall risk management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments 
while reinsurance agreements generally bind the reinsurer for the life of the business reinsured at generally fixed pricing  market conditions beyond our control can determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection for new business 
in certain circumstances  the price of reinsurance for business already reinsured may also increase 
any decrease in the amount of reinsurance will increase our risk of loss and any increase in the cost of reinsurance will reduce our earnings 
accordingly  we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance  may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms or may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage  which could adversely affect our ability to write future business  offer new products or enter new markets  or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue 
for further discussion on our reinsurance program  see item business reinsurance 
intense competition could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share and profitability 
our businesses are subject to intense competition 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the sale of our products are product features  price  commission structure  marketing and distribution arrangements  brand  reputation  financial strength ratings and service 
many other companies actively compete for sales of deferred and income annuity products  group health and life insurance  including other major insurers  banks  other financial institutions  mutual fund and asset management firms and specialty providers 
in many of our product lines  we face competition from companies that have greater market share or breadth of distribution  offer a broader range of products  services or features  assume a greater level of risk  have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength ratings than we do 
many competitors offer similar products and use similar distribution channels 
the substantial expansion of banks and insurance companies distribution capacities and expansion of product features in recent years have intensified pressure on margins and production levels and have increased the level of competition in many of our product lines  which could make it difficult to achieve our target returns 
our strategies for mitigating risks arising from our day to day operations may prove ineffective resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 
our performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of our day to day business activities  including setting of premium or interest crediting rates  underwriting  claims processing  policy administration and servicing  execution of our investment strategy  financial and tax reporting  marketing and sales efforts  and other activities  many of which are complex 
we also may rely on third parties for such activities 
we seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of or related to these activities through a variety of internal controls  management review processes  and other mechanisms 
however  the occurrence of unforeseen or un contemplated risks  or the occurrence of risks of a greater magnitude than expected  including those arising from a failure in processes  procedures or systems implemented by us or a failure on the part of employees or third parties upon which we rely in this regard  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the occurrence of natural disasters  disease pandemics  terrorism or military actions could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial condition and results of operations are at risk of material adverse effects that could arise from catastrophic mortality and morbidity due to natural disasters  including floods  tornadoes  earthquakes and hurricanes  disease pandemics  terrorism and military actions 
such events could also lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contract holders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations  such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies or deposits into our investment products 
the effectiveness of external parties  including governmental and nongovernmental organizations  in combating the spread and severity of a disease pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets  and a natural disaster or a disease pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster 
these could adversely impact the valuation and performance of our investment portfolio 
further  for products sold through our benefits and life divisions  a localized event that affects one or more of our customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or morbidity claims 
the majority of our operations are located in bellevue  washington 
in the event of a catastrophic event or disaster in this area  our employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time  which may interrupt our business operations and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and may result in limited or no connectivity 
the majority of our employees are equipped to work remotely  however certain duties  such as processing new business applications  may be difficult to perform remotely 
the failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could adversely affect our business 
we use computer systems to store  retrieve  evaluate and use customer and company data and information 
additionally  our computer and information technology systems interface with and rely upon third party systems 
our business is highly dependent on our ability  and the ability of our business partners  to access these systems to perform necessary business functions  including providing insurance quotes  processing premium payments  providing customer support  filing and paying claims and making changes to existing policies 
we also use systems for investment management  financial reporting and data analysis to support our policyholder reserves and other actuarial estimates 
our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not maintain adequate systems  we could experience adverse consequences  including inadequate information on which to base pricing  underwriting and reserving decisions  inadequate information for accurate financial reporting  increases in administrative expenses  the loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  customer  provider and agent disputes  litigation exposure  or regulatory compliance problems  such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations 
systems outages or outright failures would compromise our ability to perform critical functions in a timely manner 
this could hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and harm our ability to conduct business 
in the event of a disaster such as a blackout  a computer virus  a cyber attack  an industrial 
table of contents accident  a natural catastrophe  a terrorist attack or war  our systems may not be available to our employees  customers or business partners for an extended period of time 
if our systems or our data are destroyed or disabled  employees may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time 
our systems could also be subject to similar disruptions due to physical and electronic break ins or other types of unauthorized tampering with our systems 
this may interrupt our business operations and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop  maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 
our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients is critical to the operation of our business  and failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients 
the failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business 
a number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and confidentiality obligations 
for example  the collection and use of patient data in our benefits segment is the subject of national and state legislation  including the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and certain of the activities conducted by our businesses are subject to the privacy regulations of the gramm leach bliley act 
we also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors and clients 
these obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information 
the actions we take to protect confidential information vary by business segment and may include  among other things training and educating our employees regarding our obligations relating to confidential information  actively monitoring our record retention plans and any changes in state or federal privacy and compliance requirements  drafting appropriate contractual provisions into any contract that raises proprietary and confidentiality issues  maintaining secure storage facilities for tangible records  limiting access to electronic information  and in the event of a security breach  providing credit monitoring or other services to affected customers 
in addition  we must develop  implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information 
if we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information  we could experience adverse consequences  including regulatory sanctions  such as penalties  fines and loss of license  as well as loss of reputation and possible litigation 
this could have an adverse impact on our company s image and  therefore  result in lower sales or lapses of existing business 
our business could be interrupted or compromised if we experience difficulties arising from outsourcing relationships 
we outsource certain technology and business functions to third parties  including a significant portion of our investment management and information technology functions  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
when we engage a third party vendor  we perform extensive due diligence on the vendor  including evaluations of quality of service  financial stability  compliance with laws and regulations and appropriate business continuity plans 
however  if we do not maintain an effective outsourcing strategy or third party providers do not perform as contracted  we may experience operational difficulties  increased costs and a loss of business that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 

table of contents our credit facility subjects us to operating and financial covenants on our operations and could limit our ability to grow our business 
we entered into a million revolving credit facility on december   which replaced our previous million facility 
this credit facility also provides access to up to an additional million of financing  subject to the availability of additional commitments 
we rely on the facility as a potential source of liquidity  which could be critical in enabling us to meet our obligations as they come due  particularly during periods when alternative sources of liquidity are limited 
as of december   we had no balance outstanding and we have had no borrowings under this facility since it was originally established 
in connection with this facility  we have agreed to covenants that may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness by our subsidiaries  limit the ability of us and our subsidiaries to create liens and impose certain other operating limitations 
these restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing or take advantage of business opportunities 
furthermore  our credit facility requires us and our insurance subsidiaries to maintain specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
if we are unable to comply with the covenants and ratios in our credit facility  we may be deemed in default under the facility and unable to access it when needed  or we may be required to pay substantial fees or penalties to the lenders to obtain a waiver of any such default 
either development could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
raising additional capital could dilute stockholder ownership in the company and may cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we need liquidity to pay our policyholder benefits  operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our capital stock  and to pay down or replace certain debt obligations as they mature 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to fund liquidity needs  refinance our senior notes or our capital efficient notes cents  satisfy letter of credit or guarantee bond requirements that may be imposed by our clients or by regulators  acquire new businesses or invest in existing businesses  grow our business  otherwise respond to competitive pressures  maintain adequate risk based capital  or maintain our target ratings from rating agencies 
future deterioration of our capital position at a time when we are unable to access the long term debt market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  which may require us to reduce or eliminate future stockholder dividends of our common stock  utilize unused borrowings for general corporate purposes  undertake additional capital management activities  including reinsurance transactions  limit or curtail sales of certain products and or restructure existing products  undertake asset sales or internal asset transfers  and seek temporary or permanent changes to regulatory rules 

table of contents certain of these actions may require regulatory approval and or the approval of counterparties  which are outside of our control or have economic costs associated with them 
actions we might take to access financing may also cause rating agencies to reevaluate our ratings 
further  in connection with the cents offering  we entered into a covenant that may limit our ability to undertake certain additional types of financing to repay or redeem the cents 
any additional capital raised through the sale of equity will dilute each stockholder s ownership percentage in our company and may decrease the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  newly issued securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior or otherwise superior to those of our common stock 
any additional financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us 
without sufficient liquidity  we could be forced to curtail our operations  and our business could suffer 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets may limit our access to capital required to operate our business and maintain desired financial ratios 
these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to grow our business  replace capital withdrawn by customers or raise new capital required by our subsidiaries as a result of volatility in the markets in a timely manner 
as a result  we may be forced to delay raising capital  bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price  which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
as a holding company  symetra financial corporation depends on the ability of its subsidiaries to transfer funds to it to meet its obligations and pay dividends 
symetra is a holding company for its insurance and financial subsidiaries with no significant operations of its own 
its principal sources of cash to meet its obligations and to pay dividends consist of dividends from its subsidiaries and permitted payments under tax sharing agreements with its subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries 
based on our statutory results as of december   our insurance subsidiaries may pay dividends to us of up to million in the aggregate during without obtaining regulatory approval 
competitive pressures generally require our insurance subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings  which are partly based on maintaining certain levels of capital 
these restrictions and other regulatory requirements  such as minimum required risk based capital ratios  affect the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to make dividend payments 
limits on the ability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect our liquidity  including our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and service our debt 
there are a number of other factors that could affect our ability to pay dividends  including the following lack of available cash due to changes in our operating cash flow  capital expenditure requirements  working capital requirements and other cash needs  unexpected or increased operating or other expenses or changes in the timing thereof  restrictions under delaware law or other applicable law on the amount of dividends that we may pay  a decision by our board of directors to modify or revoke its policy to pay dividends  and the other risks described in this section 
significant stockholders may be able to influence the direction of our business 
our principal stockholders  affiliates of white mountains insurance group  ltd 
and berkshire hathaway inc  each beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock as of february  including warrants exercisable for  shares held by affiliates of each of white mountains insurance group  ltd 
and berkshire hathaway inc 
accordingly  they may have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the nomination and election of 
table of contents directors and the determination of the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including amendments to our certificate of incorporation  potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales and other significant corporate transactions 
the interests of our principal stockholders may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock 
risks related to our industry our industry is highly regulated and changes in regulations affecting our businesses may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
our insurance businesses are heavily regulated and are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws and regulated by the insurance departments of the various states in which they are domiciled and licensed 
state laws in the united states grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to various aspects of our insurance businesses  including licensing companies and agents to transact business  calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements  mandating certain insurance benefits  regulating certain premium rates  reviewing and approving policy forms  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  including the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices  distribution arrangements and payment of inducements  establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards  establishing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts  requiring regular market conduct examinations  approving changes in control of insurance companies  restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates  and regulating the types  amounts and valuation of investments 
state insurance regulators and the naic regularly re examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products 
changes in these laws and regulations  or in interpretations thereof  are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our business 
currently  the us federal government does not regulate directly the business of insurance 
however  the dodd frank act created a federal insurance office 
while the office will not directly regulate domestic insurance business  it is tasked with studying the potential efficiency and consequences of federal insurance regulation 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  the results of these studies or other such proposals  if enacted  may have on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  federal legislation and administrative policies in other areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies  including general financial services regulation  securities regulation  pension regulation  privacy regulation  tort reform legislation  and taxation 
many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments 
changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or to distribute our products 

table of contents compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel intensive  and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business 
us federal and state securities laws apply to investment products that are also securities  including variable annuities and variable life insurance policies 
as a result  some of our subsidiaries and the policies and contracts they offer are subject to regulation under these federal and state securities laws 
some of our insurance subsidiaries separate accounts are registered as investment companies under the investment company act of some subsidiaries are registered as broker dealers under the securities exchange act of and are members of  and subject to regulation by finra 
in addition  two of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers under the investment advisers act of these subsidiaries may also be impacted by interpretations and rules created as a result of the dodd frank act 
securities laws and regulations are primarily intended to ensure the integrity of financial markets and to protect investors in the securities markets or investment advisory or brokerage clients 
these laws and regulations grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers  including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business for failure to comply with those laws and regulations 
legal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in our businesses and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation 
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate 
we may become subject to class actions and regulatory actions and we are or may become subject to individual lawsuits relating  among other things  to sales or underwriting practices  payment of contingent or other sales commissions  claims payments and procedures  product design  disclosure  administration  additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis  interest crediting practices  denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers 
plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
such litigation or regulatory investigations may relate to the following escheat practices relating to unclaimed life insurance death benefits have come under increased scrutiny by state insurance regulators 
state insurance regulators are requesting insurance companies to report on their escheat practices and procedures for tracking and identifying claims that should have been but were not paid 
as a result of these investigations  the state insurance regulators are looking to adopt regulations that would require insurance companies to perform regular checks against the social security death master file  as well as require insurance companies to collect more information needed to track policyholders  account holders and beneficiaries 
it is possible that these requests by the state insurance regulators may result in payment to beneficiaries  escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws and changes to the company s escheat practices and procedures 
we have responded to state insurance regulator requests for information and are implementing new processes and procedures to identify claims that were not previously reported 
the insurance industry has also been the focus of increased scrutiny and lawsuits related to retained asset accounts offered to beneficiaries  which offer access to benefits through drafts on interest bearing accounts held by the insurer in lieu of a lump sum payout 
the lawsuits allege that customers were misled about access to and security of these funds  and that insurers unjustly profited through low crediting rates offered on the accounts 
as of december   balances held in our retained asset accounts were million  and we have not been the subject of any inquiries or lawsuits regarding these practices 
annuity sales to seniors continue to be scrutinized by finra and state insurance regulators  and have been the source of industry litigation in situations where annuity sales have allegedly been unsuitable for the seniors financial needs 

table of contents funding services have been viewed unfavorably in the past by consumer advocates and the media and have the potential to be misunderstood by regulators and courts 
this is particularly the case where we offer funding services to payees of our own structured settlement annuities 
we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries  such as information requests  subpoenas  market conduct exams and books and record examinations  from state and federal regulators and other authorities  which may result in fines  recommendations for corrective action or other regulatory actions 
current or future investigations and proceedings could have an adverse effect on our business 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business 
moreover  even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation  regulatory action or investigation  we could suffer significant reputational harm  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions or precedents and industry wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business 
the implementation of the patient protection and affordable care act could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of the health insurance products that we sell 
on march   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  which brought substantial change to the insurance coverage for medical costs 
ppaca directly or indirectly impacts our medical stop loss and limited benefit medical businesses 
a number of state governors have opposed certain of ppaca s provisions  and initiated lawsuits challenging its constitutionality 
these challenges are pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions  including the united states supreme court 
congress has also proposed a number of legislative initiatives  including possible repeal of ppaca 
at this time  it remains unclear whether there will be any changes made to ppaca  including any changes with respect to self insured health plans and  thus  our medical stop loss business 
although our limited benefit medical product is exempt from many of the reforms mandated by ppaca due to its fixed indemnity design  it does not provide minimum essential coverage as defined under ppaca provisions effective in we will continue to monitor the implementation of ppaca and reassess our business strategies accordingly 
potential changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to customers and adversely affect our results of operations 
many of the products that we sell benefit from one or more forms of tax favored status under current federal tax law 
for example  we sell life insurance policies that benefit from the deferral or elimination of taxation on earnings accrued under the policy  as well as permanent exclusion of certain death benefits that may be paid to policyholders beneficiaries 
we also sell annuity contracts that allow the policyholders to defer the recognition of taxable income earned within the contract 
congress has previously considered and may revisit legislation that could make our products less attractive to consumers  including legislation that would reduce or eliminate the benefits derived from the tax deferred nature of life insurance and annuity products 
due in large part to the recent budget crisis affecting many governments  there is an increasing risk that federal and or state tax legislation could be enacted that would result in higher taxes on insurance companies and their policyholders 
although the specific form of any such potential legislation is uncertain  it could include reducing or eliminating some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us or our policyholders 
changes to these favorable tax statuses could adversely affect our sales and lapses of current policies 
in addition  changes in tax laws could increase our company tax liability and income tax expense 
for example  recent federal budget proposals  if enacted  would affect the taxation of life insurance companies and certain life insurance products 
in particular  those proposals include modifying the dividends received deduction 
table of contents for life insurance company separate accounts and expanding the interest expense disallowance for corporate owned life insurance 
if proposals of this type were enacted  our sales could be adversely affected  primarily variable products and boli  and our actual tax expense could increase  reducing earnings 
failures elsewhere in the insurance industry could obligate us to pay assessments through guaranty associations 
when an insurance company becomes insolvent  state insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess other insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to pay obligations to policyholders of the insolvent company  up to the state specific limit of coverage 
the total amount of the assessment is based on the number of insured residents in each state  and each company s portion is based on its proportionate share of premium volume in the relevant lines of business 
the future failure of a large life  health or annuity insurer could trigger assessments which we would be obligated to pay 
further  amounts for historical insolvencies may be assessed over many years  and there can be significant uncertainty around the total obligation for a given insolvency 
in addition  certain states allow us to offset future assessments with premium tax offsets which are estimated and recorded as a corresponding asset 
existing liabilities may not be sufficient to fund the ultimate obligations of a historical insolvency  and we may be required to increase our liability  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  future premium tax offsets may not be realized and we may be required to decrease our asset  which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations
