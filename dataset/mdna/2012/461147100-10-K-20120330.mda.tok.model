item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors and forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains statements relating to possible future events and results that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements can often be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  intends  may  will  should or anticipates or similar terminology 
see part i  item business cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for examples of statements made in this report which may be forward looking statements 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on various assumptions 
although we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  investors and prospective investors are cautioned that such statements are only projections  and there cannot be any assurance that these events or results will occur 
information about the primary risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual future results to differ materially from our historic results or the results described in the forward looking statements made in this report or presented elsewhere by management from time to time are included in part i  item a risk factors 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview this md a should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict and in recent years have become more volatile and  in certain cases  shorter in duration 
because the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential periods of growth or declines in orders and net revenues during each cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of thermal products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  we market our thermostream temperature management systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
while the majority of our orders and net revenues are derived from the ate market  our operating results do not always follow the overall trend in the ate market in any given period 
we believe that these anomalies may be driven by a variety of changes within the ate market  including  for example  changing product requirements  longer time periods between new product offerings by oems and changes in customer buying patterns 
in particular  demand for our mechanical and electrical products  which are sold exclusively within the ate industry  and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by shifts in the competitive landscape  including i customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs and ordering in smaller quantities which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing unit costs  ii the practice of oem manufacturers to specify other suppliers as primary vendors  with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations  iii the role of third party test and assembly houses in the ate market and their requirement of products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost  and iv customer supply line management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors 
these shifts in market practices have had  and may continue to have  varying levels of impact on our operating results  which are difficult to quantify or predict from period to period 
management has taken  and will continue to take  such actions it deems appropriate to adjust our strategies  products and operations to counter such shifts in market practices as they become evident 
net revenues and orders the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location to which the goods are shipped 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers mechanical products thermal products electrical products intersegment sales intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products net revenues from unaffiliated customers net of intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products net revenues from unaffiliated customers us foreign our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  increased million or as compared to this increase consisted of an million or increase in the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our thermal products segment which was offset by decreases in the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical and electrical products segments of million or and million or  respectively 
we believe the decrease in the level of net revenues in our mechanical and electrical products segments during reflects reduced demand within the ate industry  which we began to see reflected in the level of our orders for these segments during the second quarter of we believe the increase in the net revenues of our thermal products segment as compared to the decreases in our other two product segments primarily reflects that this segment has historically lagged our other two product segments in regard to experiencing the impact of both increases and decreases in the levels of demand within the ate industry 
in addition  approximately of this segment s sales are to customers in various industries outside the ate industry where we have experienced recent strength in demand 
total consolidated orders for the year ended december  were million compared to million for for the year ended december   orders for our mechanical  thermal and electrical products segments were million  million and million  respectively  compared to million  million and million for  respectively 
orders from customers in various industries outside the ate industry were million or of total consolidated orders for the year ended december  compared to million or of total consolidated orders for the year ended december  we cannot be certain what the level of our orders or net revenues will be in any future period for any of our product segments 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued business restructuring initiatives in response to the significant decline in our orders and net revenues during and early  we took actions to reduce our cost structure  including facility closures  workforce reductions and salary and benefits reductions 
we consider some of the actions we took to be temporary in nature  such as certain salary and benefits reductions for current employees 
at the time we took these temporary actions  it was generally our intent to restore all or a portion of the reduced salary and benefits in future periods when our results of operations and our cash flows improved sufficiently so as to allow us to do so 
any such restoration impacts the ultimate level of savings which result from our restructuring actions 
there were no additional restructuring actions taken in either or effective january   we restored all of the temporary salary reductions we implemented in and for our domestic employees  with the exception of the salary of our executive chairman  which was restored to approximately of its full reinstated level  reflecting a voluntary continued reduction in his salary 
also on this date  we restored the fees paid to our board of directors  which had been reduced by approximately 
effective april   we restored the k plan discretionary matching contribution for all domestic employees and the temptronic profit sharing contributions which had been suspended for most of these employees at the beginning of there are no other temporary actions remaining to be restored 
acquisition on january   temptronic corporation acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of thermonics  inc thermonics  a division of test enterprises  inc  pursuant to the asset purchase agreement dated december  thermonics is engaged in the business of designing  manufacturing  selling and distributing temperature forcing systems used in the testing of various products under temperature controlled situations 
the acquisition of the thermonics business will broaden the product line of intest s thermal products division 
the purchase price for the assets was approximately million in cash  plus the assumption of specified liabilities  including trade payables and certain customer contract obligations 
we expect to complete the purchase price allocation for this transaction by june  for further discussion of the acquisition  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is affected by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell most of our products to semiconductor manufacturers and third party test and assembly houses end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
our thermal products segment also sells into a variety of other industries including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics and defense industries 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december  and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were and  respectively  and our sales of thermal products in other industries outside the ate industry as a percentage of net revenues were and  respectively 
oem sales generally have a lower gross margin than end user sales  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we have also continued to experience demands from our oem customers supply line managers to reduce our sales prices to them 
if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs  these pricing pressures will continue to reduce our gross and operating margins 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
in addition  some of the products manufactured by our thermal products segment are used in industries outside of the semiconductor industry  including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics and defense industries 
the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of that segment 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense operating income other income earnings before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million or 
this increase consisted of an million or increase in the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our thermal products segment which was offset by decreases in the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical and electrical products segments of million or and million or  respectively 
we believe the increase in our consolidated net revenues during primarily reflects the factors previously discussed in the overview 
during the year ended december   our net revenues from customers in the us increased while our net revenues from foreign customers decreased  respectively  as compared to the same period in the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the decrease in net revenues from foreign customers was less than 
gross margin 
gross margin was for each of the years ended december  and our fixed operating costs were relatively unchanged at percent of net revenues for both and however  in absolute dollar terms  these costs increased  during as compared to the  increase in the absolute dollar value of our fixed operating costs primarily reflects higher salary and benefits expense as a result of increased levels of staff in our thermal products segment  and  to a lesser extent  annual salary adjustments for current staff in all of our product segments 
the increase in salary and benefits expense was partially offset by reductions in facility related costs as a result of the relocation of two of our domestic operations to smaller facilities during the first quarter of during  our component material costs represented of net revenues compared to of net revenues in this decrease in our component material costs as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects changes in product and customer mix 
both our direct labor costs and obsolescence expense were relatively unchanged as a percentage of net revenues for the year ended december  as intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to the same period in  although our obsolescence expense increased  in absolute dollar terms during as compared to the increase in the absolute dollar amount of our obsolescence expense primarily reflects the reduced demand in the second half of in the ate industry  as previously discussed in the overview  which resulted in an increase in the amount of items being written off as a result of applying our objective obsolescence and excess criteria 
selling expense 
selling expense was million for each of the years ended december  and increases in salaries and benefits expense and travel  primarily reflecting additional sales staff and increased international travel  were offset by decreases in commissions  reflecting changes in product and customer mix 
to a lesser extent there was also a reduction in accruals for product warranty claims in as compared to  reflecting positive trends in our historical warranty experience 
engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of  or 
the increase in engineering and product development expense primarily reflects higher legal fees related to our intellectual property  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in spending on materials used in research and development projects 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  an increase of  or 
the increase primarily reflects higher salary and benefits expense as well as costs associated with our recent acquisition of thermonics and the filing of our shelf registration statement 
the increase in salary and benefits expense is primarily due to the hiring of additional staff as well as annual salary adjustments for current staff 
other income 
other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  the increase primarily represents a reduction in interest expense as a result of repaying the notes payable to stockholder during the fourth quarter of this increase was partially offset by a reduction in gains on the sale of fully depreciated machinery and equipment in as compared to income tax expense benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared with income tax expense of  for the same period in on a quarterly basis  we record income tax expense or benefit based on the expected annualized effective tax rate for the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses 
during the past several years  due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we had recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believed it was more likely than not that we would not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
during  we reversed million of the valuation allowance which had been recorded against the deferred tax assets of these operations 
the reversal of this amount of the valuation allowance was based on our current assessment that it is now more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize these assets in the near future 
some of the key factors we considered in making our assessment included our profitability in both and and our level of certainty with regard to our forecasts of near term future profitability for the operations to which these assets relate 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by operations of million for the same period in during  there was a million increase in our deferred tax assets as a result of reversing a significant portion of the valuation allowance against these assets 
the increase in net cash provided by operations in as compared to primarily reflects an increase of  in accounts receivable during as compared to a decrease of  in in addition  restricted certificates of deposit decreased  during compared to an increase of  in these assets during restricted certificates of deposit are pledged certificates of deposit which support letters of credit that have been issued as security deposits under the various operating leases for facilities we occupy 
to a lesser extent  we also experienced a positive impact on our net cash provided by operations from an increase in accrued rent and customer deposits during as compared to intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the positive impact on our net cash provided by operations from the changes in these items was partially offset by decreases in the amount of change in certain of our accrued expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  accrued wages increased only  from december  to december  compared to an increase of million for the year ended december  this primarily reflects that during both and we accrued profit based bonuses on our positive results 
these bonuses are not paid out until the first quarter of the year following the year in which they are accrued 
there were no similar bonuses accrued during as we had a net loss for the full year 
accordingly  there were no accrued profit based bonuses on the balance sheet at the end of finally  other current liabilities decreased  during the year ended december  as compared to an increase of  during the year ended december   reflecting a decrease in accrued repairs during purchases of property and equipment were  for the year ended december  these purchases primarily represent leasehold improvements and other equipment purchased as a result of the relocation of two of our domestic facilities during the first quarter of we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures for  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we may make such purchases as we deem necessary and appropriate 
during the third quarter of  we terminated our secured credit facility 
this credit facility had provided for maximum borrowings of  while this facility was in place  we had not used it to borrow any funds 
our usage consisted of the issuance of two letters of credit in the face amounts of  and  respectively 
these letters of credit were issued as security deposits under two of our operating leases 
we paid a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
at the time this facility was terminated  the  letter of credit that had been issued under this facility had already been terminated  as the lease in connection with which it had been issued ended in february the  letter of credit that had been issued under this facility was converted to a standalone letter of credit which is secured by a pledged certificate of deposit 
on april  and november   two additional letters of credit were issued in the face amounts of  and  respectively 
these letters of credit are supported by separate pledged certificates of deposit that were not a part of our secured credit facility 
on may   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for the offering  from time to time  of securities to be issued by us 
the shelf registration statement will allow us to raise capital from the offering of up to million of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  debt securities and or units  conducted in one or more offerings while the shelf registration statement is effective 
the specific terms of any particular securities that we may offer will be determined at the time of such offering and will be described in a separately filed prospectus supplement at the time of such offering 
the maximum amount of securities offered and sold under the registration statement during any period of twelve months immediately prior to and including such sale  may not exceed one third of the aggregate market value of the common equity held by non affiliates 
an offering under this registration statement would provide us with increased financial flexibility 
proceeds may be used for possible acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products that are complementary to our existing businesses or for other general corporate purposes  including working capital 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
during january  we used million of our cash to close on the acquisition of thermonics 
we currently expect our cash and cash equivalents and projected future cash flow to be sufficient to support our short term working capital requirements 
we do not currently have any available credit facilities under which we can borrow to help fund our working capital requirements 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to obtain any credit facilities or under what terms such credit facilities would be available 
new or recently adopted accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the charges for excess and obsolete inventory that we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of goodwill  intangible and long lived assets goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  on a reporting unit basis  or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based upon a discounted cash flow approach  and the market approach which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based upon comparable market multiples 
this fair value is then reconciled to our market capitalization at year end with an appropriate control premium 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions including the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums  discount rate  terminal growth rates  forecasts of revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  depreciation  amortization and capital expenditures 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
during the goodwill impairment assessment  we perform a step i test to identify potential impairment  in which the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its book value 
if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a step ii test is performed in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   goodwill was million 
during  we did not record any impairment charges related to our goodwill 
indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of an intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   indefinite lived intangible assets were  during  we did not record any impairment charges related to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued long lived assets  which consist of finite lived intangible assets and property and equipment  are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the cash flow estimates used to determine the impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time 
at december   finite lived intangibles and long lived assets were million 
during  we did not record any impairment charges related to our long lived assets 
income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
during the past several years  due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we had recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believed it was more likely than not that we would not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
during  we reversed million of the valuation allowance which had been recorded against the deferred tax assets of these operations 
the reversal of this amount of the valuation allowance was based on our current assessment that it is now more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize these assets in the near future 
some of the key factors we considered in making our assessment included our profitability in both and and our level of certainty with regard to our forecasts of near term future profitability for the operations to which these assets relate 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december   accrued warranty was  and we recorded charges related to product warranty of  for the year then ended 
off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended december  that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our interests
