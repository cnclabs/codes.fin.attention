item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements  included elsewhere in this filing 
except where otherwise indicated or where the context is clear  the portfolio statistics in item of this form k represent or are calculated from our carry value for financial reporting purposes before depreciation and amortization 
with respect to our loan portfolio  we have adjusted our carry value to exclude a million general loss reserve 
when we use the term we  us  our or the company we mean caplease  inc and its majority owned subsidiaries 
all interests in our properties are held through special purpose entities which are separate and distinct legal entities 
overview we are a reit that primarily owns and manages single tenant commercial real estate properties subject to long term leases to high credit quality tenants 
we focus on properties that are subject to a net lease  or a lease that requires the tenant to pay all or substantially all property operating expenses  such as utilities  real estate taxes  insurance and routine maintenance 
we also have made and expect to continue to make investments in single tenant properties where the owner has exposure to property operating expenses when we determine we can sufficiently underwrite that exposure and isolate a predictable cash flow 
in addition to our portfolio of owned properties  we have a modest portfolio of first mortgage loans and other debt investments on single tenant properties 
that debt portfolio was reduced significantly during as a result of our sale of the assets and associated liabilities comprising our cdo  as well as the individual sale of certain other loans and securities 
while the focus of our investment activity is expected to remain the ownership of real properties  we may continue to make debt investments from time to time on an opportunistic basis in the future 
as a result of lease non renewals  we have classified three properties as multi tenant properties  as each is no longer leased primarily by a single tenant 
as of december   we had an approximately billion investment portfolio  including billion of owned properties and billion of loans and other debt investments 
our primary business objective is to generate stable  long term and attractive returns based on the spread between the yields generated by our assets and the cost of financing our portfolio 
we believe that our focus on assets leased to high credit quality tenants subject to long term leases will provide us with a stable and predictable stream of cash flows that will support our business and the payment of dividends to our stockholders for the foreseeable future 
the principal sources of our revenues are rental income on our owned real properties and interest income from our debt investments loans and securities 
in order to grow our revenues  we will be primarily dependent on our ability to add new assets to our portfolio 
we are also intensely focused on growing revenues by re letting vacant space within our portfolio 
as of december   the occupancy rate in our owned property portfolio was with virtually all of the vacant space being in our office property in johnston  rhode island and one of the two office buildings in omaha  nebraska 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when and on what terms we will be able to re let properties that are or may become vacant in our portfolio 
the principal sources of our expenses are interest expense on our assets financed  depreciation expense on our real properties  general and administrative expenses and property expenses net of expense recoveries 
with the exception of our credit agreement with wells fargo bank  all of our outstanding debt is currently fixed rate and  therefore  the interest expense we pay is not subject to fluctuation based on changes in market interest rates 
our credit agreement with wells fargo bank is floating rate debt and  therefore  the interest expense we pay is expected to increase if interest rates  in particular the one month libor rate  increase 
the average remaining lease term on our owned properties is approximately years  although we have some leases that are scheduled to mature over the next few years 
we are subject to the risk that our tenants do not renew their leases at maturity and that we are unable to promptly re let the property  or that the terms of renewal or re letting may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms  any of which could result in a reduction in our revenues and an increase in our property operating costs 
we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
our overall portfolio leverage  expressed as a percentage of our total debt to our total assets before depreciation and amortization on owned properties and with other minor adjustments  was approximately as of december  our leverage ratios by segment as of december  were approximately for the owned properties segment and for the debt investments segment 
see liquidity and capital resources leverage below for information about our use of leverage ratios and how we compute them 
we expect our leverage level to continue to decrease over time  primarily as a result of scheduled principal amortization on our debt and lower or no leverage on new asset acquisitions 
during  the focus of our portfolio activity was on continuing the portfolio growth momentum we started in and continuing to reduce our leverage 
during  we purchased two single tenant properties for a total purchase price of million  completed the development of a build to suit project with a total investment of million  and commenced another build to suit project with an expected total investment of million 
we also reduced our debt obligations by million  and brought down our leverage level by basis points to our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
through non recourse debt  we seek to limit the overall company exposure in the event we default on the debt to the amount we have invested in the asset or assets financed 
we also had million of recourse debt obligations outstanding as of december   including million outstanding under our credit agreement with wells fargo bank which is scheduled to mature in july we also hold certain assets unencumbered by debt and expect to continue to do so in the future 
we will be required to repay or refinance our debt obligations at maturity  which we expect  although cannot provide any assurance  that we will be able to do 
to the extent we are unable to refinance debt obligations  we may rely on a combination of cash on hand  cash from asset sales  and cash from future debt or equity capital raises to fund the liquidity needed to repay the obligations 
our ability to refinance debt  sell assets and or raise capital on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
we have two debt obligations scheduled to mature or potentially come due during  comprised of million of non recourse mortgage notes on our three nestl properties maturing in august and million of convertible senior notes that may be put to us by the holders in october 
business environment the performance of our existing portfolio and our ability to add new assets will continue to be impacted by market conditions 
commercial real estate market conditions are improving  although various signs of weakness still persist reflecting the weak us economy 
for example  delinquency rates on commercial real estate loans remains at historic highs  which has impacted the amount and terms of credit available for new transactions 
further  overall transaction volumes remain lower compared to historic norms and interest rates remain at historic lows  which have driven significant competition for new investment opportunities 
we cannot provide any assurance as to when and at what yields and other terms we will be able to continue to add new assets to our portfolio 
in addition  while rents and property values have been recovering in some markets  weakness and uncertainty persists  particularly in those markets hardest hit by the recent downturn 
we have a series of leases maturing over the next several years and commercial real estate conditions in the relevant markets at lease maturity will have a significant impact on our ability to retain tenants or re let vacant properties promptly and on favorable terms as leases mature 
we also have a series of non recourse mortgages on our owned properties maturing over the next several years and lending for commercial real estate transactions remains uneven and muted  which could impact our ability to sell properties and refinance maturing debt on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to execute on our business plan  including to add new assets to our portfolio and support additional investments in our existing assets  will continue to be impacted by capital market conditions 
the stock market in general and the market price of our common stock in particular continue to be volatile 
we cannot make any assurance that capital markets will be favorable to us at any time 
application of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of our accounting policies that are most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
impairment on owned real properties 
we are required under gaap to review our owned properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the evaluation includes estimating and reviewing anticipated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset 
if such cash flows are less than the asset s carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized to earnings to the extent by which the asset s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value 
estimating future cash flows is highly subjective and includes an evaluation of factors such as the anticipated cash flows from the property  which may include rent from current leases in place and projected future leases  estimated capital expenditures  and an estimate of proceeds to be realized upon sale of the property 
our estimates could differ materially from actual results 
we recorded impairment losses on our owned properties of million in and a gain on debt extinguishment of million related to the transfer of the same property to the lender and million in including million on the write down to estimated fair value of the vacant property in johnston  rhode island and million on the sale of one property during and a second property sold during 
we did not record any impairment losses on our owned properties during impairment of loan investments 
we are required under gaap to periodically evaluate each of our loan investments for possible impairment 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  our impairment analysis includes both a general reserve component on performing loans and an asset specific component on loans where we have deemed it probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
significant judgment is required in the analysis of each component  including under the general reserve component making estimates of the likelihood of default and lease rejection given the credit characteristics of the tenant  and estimates of stressed collateral values and potential bankruptcy claim recoveries  and under the asset specific component evaluating factors such as the status of the loans ie  current or expected payment or other defaults  the credit quality of the underlying tenants  the present value of expected future cash flows on the loans  the fair market value of our collateral  and the amount and status of any senior debt 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
as of december   we had a general loan loss reserve of million established in and no asset specific loan loss reserves 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate 
we are required under gaap to allocate the purchase price of rental real estate acquired to the following based on fair values acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of above market and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained about each property as a result of our due diligence activities and other market data  and utilize various valuation methods  such as estimated cash flow projections utilizing appropriate discount and capitalization rates  estimates of replacement costs  and available market information 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant the dark value 
above market and below market lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease 
fair market lease rates are measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market rate renewal options for below market leases 
in computing present value  we consider the costs which would need to be invested to achieve the fair market lease rates 
we use a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of base rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases  and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to base rental revenue over the remaining initial terms plus the terms of any below market renewal options of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include in place leases and tenant relationships which are valued based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered by management in its analysis of in place lease values include an estimate of the dark value of the property  carrying costs during the hypothetical expected time it would take management to find a tenant to lease the space for the existing lease term a lease up period considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
management estimates carrying costs  including such factors as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses during the expected lease up period  considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  management considers leasing commissions and other related expenses 
characteristics considered by management in valuing tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the anticipated life of the relationships 
through december   we have assigned no value to tenant relationships on any of our acquisitions 
commercial mortgage backed securities 
we are required under gaap to estimate the fair value of our securities investments quarterly 
management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs 
the primary inputs evaluated by management are broker quotations  collateral values  subordination levels and liquidity of the security 
our estimates of fair value are subject to significant variability based on market conditions  including interest rates and credit spreads 
once we estimate fair value  we are then required under gaap to assess whether any unrealized losses on securities below our carry value reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary 
if an other than temporarily impaired security is intended to be sold or required to be sold prior to the recovery of its carrying amount  the full amount of the impairment loss is charged to earnings 
otherwise  losses on the security must be separated into two categories  the portion which is considered credit loss  which is charged to earnings  and the portion due to other factors  which is charged to other comprehensive income loss  a component of balance sheet equity 
significant judgment is required in this analysis 
in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider whether the decline is due to factors such as changes in interest rates or credit spreads indicator of temporary decline or credit rating downgrades on the securities or credit defaults on the underlying collateral assets indicator of an other than temporary decline 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers a variety of factors including the financial condition and near term prospects of the credit  including credit rating of the security and the underlying tenant and an estimate of the likelihood and expected timing of any default  whether we expect to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost  current market conditions  expected cash flows from the underlying collateral and an estimate of underlying collateral values  and subordination levels within the securitization pool 
these estimates are highly subjective and could differ materially from actual results 
we recorded other than temporary impairment losses on our cmbs securities of  in  million in  and million in stock based compensation 
pursuant to our stock incentive plan  we have made and expect to continue to make awards of common stock to our employees with vesting subject to attainment of performance criteria 
under applicable accounting guidance  we are required to estimate the probability of vesting of these shares quarterly and recognize expense generally equal to the fair market value of the shares awarded on the grant date for any shares deemed probable to vest over the period the employee is required to perform services to receive the shares 
we base our estimates of probability on an assessment of our actual results against the relevant performance criteria 
these estimates may change over time as our actual results against the criteria are re assessed 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the expense we recognize

total revenue was basically unchanged at million in  from in  as an increase in rental revenue and tenant reimbursements was offset by a decrease in interest income 
rental revenue and tenant reimbursements  in the aggregate  increased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the addition of the property leased to cooper tire rubber company in december  the property leased to michelin north america  inc in may  the property leased to a subsidiary of amec plc in june  and the property leased to a subsidiary of lowe s companies  inc in november interest income decreased million  or  to million during  primarily as a result of lower balances on debt investments and the sale of the cdo on september  expenses 
total expenses decreased million  or  to million  as a decrease in interest expense was largely offset by an increase in property expenses and depreciation expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  from million 
the decrease in the period resulted primarily from million of lower interest expense on the cdo due to lower debt outstanding and the sale of the cdo on september   million of lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings resulting from lower borrowings and lower effective borrowing rate in the period  million of lower interest expense on the secured term loan due to lower borrowings outstanding  and million of lower interest expense on convertible debt due to repurchases of the convertible debt 
interest expense on property mortgages was million higher as interest expense on the new mortgages on the cooper tire rubber company  amec plc and lowe s companies  inc properties was partially offset by principal paydowns on other property mortgage debt obligations 
the company s average balance outstanding and effective financing rate under floating rate borrowings was approximately million at during the period average one month libor of  compared with approximately million at during the period average one month libor of 
market interest rates remained low during but we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future

the net amount of property expenses we incurred in net of tenant reimbursements was million  compared to million in general and administrative expense of million in  was basically unchanged from million in general and administrative expense stock based compensation increased million  or  to million 
the increase was primarily a result of higher share prices year over year  which primarily impacted the value of prior year performance share grants that do not price until the eligible vesting year 
as of december   million of unvested shares fair value at the grant dates is expected to be charged to our consolidated statement of operations ratably over the remaining vesting period through march assuming vesting criteria are satisfied 
as of december   we have not yet commenced expense accrual related to the following number of share awards because the applicable performance criteria have not yet been determined  restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in   restricted shares made in and  restricted shares made in depreciation and amortization expense on real property increased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the addition of the property leased to cooper tire rubber company in december  the property leased to michelin north america  inc in may  the property leased to a subsidiary of amec plc in june  and the property leased to a subsidiary of lowe s companies  inc in november other gains losses

comparison of year ended december  to the year ended december the following discussion compares our operating results for the year ended december  to the comparable period in revenue 
total revenue decreased million  or  to million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in rental revenue and interest income 
rental revenue and tenant reimbursements  in the aggregate  decreased million  or  to million  primarily reflecting the vacancy of our property in johnston  rhode island during the fourth quarter of interest income decreased million  or  to million during  primarily as a result of lower loan balances and lower interest rates on cash balances 
other revenue decreased million  or  to million  from million  primarily reflecting the lease termination payment we received on the omaha  nebraska properties during expenses

funds from operations funds from operations  or ffo  is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe ffo is a useful additional measure of our performance because it facilitates an understanding of our operating performance after adjustment for real estate depreciation  a non cash expense which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
in addition  we believe that ffo provides useful information to the investment community about our financial performance as compared to other reits  since ffo is generally recognized as an industry standard for measuring the operating performance of an equity reit 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or earnings per share determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
since all companies and analysts do not calculate ffo in a similar fashion  our calculation of ffo may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit which defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on depreciable real estate  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the following table reconciles our net income loss allocable to common stockholders to ffo for the years ended december   december  and december  year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss allocable to common stockholders   add deduct non controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries depreciation and amortization expense on real property  depreciation and amortization expense on discontinued operations gain loss on property sales  provision for loss on property investment  provision for loss on property investment on discontinued operations funds from operations    weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted weighted average number of op units outstanding weighted average number of common shares and op units outstanding  diluted    net loss per common share  basic and diluted funds from operations per share liquidity and capital resources short term liquidity 
we define our short term liquidity as our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet day to day operating expenses and material cash commitments over the next twelve months 
our primary sources of short term liquidity are available cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  and a portion of the cash proceeds from issuances of debt and equity capital 
we may also use revolving loan borrowings under our credit agreement with wells fargo bank to finance  likely on a short term basis  a portion of our new investment activity 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as of february   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our sources of short term liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  including the payment of our dividend 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis  and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in order to comply with the distribution requirements of the code and to avoid federal income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
we declared total cash dividends of per share of common stock during the year ended december   including per share in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters 
we declared a cash dividend of per share of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock in each of the first  second  third and fourth quarters of our dividend policy is subject to revision at the discretion of our board of directors 
all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our cash available for distribution  our funds from operations  our maintenance of reit status  market conditions and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
while we believe we will be able to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  the following are the primary factors that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our plans payment defaults on our assets which we expect could be triggered primarily in the event of the bankruptcy of the underlying tenant or tenants  unexpected capital expenditures on our owned properties  margin calls on our wells fargo bank credit agreement  or margin calls on any future risk management transactions 
long term liquidity 
we define our long term liquidity as our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet cash demands and commitments beyond the next months  including balloon payments on our debt obligations and capital expenditures on our owned properties 
our primary sources of long term liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operations  cash from long term financings on our asset investments and issuances of debt and equity capital 
we may continue to selectively sell assets to allow us to generate additional long term liquidity 
we believe that our various sources of long term liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
our primary long term liquidity requirement is repayment of our debt obligations 
we intend generally to manage our debt maturities by refinancing or repaying the related debt at maturity 
we expect to utilize a combination of i cash on hand  ii cash from sales of assets which may include the collateral for the debt  and iii cash from future debt or equity capital raises  to fund any liquidity needed to satisfy these obligations 
these actions  however  may not enable us to generate sufficient liquidity to satisfy our borrowings and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to refinance or repay our debt obligations as they come due 
our ability to refinance debt  sell assets and or raise capital on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
see item a risk factors risks relating to borrowings our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in this annual report on form k 
we have two recourse debt obligations that are scheduled to mature or potentially come due over the next two years 
our convertible senior notes can be put to us at the option of the note holders for a repurchase price of of the principal amount of the notes in october and our credit agreement with wells fargo bank is scheduled to mature in july see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured obligations and the credit agreement with wells fargo bank is a secured borrowing agreement 
with respect to the convertible notes  we have through various repurchase transactions reduced the principal amount of notes outstanding to million as of december  from million at original issuance in october 
to the extent the notes are put to us in october  we intend to repay or refinance that obligation 
with respect to the wells fargo bank credit agreement  the principal amount of the debt is scheduled to decline modestly over time until maturity as we receive principal payments on the assets financed and apply a portion of that principal to the outstanding debt 
we then intend to repay or refinance which may include extending the remaining obligation at or prior to the maturity date in july while we believe we will be successful in either refinancing or repaying these obligations at or prior to maturity  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to do so 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing these obligations  we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the debt in full at maturity 
our failure to do so is a default under the debt and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results in a variety of ways 
for example  if we default under the wells fargo bank credit agreement  the bank could foreclose on the related collateral causing us to lose some of our assets 
wells fargo bank and the convertible note holders also would have general recourse against our company if we default in our obligations to them 
in addition  each of these obligations is cross defaulted with the other  meaning that a default under one obligation could result in the other lender accelerating the maturity of our obligations to them 
we have various non recourse mortgage debt obligations that are scheduled to mature in the future  including million of mortgage debt on the nestl properties scheduled to mature in august see the schedule of mortgage note maturities included at note in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in connection with the maturity of our mortgage debt obligations  we intend to evaluate a variety of alternatives with respect to our investment in the subject property  including refinancing the debt  utilizing cash on hand and other sources of liquidity to repay the mortgage debt  and selling the property 
if we are unsuccessful with one or more of these alternatives  we could convey the property to the lender to satisfy in full our obligations under the non recourse debt 
related to the mortgage debt on the nestl properties  in addition to evaluating a potential refinance or repayment of the debt  we are evaluating alternatives for restructuring the debt with the lender  including extending the loan or making a variety of loan modifications such as permanently or temporarily reducing debt service payments 
the restructuring alternatives we consider will be influenced by whether we renew the terms of the leases or subleases at the properties or re let the properties to new tenants and the economic terms of any such leases 
the existing leases are scheduled to expire in december  and we currently expect to renew the leases at two of the three properties within the next few months 
we do not expect to renew the lease at the third property and are currently marketing that property for re let or sale 
our mortgage debt obligations are non recourse and not cross defaulted with our other debt obligations  and therefore  we do not believe default of any of our mortgage debt obligations will threaten the viability of our company  although it could result in us losing all or some of our remaining investment in the property 
as an owner of commercial real estate  we are required to make capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our properties 
we expect the majority of these expenditures will be made as the leases mature and we renew existing leases or find new tenants to occupy the property 
any estimates we make of expected capital expenditures are highly subjective and actual amounts we spend may differ materially and will be impacted by a variety of factors  including market conditions which are beyond our control 
we may be required to incur additional debt  sell assets and or raise capital to generate the liquidity needed to pay for capital expenditures on our properties  and our ability to do so on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
our ability to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements could be materially adversely affected by capital expenditures we make on our owned properties 
share repurchase program during august  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase in the aggregate up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the program permits us to purchase shares through a variety of methods  including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  in accordance with applicable securities laws 
it does not obligate us to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation 
the timing and extent to which we repurchase our shares will depend upon a variety of factors  including market conditions  our liquidity  and regulatory requirements 
during the quarter ended december   we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of common stock through the above program at an average price of per share  utilizing an aggregate of million of cash on hand 
during the year ended december   we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of common stock through the above program at an average price of per share  utilizing an aggregate of million of cash on hand 
sources of capital general 
we intend to continue to raise additional capital from time to time to enable us to continue to implement our growth strategy 
our ability to raise capital is influenced by market conditions  and we cannot assure you that conditions for raising capital will be favorable for us at any time 
shelf registration statement 
we have a shelf registration statement on form s file no 
on file and effective with the securities and exchange commission which we expect to utilize to issue public equity or debt capital from time to time in the future 
pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we may issue and sell publicly preferred stock  common stock  and debt securities  or any combination of such securities  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate amount of million 
we utilized our shelf registration statement to issue common equity capital during the second quarter of specifically  on april   we issued  shares of common stock in a public offering at a price to the public of per share 
then  on may   we issued an additional  shares of common stock as part of such public offering  as a result of the underwriters partially exercising the over allotment option 
inclusive of the over allotment option  we raised net proceeds of million  after the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses 
through december   we have used a total of million of the proceeds from the offering  with million used to fund purchases of or improvements to owned properties  million used to reduce outstanding indebtedness and million used to repurchase our common stock 
as of december   we had remaining availability of million under our shelf registration statement  and we may offer and sell any combination of common stock  preferred stock and or senior or subordinated debt securities up to such amount from time to time 
the availability under our shelf registration statement includes an aggregate of  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock reserved for sale under the brinson patrick sales agreement described below  and an aggregate of  shares of common stock reserved for sale under the merrill lynch sales agreement described below 
atm offering 
we have implemented an at the market offering program as defined in rule of the securities act of  as amended  which may be utilized by us from time to time to sell shares of our common stock and series a preferred stock and increase liquidity 
we have two separate sales agents for our at the market offering program  brinson patrick securities corporation and merrill lynch  pierce fenner smith incorporated 
we are not currently selling shares through the at the market offering program  although we reserve the right to elect to do so in our sole discretion at any time in the future 
our sales agreement with brinson patrick securities corporation permits us to issue and sell through brinson patrick  from time to time  shares of our common stock and series a preferred stock  and brinson patrick has agreed to use its best efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and on the terms set forth therein 
our board of directors initially authorized the sale of up to  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to the sales agreement with brinson patrick from time to time 
through december   we have sold  shares of common stock and  shares of series a preferred stock pursuant to the agreement with brinson patrick 
we are not obligated to sell any shares pursuant to the agreement and we may start and stop selling shares pursuant to the program at any time in our sole discretion 
we must pay brinson patrick a commission of of the gross sales price per share sold 
our sales agreement with merrill lynch  pierce fenner smith incorporated authorizes us to issue and sell  from time to time  up to  shares of common stock through or to merrill lynch  and merrill lynch has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to sell such shares during the term of the agreement and on the terms set forth therein 
we may sell our common stock to merrill lynch as principal for its own account at prices agreed upon at the time of sale 
through december   we have sold a total of  shares of common stock pursuant to our sales agreement with merrill lynch 
we are not obligated to sell any shares pursuant to the agreement and we may start and stop selling shares pursuant to the program at any time in our sole discretion

dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
in march  we implemented a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  which may be utilized by us from time to time to sell shares of our common stock and increase liquidity 
we are not currently issuing new shares through the plan  although we reserve the right to elect to do so in our sole discretion at any time in the future 
the plan allows interested stockholders to reinvest all or a portion of their cash dividends in shares of our common stock and to make monthly purchases of our common stock generally up to a maximum of  unless a higher amount is approved by us in our sole discretion 
shares purchased through the plan may be either i newly issued by us which may be sold at a discount of up to off of the average of the high and low sales prices on the applicable investment date or ii purchased by the plan administrator in the open market  at our discretion 
during the year ended december   we issued  shares of common stock through the plan at a price of per share 
during the year ended december   we issued shares of common stock through the plan at a price of per share 
as of december   we have reserved an aggregate of  shares of common stock for future issuance pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
leverage we rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns 
leverage also exposes us to a variety of risks which are discussed in more detail in this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
in reviewing and analyzing our debt  we look at a variety of financial metrics such as our leverage ratios  weighted average and individual interest rates on the debt  weighted average and individual maturity dates and scheduled principal amortization and balloon balances due at maturity 
we also evaluate a variety of subjective factors such as present and expected future market conditions 
leverage ratios are a widely used financial measure by the real estate investment community  especially for reits 
we measure our leverage ratios by dividing total debt by total assets  as adjusted 
we measure total assets  as adjusted  at historical cost before depreciation and amortization on owned properties 
therefore  our leverage ratios do not account for any fluctuations in value  up or down  that may have occurred since we acquired our owned properties 
other companies including other reits may compute leverage ratios in a different manner and  therefore  our leverage ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following table sets forth the computation of our overall portfolio leverage ratio as of december  and december  dollars in thousands 
dec  dec  debt mortgages on real estate investments   collateralized debt obligations  principal held by cdo trustee pending distribution  credit agreement   secured term loan   convertible senior notes   other long term debt   total debt   assets total assets   accumulated depreciation and amortization on owned properties intangible liabilities on real estate investments  principal held by cdo trustee pending distribution  prepaid expenses and deposits   accrued rental income   deferred rental income debt issuance costs  net   other  total assets  as adjusted   leverage total debt total assets  as adjusted the following table sets forth the computation of our leverage ratios by segment as of december  dollars in thousands 
mortgage secured term credit agreement in thousands debt loan debt debt total debt investment leverage owned properties     debt investments     represents our carry value for financial reporting purposes before depreciation and amortization on owned properties 
the carry value of our debt investments has been adjusted to exclude a general loss reserve 
we expect our leverage level to continue to decrease over time  primarily as a result of scheduled principal amortization on our debt and lower or no leverage on new asset acquisitions 
our portfolio financing strategy is to finance our assets with long term fixed rate debt as soon as practicable after we invest  generally on a secured  non recourse basis 
through non recourse debt  we seek to limit the overall company exposure in the event we default on the debt to the amount we have invested in the asset or assets financed 
we seek to finance our assets with match funded or substantially match funded debt  meaning that we seek to obtain debt whose maturity matches as closely as possible the maturity of the asset financed 
through december   our long term fixed rate asset financings have been in the form of traditional third party non recourse first mortgage financings on most of our owned real properties and one non recourse secured term loan completed in december 
as of december   we have financed on a long term basis an aggregate of approximately billion of portfolio assets with third party first mortgage debt of million and a secured term loan of million 
long term mortgage financings we have financed most of our owned properties through traditional first mortgage financings provided primarily through the commercial mortgage backed securitization market 
we also have utilized the term financings described below including the cdo transaction we sold during september  to add incremental leverage on many of our owned properties 
during the quarter ended december   we assumed in place mortgage financing on the property we acquired in new orleans  louisiana 
the principal economic terms of the three fully amortizing notes we assumed are summarized in the following table assumed face amount of mortgage note property in thousands coupon maturity date lowe s companies  inc  new orleans  la  august lowe s companies  inc  new orleans  la  august lowe s companies  inc  new orleans  la august as of december   we had million of non recourse first mortgage debt at a weighted average coupon of and a weighted average effective financing rate of 
our mortgage financings are all fixed rate financings 
the notes typically mature over a long term period of approximately ten years  and debt service is payable monthly 
the notes are non recourse to us subject to limited recourse exceptions and are secured by a mortgage on the property and an assignment of the underlying lease and rents on the property 
the notes are frequently interest only for all or a portion of the note term  and in most cases require a balloon payment at maturity 
as described above  we cannot provide any assurance we will be able to refinance or repay these obligations at maturity and our ability to do so on favorable terms will be highly dependent upon prevailing market conditions 
see business environment above and item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
term financings we have financed most of our loan and securities investments as well as a select number of our owned properties through the term financings described below 
as noted above  we have also utilized term financings to add incremental leverage on our owned properties financed with mortgage debt 
secured term loan 
in december  we completed a secured term loan with a european bank 
we transferred a pool of assets into a wholly owned special purpose entity  called caplease stl llc  and issued debt to the lender secured by the assets in the pool 
we retained all of the equity in the special purpose entity  or spe  and  therefore  are entitled to all residual cash after the payment of scheduled principal and interest on the debt 
the lender s debt is structured to be senior to our equity 
for example  all principal payments on the assets transferred to the spe will be paid to the lender until the secured term loan in repaid in full 
we are in a first loss position in the event of a payment default or loss on any of the spe assets 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding under the secured term loan  secured by assets with a carry value of million 
the interest coupon on the loan is fixed at annually until the loan matures in january our effective financing rate on the loan is annually inclusive of hedge and closing costs 
the loan is non recourse to us  subject to limited non recourse exceptions 
cdo financing 
during september  we completed the sale of our march cdo 
for legal and accounting purposes  the sale resulted in the transfer by us of the various assets in the cdo trust along with the transfer of the obligation to pay debt service on the various cdo note classes 
the cdo sale generated cash proceeds net of debt repaid and excluding accrued interest of approximately million  and a net gain of million  before the charge off of primarily deferred issuance costs and deferred realized gains on cash flow hedges totaling million 
credit agreement 
we have entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na as successor to wachovia bank  na and financed certain of our portfolio assets pursuant to the credit agreement 
we also may utilize the undrawn amount of the lender s revolving credit commitment to finance assets approved by the lender in its sole discretion at an advance rate of of the asset s value as determined by the lender 
the credit agreement with wells fargo bank includes the following terms size maximum revolving credit commitment of million  maturity maturity date of july   and interest rate floating rate libor based facility with interest rate on our borrowings set at one month libor plus basis points 
as of december   our outstanding borrowings under the agreement were million and our effective financing rate was 
the agreement is a floating rate libor based facility 
our borrowings under the agreement are secured by a combination of first mortgage loan investments  intercompany mortgage loans on our owned property investments  commercial mortgage backed securities and a first lien on our ownership interest in the real property located in johnston  rhode island 
our obligations under the credit agreement are also fully recourse to all of our other assets and  pursuant to the margin call provisions in the agreement  we may be obligated to prepay a portion of the debt if wells fargo bank determines the value of our collateral has declined  including as a result of an underlying tenant credit rating downgrade or other adverse tenant credit event 
in the event wells fargo bank determines in its sole discretion that the value of our collateral has declined  wells fargo bank may require us to prepay a portion of our borrowings  provided that wells fargo bank may not reduce the value of any of our collateral other than cmbs securities due to general credit spread or interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   we had million borrowed against collateral classified as cmbs securities by wells fargo bank 
we are required to comply with the following financial covenants under the credit agreement minimum liquidity basically cash and cash equivalents of at least million  minimum consolidated tangible net worth basically stockholders equity before accumulated depreciation and amortization of at least million plus of the aggregate net proceeds from equity offerings or capital contributions after july   maximum corporate leverage basically total liabilities divided by total assets before accumulated depreciation and amortization of  and minimum interest coverage basically ebitda  or net income before income taxes  interest expense  and depreciation and amortization  divided by interest expense of 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above financial covenants  and we do not currently anticipate any difficulty in maintaining compliance with these covenants in future periods 
as of december   our million of borrowings under our wells fargo bank credit agreement were secured by loan investments with an aggregate carry value of million  intercompany mortgage loans with an aggregate carry value of million  cmbs investments with a carry value of million and a single owned property with a carry value of million 
we may pursue a variety of strategies for the assets financed on the credit agreement  which may include obtaining long term fixed rate financing when market conditions permit  pursuing selected asset sales  and retiring the debt on selected assets and holding the assets unlevered 
we expect credit market conditions to impact our ability to achieve these objectives and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance as to the timing or our ability to do so

we recognize rental income on our owned properties on a straight line basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   this has resulted in us accruing million of rental income in excess of actual rents due under the various leases 
during the year ended december   rents on a straight line basis exceeded actual rents due under the leases by million 
we expect the impact of straight lining of rents to fluctuate over time as contractual rents step up and actual rents due increase under the various leases and we purchase additional properties 
certain of our owned properties are also subject to rents which pay semi annually  rather than monthly  and this also impacts the quarter to quarter changes due to straight lining of rents

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices  rate indices or other market factors 
we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  tenant credit ratings and equity prices 
we may attempt to mitigate certain of these risks by entering into hedge and other risk management transactions during the short term and fixed rate financings for the long term 
we seek to obtain long term fixed rate financing as soon as practicable after we make an asset investment 
there can be no assurance  however  that such mitigation strategies will be completely or even partially successful 
the level of our exposure to market risk is subject to factors beyond our control  including political risk including terrorism  monetary and tax policy  general economic conditions and a variety of other associated risks 
interest rate exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk in various aspects of our business 
the most significant ways we can be impacted by interest rates are as follows increases in the level of interest rates may impact our ability to add new assets  as spreads on assets we are targeting may compress unless there is a corresponding increase in asset returns 
declines in interest rates could result in greater demand for higher yielding assets and therefore increased competition for our asset class 
also  to the extent we finance assets in our portfolio on our floating rate borrowing facilities  our net income from these fixed rate assets will decrease as interest rates rise particularly libor rates and our borrowing cost increases 
our wells fargo bank credit agreement and loan agreement with bank of oklahoma no borrowings outstanding are currently our only floating rate borrowing facilities 
low market interest rates kept our borrowing cost on the wells fargo bank credit agreement low during and although we cannot predict the level of market interest rates in the future 
in addition  as interest rates rise  our anticipated cost to finance assets on a long term fixed rate basis may rise  causing our expected spread on assets to be reduced 
we may attempt to mitigate these risks by entering into risk management transactions that react in a manner that offsets our increased interest costs and by locking our long term financing cost as soon as practicable after we commit to an asset 
as a result of market conditions  we are not currently carrying an open interest rate hedge to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations for assets for which we may obtain long term financing for in the future 
our decision to do so leaves us exposed to increases in long term interest rates for those assets and  therefore  may make it more difficult or more costly to obtain long term financing 
as noted above  there can be no assurance that our mitigation strategies will be successful 
furthermore  shifts in the us treasury yield curve  which represents the market s expectations of future interest rates  would also affect the yield required on our loans and real estate securities 
changes in the required yield would result in a higher or lower value for these assets 
if the required market yields increase as a result of these interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would decline relative to us treasuries 
conversely  if the required market yields decrease as a result of interest rate changes  the value of our loans and real estate securities would increase relative to us treasuries 
these changes in the market value may affect the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the losses to be other than temporary  our statement of operations through impairment losses on our loans or securities 
these value changes may also affect our ability to borrow and access capital 
credit spread curve exposure we are subject to credit spread risk in various aspects of our business 
credit spreads represent the portion of the required yield on an income investment attributable to credit quality 
credit spreads fluctuate over time as investor appetite for credit risk changes 
changes in credit spreads can have many of the same impacts on us as a change in interest rates  or principally increases in credit spreads can result in spread compression on investments we target and  thus  a slowing of our new investment pace  increases in credit spreads can increase our anticipated cost to finance assets not yet financed with long term fixed rate debt  causing our expected spread on these assets to be reduced  and increases in credit spreads can lower the value of our loans and securities as required yields on these assets increase 
tenant credit rating exposure substantially all of our portfolio assets are subject to risks due to credit rating changes of the underlying tenant or tenants 
deterioration in the underlying tenant s credit rating can result in a lower value for the related asset  which could result in a reduction in the equity on our balance sheet or  if the value is less than our cost basis and we determine the loss to be other than temporary  an impairment loss on our statement of operations 
in addition  declines in the credit rating of a particular tenant prior to our obtaining long term fixed rate financing could result in a margin call by the related lender  and precipitous declines may significantly impede or eliminate our ability to finance the asset 
we manage these risks by maintaining diversity among our credits and assessing our aggregate exposure to ratings classes  in particular lower rated classes 
we also seek to lock or procure long term financing on our assets as promptly as practicable after we commit to invest 
equity price risk exposure we may seek to raise capital by sale of our common stock 
our ability to do so is dependent upon the market price of our common stock and general market conditions 
any common stock sales we make may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
fair value for certain of our financial instruments  fair values are not readily available since there are no active trading markets as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  we derive or estimate fair values using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated cash flows may be subjective and imprecise 
changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material affect on these estimated fair values 
the fair values indicated below are indicative of the interest rate and credit spread environment as of december   and december   as the case may be  and may not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate or credit spread fluctuations  or changes in the ratings of the underlying tenants

we have estimated the fair value of this portfolio of loans with a discounted cash flow analysis  utilizing scheduled cash flows and discount rates estimated by management to approximate those that a willing buyer and seller might use 
the maturity dates for the loans range from through commercial mortgage backed securities represent subordinate interests in securitizations  as well as pass through certificates representing our pro rata investments in a pool of mortgage loans collectively  cmbs 
the notional values for the cmbs are shown at their respective face amounts 
the fair values of cmbs reflect management s best estimate and require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
management evaluates a variety of inputs and then estimates fair value based on those inputs 
the primary inputs evaluated by management are broker quotations  collateral values  subordination levels  and liquidity of the security 
for the cmbs  we expect to receive monthly interest coupon payments  and contractual principal payments as scheduled 
our credit agreement bears interest at floating rates  and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks  the effective rates approximate market value 
accordingly  the carrying amounts outstanding are believed to approximate fair value 
we estimate the fair value of mortgage notes on real estate investments  collateralized debt obligations and the secured term loan using a discounted cash flow analysis  based on our estimates of market interest rates 
for mortgages where we have an early payment right  we also consider the prepayment amount to evaluate the fair value 
the carry value and effective financing rate on the convertible senior notes reflect the impact of the accounting guidance applicable to the notes as of january  see note in our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we estimate the fair value of our convertible senior notes using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates  and indications of market yields  where available 
the maturity date of our convertible senior notes reflects our expected maturity date in october when the note investors have the right to require us to repurchase their notes for cash and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate 
we estimate the fair value of our other long term debt using a discounted cash flow analysis  based upon management s estimates of market interest rates 
the maturity date of our other long term debt reflects our expected maturity date in january and is used to compute the related fair value and weighted average effective interest rate
