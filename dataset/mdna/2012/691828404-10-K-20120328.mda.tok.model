further  we operate in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
overview we are a clinical stage  biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer 
our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents  or vdas  that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions 
we intend to primarily target the development of our product candidates for the treatment of rare cancers that will be eligible for orphan drug status from the food and drug administration  or fda 
our lead candidate  zybrestat  has been awarded orphan drug status by the fda and the european commission in the european union for the treatment of advanced anaplastic thyroid cancer  or atc  and for the treatment of medullary  stage iv papillary and stage iv follicular thyroid cancers 
the fda has also granted fast track status to zybrestat for the treatment of regionally advanced and or metastatic atc  as well as in ovarian cancer 
the orphan drug act was passed in january to stimulate the research  development  and approval of products that treat rare diseases 
an orphan drug is defined as a product that treats a rare disease affecting fewer than  patients in the united states 
drugs are granted orphan status for a specific indication 

table of contents to date  more than subjects have been treated with zybrestat in human clinical trials  and the drug candidate has generally been observed to be well tolerated 
zybrestat for oncology zybrestat is a reversible tubulin binding agent that works by disrupting the network of blood vessels  or vasculature  within solid tumors  also referred to as vascular disruption 
vascular disruption leads to tumor hypoxia  which refers to the process of starving the tumor of vitally necessary oxygen supply and subsequent tumor cell death 
more specifically  zybrestat selectively targets the existing abnormal and largely immature vasculature found specifically in most solid tumors and causes endothelial cells that make up the walls of the blood vessels in that vasculature to lose their normally flat shape and to become round  thus blocking the flow of blood to the tumor 
the downstream tumor environment is then deprived of oxygen and nutrients  and the resulting restriction in blood supply kills the cells in the central portion of the tumor 
based on zybrestat s positive activity observed in animal models  we have conducted multiple clinical trials of zybrestat in a variety of tumor types 
our top priority is to pursue the clinical development of zybrestat in atc 
atc is a very aggressive  rare but lethal cancer of the thyroid gland 
because of the rapid progression of the disease and the absence of effective therapies  median survival from the time of diagnosis is approximately months 
we have completed a phase clinical trial of zybrestat in patients with atc  and we are currently planning a pivotal phase clinical trial of zybrestat in atc  which we refer to as the fact trial 
we believe that the fact trial represents a critical opportunity to demonstrate the value of our key asset  zybrestat  and has the potential to create significant value for our company and our shareholders 
as such  our primary corporate strategy for is to secure sufficient funding to conduct the trial 
we also intend to pursue a special protocol assessment spa for this program with the fda  with the goal of laying the foundation for initiation of this global registration study 
we believe completion of the fact study  assuming continued positive clinical results  will be sufficient to obtain fda approval and approval in europe for the treatment of patients with advanced atc 
possible areas for future development atc and ovarian cancer  and potentially other orphan indications  represent areas for further development and significant unmet medical needs  and thus significant potential commercial market opportunities 
further development of our ongoing clinical trials will depend on continuing analysis and results of ongoing clinical studies  as well as available financial resources and or potential partnering activities 
oxi  a unique  second generation vda for oncology indications we are currently pursuing development of oxi  a second generation  dual mechanism vda  as a treatment for certain solid tumor types and for the treatment of myeloid leukemias  which also represent orphan indications 
we believe that oxi is differentiated from other vdas by its dual action activity in addition to having potent vascular disrupting effects  oxi is unique in that certain enzymes in the human body can help convert it to a form of chemical that has direct tumor cell killing effects 
we believe this unique property may result in enhanced anti tumor activity in certain tumor types as compared with other vda drug candidates 
based on data from preclinical studies  we believe that oxi may have enhanced activity in tumor types with relatively high levels of the enzymes that facilitate the conversion of oxi to the form of chemical that kills tumor cells 
these tumor types include hepatocellular carcinoma  melanoma  and leukemias of the myeloid lineage 
in preclinical studies  oxi has shown potent anti tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia models  both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities 
based on the results of preclinical studies published in the journal blood in september that show oxi has potent activity against acute myelogenous leukemia aml in animal models  we entered into a clinical trial agreement pursuant to which investigators at the university of florida initiated an investigator sponsored phase study of oxi in patients with aml or myelodysplastic syndrome mds in may this open label  dose escalating study for the treatment of up to patients is being conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory aml and mds and will evaluate the safety profile  maximum tolerated dose and biologic activity of oxi in these patients 
we expect that initial indications of biologic activity from this study may be available in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the general direction of future development of oxi for hematologic indications will depend on the outcome of the analysis of the study in aml  as well as available financial resources and potential partnering activities 
zybrestat for ophthalmology in addition to developing zybrestat as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications  we have previously undertaken an ophthalmology research and development program with zybrestat with the ultimate goal of developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that result in loss of vision 
due to financial constraints  we are not actively pursuing development in this area at this time 
we believe that a safe  effective and convenient topically administered anti vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti vascular  ophthalmological therapeutics  many of which must be injected directly into patients eyes  in some cases on a chronic monthly basis 
we have also evaluated the requirements for additional preclinical toxicology and efficacy studies with zybrestat for topical ophthalmological formulations to better position the program for partnering 
further development of this program will depend on the outcome of our evaluation of these requirements and available financial resources 
financial resources we have experienced net losses every year since our inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no recurring material amount of licensing or other income 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents 
on july   we entered into an at the market atm equity offering sales agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through mlv acting as our sales agent and underwriter 
sales of our common stock through mlv are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
mlv uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits we may impose 
we pay mlv a commission rate of up to of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through mlv as agent under the sales agreement 
during our fiscal year  we sold approximately  shares of our common stock using this arrangement for net proceeds of approximately  currently  we are not able to sell additional shares under this atm due to sec limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a form s registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us 
we expect to be able to resume such sales in the second half of  should we meet the issuance criteria of the sec and nasdaq 
on september   we announced a restructuring plan  which included employee terminations  designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization 
we announced the following key aspects of the restructuring and their effects on our operations including current and planned clinical trials at this time  a company sponsored phase registrational study of zybrestat in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer atc funded entirely by internal financial resources is not feasible 
we intend to continue to explore options for conducting such a study  including potential collaborations with national and international head and neck cancer cooperative groups 
future development decisions concerning zybrestat in patients with atc will be made following a review of all options by our management and our board of directors 

table of contents we have concluded the final analysis of our completed phase study of zybrestat in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with non small cell lung cancer falcon study 
any future development decisions concerning the study of zybrestat in patients with nsclc will depend on our financial resources 
we continue to support the ongoing randomized phase trial of zybrestat in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer  which is an nci sponsored study being conducted by the gynecologic oncology group gog  an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer 
we continue to support of the ongoing investigator sponsored phase trial of oxi in patients with aml or myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds  being conducted at the university of florida and with support by the leukemia lymphoma society s therapy acceleration program 
we are evaluating additional early stage development opportunities for our two product candidates  zybrestat and oxi  subject to available resources 
we reduced our workforce by full time equivalent employees or approximately 
as of march   we had a total of eight full time employees and approximately three full time equivalent employees working on a part time basis 
we are seeking to reduce the amount of space we currently rent  primarily by closing our office in waltham  massachusetts no later than the lease expiration in may and by conducting our operations only out of our south san francisco office as soon as practicable 
we offered severance benefits to the terminated employees  and have recorded a total charge of approximately  primarily associated with personnel related termination costs 
in order to provide for an orderly transition  we implemented the reduction in work force in a phased manner 
substantially all of the charge represents cash expenditures 
upon completion of the restructuring activities outlined above  we expect to reduce expenses from fiscal levels by an annual amount of approximately  our ability to achieve this anticipated cost reduction is contingent upon only continuing to conduct the projects for which we are currently committed 
based on this planned level of cash utilization  we will be unable to significantly advance our more developed candidates  including zybrestat in atc 
in november  we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale  from time to time  of up to  of our common stock with lincoln park capital fund  llc lpc  a chicago based institutional investor 
the proceeds from any sales under this purchase agreement will be used to further develop our late and early stage clinical pipeline and to fund our ongoing operations 
during the month term of the purchase agreement  we control the timing and amount of any sales to lpc  if and when we decide  in accordance with the purchase agreement 
lpc has no right to require us to sell any shares to lpc  but lpc is obligated to make purchases as we direct  subject to certain conditions  which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to lpc and limitations related to the market value of our common stock 
there is no guarantee that funding from lpc will be available when needed  or at all  or that the company will be able to maintain effectiveness of the aforementioned registration statement 
there are no upper limits to the price lpc may pay to purchase our common stock and the purchase price of the shares related to any future sales will be based on the prevailing market prices of our shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to lpc without any fixed discount 
the agreement may be terminated by us at any time  at our sole discretion  without any cost or penalty 
no amounts were received under this facility during in december  we established a partnership agreement with azanta danmark a s  or azanta  to provide access to zybrestat for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with atc on a compassionate use basis 
our newly formed named patient program to be managed by azanta  provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in europe and canada to prescribe zybrestat to individual atc patients while it is still in development 
under the terms of the agreement  we will provide zybrestat to azanta 
azanta will serve as exclusive distributor for zybrestat in the specified territory for this purpose and will provide zybrestat to physicians solely to treat atc on a compassionate use basis in 
table of contents the territory covered by the agreement until such time as zybrestat may obtain marketing approval in that territory 
the territory includes the european union  including the nordic countries and switzerland  and canada  and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country by country basis 
we and azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to zybrestat for the treatment of atc within the territory 
there will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for zybrestat to azanta under the terms of the agreement 
we do not expect to receive significant income from azanta under this arrangement 
no revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and taking into consideration the expected reductions in cash utilization resulting from our september reduction in force  we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the first quarter of however  this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any significant projects to further the development of our most advanced product candidates  primarily zybrestat in atc 
any significant further development of zybrestat or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements 
we will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates 
such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to access additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
any additional equity financing  which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms  most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  on terms that are not favorable to us 
our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and  if not achieved on a timely basis  will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base  with development  scientific  finance and administrative functions  which include  among other things  product development  regulatory oversight and clinical testing 
our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently 
accordingly  we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project by project basis 
we conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities 
regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third party  specialty organizations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents concentration of credit risk we have no significant off balance sheet concentrations of credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents 
we hold our cash and cash equivalents at one financial institution 
cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
we have  that is used to secure financing through a company credit card 
this amount is separated from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet 
accrued research and development we charge all research and development expenses  both internal and external costs  to operations as incurred 
our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations  product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates 
we recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts 
costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably 
costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract 
in determining costs incurred on some of these programs  we take into consideration a number of factors  including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers 
upon termination of such contracts  we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date 
as a result  accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times 
any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are properly classified as prepaid until such goods or services are rendered 
license agreements on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement approximately years 
management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long lived assets if triggering events occur 
we review for such triggering events  including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing operating losses  periodically 
in addition  the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement 
we expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable 
share based compensation we record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  which is issuable upon exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock  
table of contents the expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term 
stock option exercise price and grant date price of our common stock the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
expected term the expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time 
expected volatility the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the option granted 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
expected dividends because we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any of our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant 
of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
we are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
accordingly  we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting  and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate 
we segregate participants into two distinct groups  directors and officers and employees  and apply the estimated forfeiture rates using the straight line uniform method to record expense 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate adjusted as necessary 
symphony transaction in october  we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony  a private equity firm  under which symphony agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybrestat for oncology  zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi in connection with the collaboration  we granted symphony vida  inc  a newly created drug development company  exclusive licenses to zybrestat for use in ophthalmologic indications and oxi under the collaboration  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  symphony vida  symphony vida holdings llc holdings and related entities  including a purchase option agreement  a research and development agreement  a technology license agreement and an additional funding agreement 
in addition  we entered into a series of related agreements with holdings  including a stock and warrant purchase agreement and a registration rights agreement 
pursuant to these agreements  holdings formed and capitalized symphony vida in order a to hold certain intellectual property related to the programs which were exclusively licensed to symphony vida under the technology license agreement and b to fund commitments of up to  the funding was intended to support preclinical and clinical development by us  on behalf of symphony vida  of the programs 
we issued to holdings  pursuant to the stock and warrant purchase agreement  an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants at a price of per share  which was the closing price of our common stock on september   the day before we entered into the symphony transaction 
in addition  pursuant to the purchase option agreement  we issued to holdings an aggregate of  shares of our common stock with a fair value of  as consideration for the purchase option 
on july   we  holdings and symphony vida entered into a series of related agreements pursuant to which we exercised the purchase option under terms set forth in an amended and restated purchase option agreement the amended purchase option agreement  and we and holdings also entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement 

table of contents we closed on the amended purchase option on july  and issued  shares of our common stock to holdings at the closing in exchange for all of the equity of symphony vida 
in addition  upon the closing of the purchase option  we re acquired all of the rights to the programs  and the approximately  in cash held by symphony vida at the time of the closing became available for use for general corporate purposes 
consolidation of variable interest entity vie a variable interest entity vie is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
a vie should be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the vie s outcomes 
the application of accounting policy to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment 
we consolidated the financial position and results of operations of symphony vida  inc vida from october  when it entered into a strategic collaboration with symphony vida holdings  llc symphony  until july  when we acquired of vida pursuant to the amended purchase option agreement 
we believe vida was by design a vie because we had a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limited symphony vida holding s returns  as the investor in vida 
further  due to the direct investment from holdings in our common stock  as a related party vida was a vie of which we were the primary beneficiary 
after we exercised the purchase option  vida became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and ceased being a vie 
accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests on january   we adopted retrospectively for all periods presented the new presentation requirements for noncontrolling interests required by asc  consolidations 
under asc  earnings or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests are reported as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense 
accordingly  we reported the consolidated earnings of vida in its consolidated statement of operations from october  when we entered into a strategic collaboration with symphony  until july   when we acquired of the equity of vida pursuant to the amended purchase option agreement 
once becoming our wholly owned subsidiary  the operating results of vida continued to be included in our consolidated statement of operations but were no longer subject to the presentation requirements applicable to noncontrolling interests 
losses incurred by vida  and attributable to symphony  were charged to noncontrolling interest 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in the company s common stock we evaluate all derivative financial instruments issued in connection with our equity offerings when determining the proper accounting treatment for such instruments in the company s financial statements 
the company considers a number of generally accepted accounting principles to determine such treatment 
the company performs a number of steps to evaluate the features of the instrument against the guidance provided in the accounting pronouncements in order to determine the appropriate accounting treatment 
the company s policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards 
in the majority of circumstances  we utilize the black scholes method to determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments 
in some cases  where appropriate  we utilize the binomial method to determine the fair value of such derivative financial instruments 
key valuation factors in determining the fair value include the current stock price as of the date of measurement  the exercise price  the remaining contractual life  expected volatility for the instrument and the risk free interest rate 
changes in fair value are recorded as a gain or loss in our statement of operations with the corresponding amount recorded as an adjustment to the liability on our balance sheet 
the expected volatility factor  in particular  is subject to significant variability from measurement period to measurement period and can result in large gains or losses from period to period 

table of contents revenue recognition in december  we established a partnership agreement with azanta danmark a s  or azanta  to provide access to zybrestat for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with atc on a compassionate use basis 
our newly formed named patient program to be managed by azanta  provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in europe and canada to prescribe zybrestat to individual atc patients while it is still in development 
our agreement with azanta provides that upon the receipt of zybrestat by azanta for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients  azanta has days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by us 
if azanta does not notify us of any defective product within the day period it will be deemed to have accepted the product 
revenue is recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the day inspection period 
also  azanta will pay to us  on a quarterly basis  an amount equal to of azanta s gross margin  as defined in the agreement  on its sales in the preceding quarter 
this revenue will be recognized upon notification from azanta of the gross margin earned 
in addition  we licensed to a third party our formerly owned nicoplex and thiol test technology 
revenue in connection with this license arrangement is earned based on sales of products or services utilizing this technology 
revenue is recognized under this agreement when payments are received due to the uncertainty of the timing of sales of products or services 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues we did not recognize any license revenue in the years ended december  and future revenues  if any  from license agreements are expected to be minimal 
in addition  we did not recognize any product revenue in the fiscal year ended december  in connection with our distribution agreement with azanta as no product had been accepted by azanta as of december  our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to  and generate revenues from products currently under development by us 
we expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up front payments

these two major studies have been progressing to conclusion over the last to months 
in addition  we experienced reductions in expenses on our oxi and zybrestat for ophthalmology programs for the comparable period  primarily related to our decision in february to scale back efforts on some of our projects in these areas 
the reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same twelve month period of is due to reductions in our clinical project expenses noted above 
in february and again in september  we implemented a company wide restructuring plan due to our decision to scale back activities in some of our ongoing clinical projects 
the reduction in other expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same twelve month period of is primarily due to a reduction in both our research and development facility related costs as well as program wide support costs for the comparable periods

table of contents the reduction in consulting and professional services expenses for the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same twelve month period of is primarily due to one time costs incurred in in connection with both our attempt to acquire vaxgen inc and to a pipe financing transaction that did not recur in the period 
in addition  we experienced lower board member compensation expense attributable to lower stock valuations during the first half of the period as a portion of fees to board members are paid in the form of non cash stock awards 
also  we recognized lower legal  accounting and service provider expenses due to fewer significant transactions during the period 
restructuring plan on september   we announced a restructuring plan  which included employee terminations  designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization 
we announced the following key aspects of the restructuring and their effects on our operations including current and planned clinical trials at this time  a company sponsored phase registrational study of zybrestat in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer atc funded entirely by internal financial resources is not feasible

we have concluded the final analysis of our completed phase study of zybrestat in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with non small cell lung cancer falcon study 
any future development decisions concerning the study of zybrestat in patients with nsclc will depend on our financial resources 
we continue to support the ongoing randomized phase trial of zybrestat in combination with bevacizumab in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer  which is an nci sponsored study being conducted by the gynecologic oncology group gog  an organization dedicated to clinical research in the field of gynecologic cancer 
we continue to support of the ongoing investigator sponsored phase trial of oxi in patients with aml or myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds  being conducted at the university of florida and with support by the leukemia lymphoma society s therapy acceleration program 
we are evaluating additional early stage development opportunities for our two product candidates  zybrestat and oxi  subject to available resources at the time 
we reduced our workforce by full time equivalent employees or approximately 
as of march   we had a total of eight full time employees and approximately three full time equivalent employees working on a part time basis 
we are seeking to reduce the amount of space we currently rent  primarily by closing our office in waltham  massachusetts no later than the lease expiration in may and by conducting our operations only out of our south san francisco office as soon as practicable

in  the loss primarily relates to the triggering of the full ratchet provisions of the pipe warrants  where the exercise price of each warrant was decreased  causing a greater warrant liability 
in  the gain primarily relates to the decline in the underlying fair value of the common stock 
the decrease in investment income of  for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of a reduction in our average month end cash balance available for investment during the respective periods 
the other income expense amounts are derived from our gain and loss on foreign currency exchange and reflect both a change in number of foreign clinical trials and the fluctuation in exchange rates 
also included in the fiscal amount is our receipt of  in connection with qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section d of the internal revenue code in november liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through our strategic development arrangement with symphony  which concluded in we have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception  except in fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to continue to incur increased expenses  resulting in losses  over at least the next several years due to  among other factors  our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities

the net change in operating assets and liabilities is primarily attributable to a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other payables of  offset in part by a decrease in restricted cash of  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the net proceeds of the sale of common stock under our at the market equity financing facility discussed below 
on january   we entered into separate warrant exchange agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in march  pursuant to which  at the initial closing  the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding series a and series c warrants having ratchet price based anti dilution protections for a an aggregate of  shares of common stock and b series e warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the series e warrants were not exercisable for six months  had an exercise price of per share reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on january   prior to the entry into the warrant exchange agreements  and do not contain any price based anti dilution protections 
in addition  we agreed to seek shareholder approval to issue up to  additional shares of common stock to the warrant holders in a subsequent closing 
such shareholder approval was obtained on march   and the series e warrants issued at the initial closing were exchanged for the additional  shares of common stock 
on july   we entered into an at the market atm equity offering sales agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc  mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through mlv acting as our sales agent and underwriter 
sales of our common stock through mlv  are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us

we pay mlv a commission rate of up to of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through mlv as agent under the sales agreement 
during our fiscal year  we sold approximately  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately  currently  we are not able to sell additional shares under this atm due to sec limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a form s registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as us 
we expect to be able to resume such sales in the second half of  should we meet the issuance criteria of the sec and nasdaq 
on september   we announced a restructuring plan  which included employee terminations  designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization 
we offered severance benefits to the terminated employees  and have recorded a total charge of approximately  primarily associated with personnel related termination costs 
in order to provide for an orderly transition  we implemented the reduction in work force in a phased manner 
substantially all of the charge represents cash expenditures 
upon completion of the restructuring activities outlined above  we expect to reduce expenses from fiscal levels by an annual amount of approximately  our ability to achieve this anticipated cost reduction is contingent upon only continuing to conduct the projects for which we are currently committed 
based on this planned level of cash utilization  we will be unable to advance our more developed candidates  including zybrestat in atc 
in november  we entered into a purchase agreement for the sale  from time to time  of up to  of our common stock with lincoln park capital fund  llc lpc  a chicago based institutional investor 
the proceeds from any sales under this purchase agreement will be used to further develop our late and early stage clinical pipeline and to fund our ongoing operations 
during the month term of the purchase agreement  we control the timing and amount of any sales to lpc  if and when we decide  in accordance with the purchase agreement 
lpc has no right to require us to sell any shares to lpc  but lpc is obligated to make purchases as we direct  subject to certain conditions  which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to lpc and limitations related to the market value of our common stock

the agreement may be terminated by us at any time  at our sole discretion  without any cost or penalty 
no amounts were received under this facility during in december  we established a partnership agreement with azanta danmark a s  or azanta  to provide access to zybrestat for the treatment of patients in a specified territory with atc on a compassionate use basis 
our newly formed named patient program to be managed by azanta provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the territory to prescribe zybrestat to individual atc patients while it is still in development 
under the terms of the agreement  we will provide zybrestat to azanta 
azanta will serve as exclusive distributor for zybrestat in the specified territory for this purpose and will provide zybrestat to physicians solely to treat atc on a compassionate use basis in the territory covered by the agreement until such time as zybrestat may obtain marketing approval in that territory 
the territory includes the european union  including the nordic countries and switzerland  and canada  and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country by country basis 
oxigene and azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to zybrestat for the treatment of atc within the territory 
there will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for zybrestat to azanta under the terms of the agreement 
we do not expect to receive significant income from azanta under this arrangement 
no revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and taking into consideration the expected reductions in cash utilization resulting from our september reduction in force  we expect our existing cash and cash equivalents to support our operations through the first quarter of however  this level of cash utilization does not provide for the initiation of any significant projects to further the development of our most advanced product candidates  primarily zybrestat in atc 
any significant further development of zybrestat or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements we will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates 
our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development  including zybrestat and oxi  the costs of complying with fda and other regulatory agency requirements  including addressing the findings set forth by the fda in its correspondence to us in march  which will be significant as described in the risk factors above regarding the conduct of clinical trials and regulatory requirements  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs  the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting and  if necessary  enforcing our patent claims  or defending against possible claims of infringement by third party patent or other technology rights  the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements  if any  undertaken by us  and  if and when approved  the demand for our products  which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known  understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval  including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we will not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we will be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs or cease operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize 
our failure to raise capital when needed will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years clinical development and related commitment operating leases total contractual cash obligations payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract 
the amounts in the table above assume the successful completion  by the third party contractor  of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments  commodity based instruments or other long term debt obligations 
we have accounted for certain outstanding warrants issued in connection with our prior equity offerings as liabilities as of december  we have adopted an investment policy  the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in us dollar accounts 
although we may from time to time conduct trials and studies outside of the united states  we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are typically in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies
