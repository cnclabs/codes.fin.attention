table of contents part i item business business and products overview we are a global apparel company  which designs  sources  markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of our company owned lifestyle brands as well as certain licensed and private label apparel products 
our portfolio of brands includes tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  as well as owned and licensed brands for tailored clothing and golf apparel 
we distribute our company owned lifestyle branded products through our direct to consumer channel  consisting of owned retail stores and e commerce sites  and our wholesale distribution channel  which includes better department stores and specialty stores 
additionally  we operate tommy bahama restaurants  generally adjacent to a tommy bahama retail store 
during fiscal  of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own  and approximately of our net sales were sales of our products through our direct to consumer channels of distribution  which includes our owned retail stores  e commerce websites and restaurants 
in fiscal  approximately of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the united states  with the remainder primarily being sales of our ben sherman products in the united kingdom and europe 
our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that are fashion right and evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers 
we strive to exploit the potential of our existing brands and products domestically and internationally and  as suitable opportunities arise  to acquire additional lifestyle brands that we believe fit within our business model 
we consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude  such as the tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman brands 
we believe that lifestyle branded products that create an emotional connection with our target customers  can command greater customer loyalty and higher price points at retail  resulting in higher earnings 
we also believe a successful lifestyle brand opens up greater opportunities for direct to consumer operations as well as licensing opportunities in product categories beyond our core business 
our direct to consumer operations provide us with the opportunity to interact directly with our customers and to present to them the full line of our current season products 
we believe that presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the lifestyle on which the brands are based enhances the image of our brands 
we believe that our company owned retail stores provide high visibility for our brands and products  and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers  while also providing a platform for long term sustainable growth for the brands without jeopardizing the image of the brands 
additionally  our e commerce websites for our lifestyle brands provide the opportunity to reach a larger population of consumers and at the same time allow our brands to provide a broader range of our products 
for tommy bahama and ben sherman  we also operate outlet stores that play an important role in overall inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out of season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties 
as of january   we operated tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman retail locations  including outlet locations for tommy bahama and ben sherman 
we anticipate further investments in tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman to increase the retail store footprint of each of the brands and to further enhance each brand s e commerce operations 
in addition to our direct to consumer operations  we distribute our products through several wholesale distribution channels  including better department stores  specialty stores  national chains  specialty catalogs  mass merchants and internet retailers 
we believe it is imperative that we maintain the integrity of our lifestyle brands by ensuring that the branded products are sold to wholesale 
table of contents customers who will enhance the image of our brands 
because our tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products in our owned full price retail locations are typically sold at full price with limited sales or promotions  we target wholesale customers that typically follow this same approach in their stores 
our ten largest customers represented approximately of our consolidated net sales for fiscal  with no individual customer representing more than of our consolidated net sales 
in addition to our owned lifestyle brands  currently within our lanier clothes operating group we hold licenses to produce and sell certain categories of apparel products under certain brands  sell certain private label products and sell products bearing brands that we own 
during fiscal  sales of products being licensed brands accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales  while sales of private label products represented approximately of our consolidated net sales 
we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous us based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominate the apparel industry and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is related to our ability to foresee changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference  and to present appealing products for consumers 
in some instances  a retailer that is our customer may compete directly with us by offering certain of their own competing products  some of which may be sourced directly by our customer 
additionally  the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the conditions have on other industries 
the global economic conditions and resulting economic uncertainty that began in fiscal continue to impact each of our operating groups  and the apparel industry as a whole 
although declines in consumer spending have moderated and our product sales have generally increased recently  unemployment levels remain high  consumer retail traffic generally remains depressed  the retail environment remains highly promotional and there remains a significant amount of economic uncertainty 
we believe that sales of our products may continue to be negatively impacted as long as there is an ongoing level of economic uncertainty 
important factors relating to certain risks  many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict  which could impact our business include  but are not limited to  competition  economic factors and others as described in part i  item a 
risk factors of this report 
fiscal investments and opportunities we believe that our operating groups have significant opportunities for long term growth 
we believe that each of our lifestyle brands has opportunities for growth in their direct to consumer businesses through expansion of our retail store footprint as well as increases in same store sales and continued growth in our e commerce businesses 
we also believe that our lifestyle brands provide an opportunity for moderate sales increases in our wholesale businesses primarily from our current customers adding to their existing door count and the selective addition of new wholesale customers 
we believe that in order to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth  we must continue to invest in our lifestyle brands to further their expansion by opening additional retail stores and taking other measures 
we expect that these investments will negatively impact our short term operating income as we increase our investment and retail store pre opening costs 
our fiscal investments are expected to include a tommy bahama retail store and restaurant  which we refer to as an island location  in new york city  as well as other domestic tommy bahama retail store openings  further development of an international infrastructure for tommy bahama and related opening of 
table of contents tommy bahama retail stores in asia  and new lilly pulitzer retail locations 
while we believe that these fiscal investments will generate long term benefits  we recognize that they will have a short term  negative impact on our operating results  including the recognition of certain investment and retail store pre opening costs and the impact of lease obligations under us gaap  which requires that we recognize pre opening rent expense from the date we take possession of a leased space 
although we believe that the tailored clothing environment will continue to be very challenging in the future  we currently believe there are opportunities for moderate sales growth in our tailored clothing business  however  the competition and costing pressures in this sector may hinder operating income growth in this business 
we continue to believe that it is important to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity  and we believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with positive cash flow from operations will provide us ample resources to fund future investments in our lifestyle brands 
further  we believe we have a significant opportunity beginning on july  to improve our capital structure  when we can redeem our senior secured notes at of the principal amount of plus accrued and unpaid interest  which redemption price will decrease in subsequent years  which could result in substantial interest savings for us after that date if we can replace these notes with more attractive borrowing alternatives 
in the future  we may add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio  if we identify appropriate lifestyle brands which meet our investment criteria  however  we believe that we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands even absent any future acquisition 
background and transformation originally founded in  we have undergone a significant transformation as we migrated from our historical domestic private label manufacturing roots 
over the years we transitioned first to an international apparel design and sourcing company and ultimately to a company with a focus on owning  managing  designing  sourcing  marketing and distributing apparel products bearing prominent trademarks owned by us 
significant milestones in the last ten years include the acquisition of our tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman lifestyle brands  as well as the divestiture of certain of our private label and licensed brand operations  including our former womenswear and oxford apparel operating groups 
these acquisitions and divestitures have resulted in a dramatic change in our sales mix from fiscal  when less than of our sales were sales from products bearing brands that we owned or from direct to consumer sales 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were from products bearing brands that we own and of our net sales were direct to consumer sales 
our strategy of emphasizing company owned lifestyle branded apparel products  including those with direct to consumer opportunities  was driven in part by the continued consolidation in the retail industry and the increasing concentration of apparel manufacturing in a relatively limited number of offshore markets 
we believe that these two trends will continue to make the branded apparel and direct to consumer business models more appealing than a business focused on wholesale sales of private label apparel 
operating groups our business is primarily operated through four operating groups tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer  ben sherman and lanier clothes  each of which is described below 
we identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating

we also operate tommy bahama restaurants and license the tommy bahama name for various product categories 
during fiscal  substantially all of tommy bahama s sales were to customers within the united states 
we believe that the attraction of the tommy bahama brand to our consumers is a reflection of our efforts to ensure that we maintain appropriate quality and design of our apparel and licensed products  while also restricting the distribution of the tommy bahama products to a select tier of retailers 
we believe that the retail sales value of all tommy bahama branded products sold during fiscal  including our estimate of retail sales by our wholesale customers and other third party retailers  was approximately million

the design process includes feedback from buyers  consumers and sales agents  along with market trend research

we operate a buying office located in hong kong to manage the production and sourcing of substantially all of our tommy bahama products 
during fiscal  we utilized approximately 
table of contents suppliers  which are primarily located in china  to manufacture our tommy bahama products 
the largest ten suppliers of tommy bahama products provided approximately of the products acquired during fiscal we operate a tommy bahama distribution center in auburn  washington 
activities at the distribution center include receiving finished goods from suppliers  inspecting the products and shipping the products to our tommy bahama retail stores  our wholesale customers and our e commerce customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of tommy bahama inventory at the distribution center to support our direct to consumer operations as well as pre booked orders and anticipated sales volume of our wholesale customers 
direct to consumer operations a key component of our tommy bahama growth strategy is to operate our own retail stores and e commerce website  which we believe permits us to develop and build brand awareness by presenting our products in a setting specifically designed to showcase the aspirational lifestyle on which they are based 
our tommy bahama direct to consumer strategy includes retail store  restaurant and e commerce operations  which  in the aggregate represented approximately of tommy bahama s net sales in fiscal retail store  restaurant and e commerce net sales accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of tommy bahama s net sales in fiscal during fiscal  approximately and of our direct to consumer sales at our full price retail stores were sales of tommy bahama men s and women s products  respectively  with the remainder of the full price retail sales being home products and other accessories 
continued growth and development of our retail store operations is a critical part of our overall strategy for the tommy bahama brand 
this strategy includes locating retail stores in upscale malls  lifestyle shopping centers and resort destinations 
generally  we seek malls and shopping areas with high profile or luxury consumer brands 
our retail stores carry a wide range of merchandise  including apparel  home products and accessories  all presented in an aspirational  island inspired atmosphere designed to be relaxed  comfortable and unique 
our tommy bahama full price retail stores allow us the opportunity to present tommy bahama s full line of current season products  including home products and accessories 
we believe that the tommy bahama retail stores provide high visibility for the brand and products  and allow us to stay close to the preferences of our consumers 
we believe that our presentation of products and our strategy to limit promotional sales in our own retail stores are good for the tommy bahama brand and  in turn  enhance business with our wholesale customers 
our tommy bahama outlet stores serve an important role in overall inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out of season products at better prices than are otherwise available from outside parties  while helping us to protect the integrity of the tommy bahama brand through controlled distribution 
we operate restaurants generally adjacent to a tommy bahama full price retail store location 
these restaurants provide us with the opportunity to immerse customers in the ultimate tommy bahama island experience 
we do not anticipate that many of our retail locations will have an adjacent restaurant  however  in select high profile  brand appropriate locations  we have determined that an adjacent restaurant can further enhance the image of the brand 
generally  net sales per square foot in our full price retail stores which are adjacent to a restaurant outpaces the net sales per square foot of our typical full price retail store as we believe that the restaurant experience may entice the customer to purchase additional tommy bahama merchandise 

table of contents the table below details the number and average square feet of tommy bahama retail stores operated by us as of january  restaurant retail locations full price stores outlet stores total california florida hawaii texas nevada other total average square feet average square feet for restaurant retail locations include average retail space and restaurant space of  and  square feet  respectively 
for tommy bahama s full price retail stores and restaurant retail locations operating for the full fiscal year  sales per gross square foot  excluding restaurant sales and restaurant space  were approximately during fiscal  compared to for stores operating for the full fiscal year 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased comparable stores sales 
in fiscal  we expect to open to domestic full price and outlet locations in the aggregate  net of a certain number of relocations and closures 
although each of the specific locations and timing of store openings have not been finalized yet  we anticipate opening locations in new york and chicago  among other cities  in fiscal we currently anticipate maintaining a similar level of domestic new store openings in future years as well 
in addition to our domestic store openings  we also anticipate opening retail stores in asia including macau and singapore in fiscal and a tommy bahama restaurant retail location in tokyo in fiscal we continue to look for additional locations for retail stores in asia  including locations in china and hong kong  as we proceed with our international expansion 
the operation of retail stores and restaurant retail locations requires a greater amount of capital investment than wholesale operations 
we estimate that we will spend approximately million and million on average in connection with the build out of a full price retail store and outlet store  respectively 
however  individual locations  particularly those in urban locations including chicago  could require investments greater than these amounts depending on a variety of factors  including the location and size of store 
the cost of a restaurant retail location can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors 
historically  the cost of our restaurant retail locations has been approximately million  however  we anticipate that we will spend approximately million for the build out of our new york retail restaurant location during fiscal the international retail locations that we open in the future may be more expensive than our domestic retail stores depending on the location and size of store as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and other factors 
for certain of our retail stores  including those located in the united states  the landlord often provides certain incentives to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 
we also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires and we determine it is appropriate to relocate a retail store to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store 
the cost of retail store relocations will generally be comparable to the costs of opening a new retail store 
in addition to our new store openings and relocations  we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels of existing stores  particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term  or otherwise determine that a remodel of a retail store is appropriate

we anticipate further growth in our e commerce operations as we reach more customers in the future 
wholesale operations to complement our direct to consumer operations and have access to a larger group of consumers  we continue to maintain our wholesale operations for tommy bahama through better department stores and specialty stores 
wholesale sales for tommy bahama accounted for approximately of tommy bahama s net sales in fiscal we believe that the integrity and continued success of the tommy bahama brand is dependent in part upon careful selection of the retailers through which tommy bahama products are sold 
part of our wholesale strategy is to control the distribution of our tommy bahama products in a manner intended to protect and grow the value of the brand 
during fiscal  approximately of tommy bahama s net sales were to tommy bahama s five largest wholesale customers  with no individual customer representing greater than of tommy bahama s net sales 
we maintain tommy bahama apparel sales offices and showrooms in several locations  including new york and seattle  to facilitate sales to our wholesale customers 
our tommy bahama wholesale operations utilize a sales force primarily consisting of independent commissioned sales representatives 
licensing operations we believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for the tommy bahama brand 
for an established lifestyle brand  licensing typically requires modest additional investment for us but can yield high margin income 
it also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure

we also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed licensed products with other tommy bahama products

of the approximately million of lilly pulitzer net sales in fiscal  approximately  and of the net sales were through the wholesale  retail and e commerce distribution channels  respectively 
we believe that there is significant opportunity to expand the reach of the brand  while at the same time maintaining the exclusive distribution that lilly pulitzer has historically maintained 
we believe the attraction of the lilly pulitzer brand to our consumers is a reflection of years of effort to ensure that the appropriate quality and design of the lilly pulitzer apparel and licensed products is maintained  while also restricting the distribution of the lilly pulitzer products to a select tier of retailers 
we believe this approach to quality  design and distribution has been critical in allowing the brand to achieve the current retail price points for lilly pulitzer products

the table below provides additional information regarding lilly pulitzer retail stores as of january  number of stores florida new york pennsylvania texas other total average square feet per store retail store sales per gross square foot for fiscal were approximately for stores which were open the entire fiscal year compared to approximately for the lilly pulitzer stores open for the full calendar year  which was mostly prior to our acquisition and were not included in our results of operations 
the increase from calendar year to fiscal was primarily due to increased comparable stores sales 
during fiscal  we anticipate opening three or four lilly pulitzer retail store locations 
although the timing and locations of all of the store openings have not been finalized  we opened a store in charlotte  north carolina in february and have entered into a lease agreement for a store in atlanta  georgia 
further  we continue to work towards finding other brand appropriate locations for future stores 
we anticipate that new retail store openings will generally be in the  square foot range as we believe that a smaller store will generally provide a better return on investment than larger stores 
to open a  square foot lilly pulitzer store  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million on average 
the operation of retail stores requires a greater amount of capital investment than wholesale operations  but often the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of these capital expenditures 
we also incur capital expenditures when a lease expires and we determine it is appropriate to relocate a retail store to a new location in the same vicinity as the previous store 
the cost of retail store relocations will generally be comparable to the costs of opening a new retail store 
in addition to our new store openings and relocations  we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels of existing stores  particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term  or otherwise determine that a remodel of a retail store is appropriate

these agreements are generally for a one or two year period

our wholesale operations for lilly pulitzer utilize a sales force consisting of salaried sales employees 
licensing operations we license the lilly pulitzer trademark to licensees in categories beyond lilly pulitzer s core product categories 
in the long term  we believe licensing may be an attractive business opportunity for the lilly pulitzer brand 
once a brand is established  licensing requires modest additional investment for us but can yield high margin income 
it also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure 
in evaluating a potential lilly pulitzer licensee  we typically consider the candidate s experience  financial stability  manufacturing performance and marketing ability 
we also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed products with other lilly pulitzer brand products 
our agreements with lilly pulitzer licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future 
generally  the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty and advertising payments based on specified percentages of the licensee s net sales of the licensed products

through this buying agent and a sourcing office we operate in india  during fiscal we used approximately suppliers primarily located in china  thailand and india to manufacture our ben sherman products 
the largest ten suppliers provided approximately of the ben sherman products acquired during fiscal we use a third party distribution center in the united kingdom for our ben sherman products sold in the united kingdom and europe 
in the united states  distribution services are performed for ben sherman at our owned distribution center in lyons  georgia 
distribution center activities include receiving finished goods  inspecting the products and shipping the products to wholesale customers  our ben sherman retail stores and our e commerce customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support pre booked orders and anticipated sales volume for our wholesale customers as well as sales for our direct to consumer operations 
wholesale operations during fiscal  approximately of ben sherman s net sales were sales to wholesale customers and international distributors 
during fiscal  approximately of ben sherman s net 
table of contents sales were to its five largest customers  of which no individual customer accounted for greater than of ben sherman s net sales 
in the united states  ben sherman s products are located in specialty stores as well as better department stores 
in recent years  we have implemented certain initiatives to elevate our wholesale distribution to attain higher price points for our ben sherman men s products  reduce our infrastructure and license certain of our non core businesses to third parties to allow us to focus our resources on our core business men s sportswear 
by the end of fiscal  we had made significant strides in elevating our wholesale distribution  however  we believe we still have additional steps to achieve our ideal wholesale distribution  which may result in a further decline of wholesale sales in the short term 
we believe that the initiatives taken thus far and expected in the short term are critical steps in improving the operating results and long term returns of ben sherman 
we believe that these initiatives will provide opportunities for improved long term returns  not only in our wholesale operations  but also in our direct to consumer operations 
we maintain ben sherman apparel sales offices and showrooms in several locations  including london  new york and dusseldorf  among others 
our wholesale operations for ben sherman utilize a sales force consisting of salaried sales employees and independent commissioned sales representatives 
direct to consumer operations our direct to consumer strategy for the ben sherman brand includes locating retail stores in higher end malls and brand appropriate street locations 
each retail store carries a wide range of merchandise  including apparel  footwear and accessories  all presented in a manner intended to enhance the ben sherman image 
our full price ben sherman retail stores allow the opportunity to present ben sherman s full line of current season products  including licensees products 
we believe our ben sherman retail stores provide high visibility of the brand and products and also enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of consumers 
we believe the presentation of these products in our ben sherman retail stores helps build brand awareness and acceptance and thus enhances business with our wholesale customers 
our outlet stores in the united kingdom serve an important role in the overall inventory management by allowing us to sell discontinued and out of season products at better prices than are generally otherwise available from outside parties  while helping us protect the ben sherman brand by controlling the distribution of such products 
the table below provides additional information regarding ben sherman retail stores as of january  number of stores average square feet united states full price stores united kingdom full price stores germany full price stores united kingdom and europe outlet stores total during fiscal  approximately of ben sherman s net sales were from owned retail store operations 
retail sales per gross square foot were approximately for our full price ben sherman stores open throughout fiscal compared to for the full price ben sherman stores open throughout fiscal the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to increased comparable stores sales  the close of two larger footprint  underperforming store locations and foreign currency exchange rate changes 
we continue to evaluate potential locations and may open retail stores in fiscal if we identify locations which meet our investment criteria 
the operation of our retail stores requires a greater amount of capital investment than wholesale operations 
based on recent store 
table of contents openings  we have spent approximately million of capital expenditures on average to build out a ben sherman full price retail store 
often  the landlord provides certain incentives to fund a portion of these capital expenditures 
in addition to our new store openings  we also incur capital expenditure costs related to remodels of existing stores  particularly when we renew or extend a lease beyond the original lease term  or otherwise determine that a remodel of a retail store is appropriate  which occurred with our carnaby street  london remodel in fiscal another component of our direct to consumer strategy is operating certain concession arrangements  whereby we operate ben sherman shops within department or other stores 
the inventory at these locations is owned by us until sold to the consumer  at which time we recognize the full retail sales price 
in these arrangements  we are responsible for the cost of the ben sherman employee responsible for the area and also pay a commission to the department store to cover occupancy and certain other costs associated with using the space 
as of january   we operated concession locations in the united kingdom 
late in fiscal  we re launched the bensherman 
com website in the united kingdom and europe  which provides consumers the opportunity to purchase ben sherman products directly on line 
we anticipate re launching our ben sherman us site during fiscal although the net sales impact of ben sherman s e commerce operations is not currently significant  we believe that the ben sherman customer base will embrace a high quality  brand appropriate e commerce site 
licensing distributor operations we license the ben sherman trademark to a variety of licensees in categories beyond ben sherman s core product categories  including footwear and kids apparel 
we believe licensing is an attractive business opportunity for the ben sherman brand 
once a brand is established  licensing requires modest additional investment for us but can yield high margin income 
it also affords the opportunity to enhance overall brand awareness and exposure 
in evaluating a potential ben sherman licensee  we typically consider the candidate s experience  financial stability  manufacturing performance and marketing ability 
we also evaluate the marketability and compatibility of the proposed products with other ben sherman brand products 
our agreements with ben sherman licensees are for specific geographic areas and expire at various dates in the future 
generally  the agreements require minimum royalty payments as well as royalty and advertising payments based on specified percentages of the licensee s net sales of the licensed products 
our license agreements generally provide us the right to approve all products  advertising and proposed channels of distribution 
third party license arrangements for ben sherman products include the following product categories footwear kid s apparel men s backpacks and travel bags men s tailored clothes and dress shirts men s and boys watches and jewelry men s neckwear and pocket squares men s and women s eyewear men s and boys underwear  socks and sleepwear men s fragrances and toiletries men s hats  caps  scarves and gloves men s gift products in addition to the license agreements for the specific product categories listed above  we have also entered into certain international license distribution agreements which give these third parties the opportunity to distribute ben sherman products in certain geographic areas around the world 
many of the products sold by our licensees distributors are identical to the products sold in the united kingdom 
table of contents and united states 
we believe there is potential for further penetration into these and other markets for the ben sherman brand 
in most markets  our licensees distributors are required to open retail stores in their respective geographic regions 
as of january   our licensees distributors operated ben sherman retail stores located in australia  asia  south africa  europe and canada 
lanier clothes lanier clothes designs  sources and markets branded and private label men s tailored clothing  including suits  sportcoats  suit separates and dress slacks across a wide range of price points  with the majority of the business at moderate price points

additionally  we design and market products for our owned billy london and arnold brant brands 
billy london is a modern  british inspired fashion brand geared towards the value oriented consumer  while arnold brant is an upscale tailored brand that is intended to blend modern elements of style with affordable luxury 
in addition to the branded businesses  lanier clothes designs and sources private label tailored clothing products for certain customers 
we believe that this private label business appropriately complements our branded tailored clothing businesses 
significant private label brands for which we produce tailored clothing include lands end  stafford  alfani  structure  and kenneth roberts 
sales of branded products represented approximately of lanier clothes net sales during fiscal our lanier clothes products are sold to national chains  department stores  specialty stores  specialty catalog retailers and discount retailers throughout the united states 
in lanier clothes  we have long standing relationships with some of the united states largest retailers  with sears which includes lands end  men s wearhouse  macy s  burlington coat factory and jcpenney representing approximately    and  respectively  of lanier clothes net sales during fiscal sales to lanier clothes largest customers represented approximately of lanier clothes net sales in fiscal the amount and percentage of net sales attributable to an individual customer in future years may be different than fiscal amounts as sales are typically on an order by order or specific program basis and not tied to long term contracts 
the tailored clothing market is an extremely competitive apparel sector that is experiencing gross margin pressures due to sourcing cost increases and increased competition 
we continue to believe that the opportunities for branded tailored clothing are better than private label tailored clothing  although the challenges in branded tailored clothing are significant 
we believe that our lanier clothes business has excelled at bringing quality products to our customers and managing inventory risk appropriately  resulting in low double digit operating margins  while requiring minimal capital expenditure investments 
design  manufacturing  sourcing and distribution we believe that superior customer service and supply chain management  as well as the design of quality products  are all integral components of our strategy in the branded and private label tailored clothing market 
our lanier clothes design teams  which are located in new york  focus on the target consumer for each brand 
the design process combines feedback from buyers and sales agents along with market trend research 
lanier clothes manages production in asia and latin america through a combination of efforts from our lanier clothes offices in atlanta  georgia and third party buying agents 
during fiscal  approximately of lanier clothes product purchases were from manufacturers located in china  compared to approximately in fiscal  as certain production was shifted away from factories in china to vietnam and india during fiscal lanier clothes purchased goods from approximately suppliers in fiscal the ten largest suppliers of lanier clothes provided approximately of 
table of contents the raw materials and finished goods lanier clothes acquired from third parties during fiscal in addition to purchasing products from third parties  lanier clothes also operates a manufacturing facility  located in merida  mexico  which produced approximately of our lanier clothes products during fiscal our various lanier clothes products are manufactured from a variety of fibers  including wool  silk  linen  cotton and other natural fibers  as well as synthetics and blends of these materials 
the majority of the materials used in lanier clothes manufacturing operations are purchased in the form of woven finished fabrics directly from various offshore fabric mills 
for lanier clothes  we utilize a distribution center located in toccoa  georgia  where we receive goods from our suppliers  inspect those products and ship the goods to our customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support programs for pre booked orders and to meet increased customer demand for at once ordering 
for certain standard tailored clothing product styles  we maintain in stock replenishment programs  providing shipment to customers within just a few days of receiving the order 
these types of programs generally require higher inventory levels 
disposal of excess prior season inventory is an ongoing part of our business 
we maintain apparel sales offices and showrooms for our lanier clothes products in several locations  including new york and atlanta 
we employ a sales force for lanier clothes primarily consisting of salaried employees 
lanier clothes also operates the www

oxford golf maintains an apparel sales office in new york  while employing a sales force consisting primarily of commissioned sales agents 
our lyons  georgia distribution center receives finished goods from suppliers  inspects those products and ships the products to customers for our oxford golf business 
advertising and marketing we believe that advertising and marketing are an integral part of the long term strategy of our brands  and we therefore devote significant resources to advertising and marketing our brands 
during fiscal  we spent approximately million on advertising  marketing and promoting our products 
for each of our lifestyle brands  we incurred advertising  marketing and promotions expenses of approximately to of net sales of the respective lifestyle brand during fiscal each of our operating groups manages the advertising  marketing and promotion of its brands 
while the advertising of our lifestyle brands promotes our products  the primary emphasis is on brand image and brand lifestyle 
we intend that the advertising will engage individuals within the brand s distinct consumer demographic and guide them on a regular basis to our retail stores  e commerce websites or 
table of contents wholesale customers stores in search of our products 
the marketing of our lifestyle brands continues to include traditional media such as print  catalogs and other correspondence with customers  as well as moving media and tradeshow initiatives 
however  an increasing amount of our marketing focus involves email  internet and social media advertising 
we believe that it is very important that we communicate regularly with our consumers via the use of email  internet and social media about product offerings or other brand events in order to maintain and strengthen our brands connections with our consumers 
we also believe that highly visible retail store locations with creative design  broad merchandise selection and brand appropriate visual presentation are key enticements for customers to visit our retail stores and buy merchandise 
we intend that our retail stores enhance the retail experience of our customers  which we believe will increase consumer brand loyalty 
marketing initiatives at certain of our retail stores may include special event promotions and a variety of public relations activities designed to create awareness of our stores and products 
we believe that our retail store operations as well as our traditional media and electronic media communications increase the sales of our own retail stores and e commerce operations  as well as the sales of our products for our wholesale customers 
for certain of our wholesale customers we also provide point of sale materials and signage to enhance the presentation of our branded products at their retail locations and or participate in cooperative advertising programs 
trademarks as discussed above  we own trademarks  several of which are very important to our business 
generally  our significant trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel and  in some cases  apparel related products  accessories  home furnishings and beauty products  as well as in connection with retail services 
we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of certain of our trademarks 
in general  trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services and the required registration renewals are filed 
our significant trademarks are discussed within each operating group description 
important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
product sourcing we intend to maintain a flexible  diversified  cost effective manufacturing base that provides high quality branded products 
each of our operating groups  either internally or through the use of third party buying agents  source substantially all of our products from non exclusive  third party producers located in foreign countries 
the use of contract manufacturers reduces the amount of capital investment required by us as operating manufacturing facilities can require a significant amount of capital investment 
during fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products from producers located in china 
although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers and have used many of our suppliers for a number of years  generally we do not have long term contracts with our suppliers 
instead  we conduct business on an order by order basis 
thus  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we believe that this approach provides us with the greatest flexibility in identifying the appropriate manufacturers while considering quality  cost  timing of product delivery and other criteria while also utilizing the expertise of the manufacturers 
during fiscal  no individual third party manufacturer supplied more than of our product purchases 
we purchase substantially all of our tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products from our third party producers as package purchases of finished goods  which are manufactured with our oversight to our design and fabric specifications 
for package purchases  we regularly depend upon 
table of contents the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials specified by us  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity rather than us providing or financing the costs of these items 
we believe that our focus on acquiring package purchases allows us to reduce our working capital requirements as we generally are not required to purchase  or finance the purchase of  the raw materials or other production costs related to our product purchases until we take ownership of the finished goods  which typically occurs when the goods are shipped by the third party producers 
for our lanier clothes operating group  we acquired the majority of our lanier clothes products during fiscal on a package purchase basis from third party producers 
the remainder of the inventory purchases from third parties were primarily on a cmt basis  which we consider to be purchases whereby we supply the fabric and purchase cut  sew and finish labor or cut  make  trim from our third party producers 
as the ability and willingness of third party tailored clothing apparel manufacturers to finance raw materials purchases continues to increase along with other changes in sourcing practices for tailored clothing  we anticipate that lanier clothes will continue to increase the percentage of goods acquired as package purchases of finished goods rather than cmt purchases 
in addition to purchasing products from third parties  lanier clothes also operates our only owned manufacturing facility  which is located in merida  mexico  and produced approximately of our lanier clothes products during fiscal as the manufacture and transportation of apparel products for our brands may take as many as six months for each season  we typically make commitments months in advance of when products will arrive in our retail stores or our customers stores 
we continue to seek ways to reduce the time required from design and ordering to bringing products to our customer 
while our merchandising departments can anticipate our requirements for finished goods purchases for our own retail stores and e commerce sites based on historical product demand data and other factors  purchases for our wholesale accounts must be committed to and purchased by us prior to the receipt of customer orders in some cases 
if we overestimate the demand for a particular product for our retail stores or our wholesale customers  we could be faced with substantial excess inventory  however  we believe excess purchases can generally be distributed in our outlet stores  as applicable  or through secondary wholesale distribution channels 
generally  we attempt to limit our purchases in excess of orders received from customers  but as a result inventory available for in season replenishment requests by our customers may not be available for certain seasonal products 
we are committed to sourcing our products in a lawful and responsible manner 
as part of this commitment  each of our operating groups has implemented a code of conduct program applicable to vendors that we purchase goods from  which includes provisions related to abiding by applicable laws as well as compliance with other business ethics  including related human rights  health  safety  working conditions  environmental and other requirements 
we require that each of our vendors comply with the applicable code of conduct 
on an ongoing basis we assess vendors compliance with the applicable code of conduct through assessments performed by either our employees or our designated agents 
in the event we determine that a vendor is not abiding by the applicable code of conduct  we work with the vendor to remediate the violation 
if the violation is not remediated  we generally will discontinue use of the vendor 
import restrictions and other government regulations we are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations 
almost all of our merchandise is manufactured by foreign suppliers 
during fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products acquired from china 
our imported products are subject to customs  trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the united states and other countries where we sell our products 
from time to time and in the ordinary course of business  we become subject to claims by the 
table of contents united states customs service and similar government authorities in other countries for duties and related fees 
substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product 
duty rates vary depending on the type of garment and its fiber content 
during fiscal  cotton products represented approximately one half of our total imported products and were subject to an average duty rate of approximately  while silk and linen products represented approximately of our total imported products and were subject to an average duty rate of approximately 
duty rates are subject to change in future periods 
quotas on apparel and textiles among the world trade organization s member nations were eliminated effective january  and resulted in the continued shift of sourcing and manufacturing from the western hemisphere to asia 
although china s accession agreement for membership in the wto resulted in the elimination of quotas on chinese made textile and apparel products into wto countries  the united states and european countries are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose anti dumping duties in response to a particular product being imported from china or other countries in such increased quantities as to cause  or threaten to cause  serious damage to the comparable domestic industry 
in addition  countervailing duties are other duties which can be imposed by the united states in cases where it finds that subsidies are being provided by a foreign government to its manufacturers and where this subsidized merchandise causes or threatens to cause damage to the comparable domestic us industry 
additionally  there have been some recent legislative proposals which  if adopted  would treat manipulation by china of the value of its currency as actionable under the anti dumping or countervailing duty laws 
if the united states or the united kingdom were to impose anti dumping or countervailing duties on products that we import in the future  it would increase the cost of those products to us and we may not be able to pass on any such cost increases to our customers 
in january  the united states customs service began enforcement of a regulation requiring importer security filings 
the regulation requires us to submit additional cargo details before the cargo is loaded onto an ocean vessel bound for the united states 
we could become subject to penalties and or delays in obtaining our products from the united states customs service if we fail to comply with these existing or future regulations 
similar customs import regulations went into effect on january  in the european union  where a significant majority of ben sherman s net sales are generated 
in addition  apparel and other products sold by us are subject to increasingly stringent and complex product performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations  including the consumer product safety improvement act of  california proposition and those adopted by the federal trade commission 
these regulations relate principally to product labeling  licensing requirements and certification of product safety 
we believe that we are in compliance with those regulations 
our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation 
our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations  and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on our business or results of operations 
although we have not been materially inhibited from doing business in desired markets in the past  we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets 
our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment  including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products from china and other countries 
important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 

table of contents information technologies we believe that sophisticated information systems are an important component of maintaining our competitive position and supporting continued growth of our businesses 
our management information systems were designed to provide effective retail store  e commerce and wholesale operations while emphasizing efficient point of sale  distribution center  design  sourcing  order processing  marketing  accounting and other functions 
in our retail stores we use point of sale registers that capture sales data  track inventories and monitor traffic and other information for our retail stores 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our information technologies and upgrade or enhance our systems to gain operating efficiencies and to support our anticipated growth as well as other changes in our business 
we believe that continuous upgrading and enhancements to our management information systems with newer technology that offers greater efficiency  functionality and reporting capabilities is important to our operations and financial condition 
seasonal aspects of business our operating groups are impacted by seasonality 
for details of the impact of seasonality on our operating groups and consolidated operating results  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
order backlog as of january  and january   we had booked orders for our wholesale businesses totaling million and million  respectively  substantially all of which we expect will be or were shipped within six months after each such date 
once we receive a specific purchase order  the dollar value of such order is included in our booked orders 
a portion of our business  particularly in our lanier clothes operating group  consists of at once edi quick response programs with large retailers 
replenishment shipments under these programs generally have such an abbreviated order life that they are excluded from the order backlog completely 
we do not believe that this backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods as the timing of wholesale customer orders  and therefore the order backlog  can be impacted by a variety of factors 
additionally  direct to consumer sales are never reflected in our booked orders as those sales are dependent upon future consumer purchases 
as our sales continue to shift towards direct to consumer rather than wholesale sales  the amount of our booked orders may be less meaningful as a measure of our future results of operations 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately were employed in the united states 
approximately of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees 
we believe our employee relations are good

risk factors the risks described below highlight some of the factors that could materially affect our operations 
if any of these risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties we face 
we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing business environment  and additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact us 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and our success depends on the reputation and value of our brand names and our ability to offer innovative and market appropriate products that respond to rapidly changing fashion trends  any failure to maintain the reputation or value of our brands  to offer innovative  fashionable and desirable brands and products and or to appropriately respond to competitive factors within our industry could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are the reputation  value and image of our brand names  design  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing  and customer service 
the value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us or by our wholesale customers or others  including marketing partners  who have interests in the brands  including by failing to respond to emerging fashion trends or by becoming overly promotional 
we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers or other third parties and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing efforts or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations 
during fiscal  tommy bahama s net sales represented approximately of our consolidated net sales  while lilly pulitzer s and ben sherman s net sales represented approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
the limited diversification in our portfolio may heighten the risks we face if one of our brands fails to meet our expectations and or is adversely impacted by any actions we or third parties take with respect to that brand or by competitive conditions in the apparel industry 
although certain of our products carry over from season to season  the apparel industry in general  and to a heightened degree in recent years due to the emergence of social media tools  is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands  particularly for our lifestyle branded tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products 
accordingly  we must anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry  there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers preferences  fashion trends and changes in consumer demographics 
as is typical with new products  market acceptance of new price points and designs is subject to uncertainty 
the introduction or repositioning of new lines and products and the entry of our products into new geographic territories often requires substantial costs in design  marketing and advertising  which may not be recovered if the products are not successful 
any failure on our part to develop appealing products and update core products could result in lower sales  operating losses and or harm the reputation and desirability of our brands 
additionally  since we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured  such a failure could leave us with a substantial amount of unsold excess inventory  which we may be forced to sell at lower price points 
the highly competitive apparel industry includes numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers  manufacturers  distributors  importers  licensors and retailers  some of whom may also be our customers and some of whom are significantly larger  more diversified and have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
the level and nature of our competition varies  and the number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other markets or product lines or as other companies expand into our markets or product lines 
certain of our competitors offer apparel for sale at significant discounts  particularly in response to weak economic conditions  which 
table of contents results in more pressure to reduce prices or the risk that our products may not be as desirable as lower priced products 
competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales  increased costs  lower prices for our products and or decreased margins 
we also license certain of our brands  including tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  to third party licensees 
while we enter into comprehensive license agreements with these third parties covering product design  product quality  sourcing  manufacturing and marketing requirements and approvals  there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products or due to the actions of a licensee 
the improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands 
in addition  the reputation of our brands could be harmed if our third party manufacturers and vendors  substantially all of which are located outside the united states  fail to meet our product safety  product quality and social compliance standards 
we cannot assure that our manufacturers and vendors will at all times conduct their operations in accordance with ethical practices or that the products we purchase will always meet our safety and quality control standards 
any violation of our applicable codes of conduct or local laws relating to labor conditions by our manufacturers or vendors or other actions or failures by us or such parties may result in negative public perception of our brands or products  as well as disrupt our supply chain  adversely affecting our business operations 
the apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic conditions  and a deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or consumer purchases of discretionary products may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
demand for our products is significantly impacted by trends in consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending  which may be influenced by employment levels  recessions  fuel and energy costs  availability of personal credit  interest rates  tax rates and changes in tax laws  personal debt levels  housing prices  stock market volatility  general political conditions and other factors 
the factors impacting consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending are outside of our control and difficult to predict  and  often  the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy 
starting in and continuing through  the economies of the united states  united kingdom and other parts of the world weakened as a result of the global economic crisis 
we saw modest improvement in economic conditions in the united states during fiscal and through fiscal however  the european sovereign debt crisis and its impact on global financial systems continues to result in volatility in the european markets  and unstable political conditions in the middle east and some other parts of the world have created significant global economic and political uncertainties  which could have an adverse impact on consumer demand for our products and also result in disruptions to sourcing of our products from foreign markets 
there are no assurances that the united states or global economy will recover in the near future or that recessionary conditions will not return to these markets  and any deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or discretionary consumer spending could reduce our sales  increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices 
additionally  significant changes in the operations or liquidity of any of the parties with which we conduct our business  including suppliers  customers  trademark licensees and lenders  among others  now or in the future  or in the access to capital markets for any such parties  could result in lower demand for our products  lower sales  higher costs or other disruptions in our business 

table of contents changes in international trade regulation and risks relating to the importation of our products may cause our products to become less competitive  disrupt our supply chain and or adversely affect our operations 
as we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries  including making approximately of our product purchases from china during fiscal  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate 
some of the risks associated with importing our products from foreign countries include quotas imposed by countries in which our products are manufactured or countries into which our products are imported  which limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from or into these countries  changes in social  political  labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located  the imposition of additional or new duties  tariffs  taxes or other changes and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such changes  significant delays in the delivery of our products  due to security or other considerations  fluctuations in sourcing costs  the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties  fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries 
our  or any of our suppliers  failure to comply with customs or similar laws or any other applicable regulations could restrict our ability to import products or lead to fines  penalties or adverse publicity  and future regulatory actions or trade agreements may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or materially increase our costs 
we rely to a large extent on third party producers in foreign countries to meet our production demands and failures by these producers to meet our requirements  or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices  may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales 
we source substantially all of our products from non exclusive  third party producers located in foreign countries 
although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers  generally we do not have long term contracts but  instead  conduct business on an order by order basis 
therefore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity 
although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations  we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers  such as the reduction of availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis  which may  in turn  have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales 
loss of one or more of our key wholesale customers  or a significant adverse change in a customer s financial performance or financial position could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generate a significant percentage of our wholesale sales from a few major customers 
during fiscal  sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated wholesale sales and sales to our largest wholesale customer represented approximately of our consolidated wholesale sales 
a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products  restructuring of our customers operations  more centralized purchasing decisions  direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers  as a result of further consolidation in the retail industry or otherwise could 
table of contents result in lower prices  realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generally do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
instead  we rely on long standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
a decision by one or more of our major customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us  whether motivated by competitive considerations  quality or style issues  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our net sales and profitability  as it would be difficult to immediately  if at all  replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers 
in addition  due to long product lead times  our product lines are typically designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale 
we make commitments for production in connection with these lines 
these commitments can be made up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers  and if orders do not materialize or are canceled  we may incur expenses to terminate our production commitments or to dispose of excess inventories 
we also extend credit to several of our key customers without requiring collateral  which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers 
companies in the apparel industry  including some of our customers  may continue to experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcies  restructurings and reorganizations  tightened credit markets and or declining sales and profitability on a comparable store basis 
a significant adverse change in a customer s financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer s receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous shipments to that customer 
our operations are reliant on information technology and any interruption or other failure  including at one of our principal distribution facilities  may impair our ability to provide products to our customers and meet the needs of management 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and as a method of communication with our customers and suppliers 
additionally  certain of our operating groups utilize e commerce websites to sell goods directly to consumers 
our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results 
service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors  including power outages  computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or failures to properly install  upgrade  integrate  protect  repair or maintain our systems and e commerce websites 
we regularly evaluate upgrades or enhancements to our information systems to more efficiently and competitively operate our business and are in the process of upgrading certain of our businesses systems to an integrated financial system 
we may experience difficulties during this implementation and or not be equipped to address system problems 
any material disruption in our information technology systems  or any failure to timely  efficiently and effectively integrate new systems  could have an adverse affect on our business or results of operations 
in addition  our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities  some of which are owned and others of which are operated by third parties 
finished garments from our contractors are inspected and stored at these distribution facilities 
if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  including as a result of natural or man made disasters  cybersecurity attacks  computer viruses or otherwise  if our 
table of contents distribution facilities fail to upgrade their technological systems to ensure efficient operations  or if the goods in the distribution center were otherwise unavailable for shipment  as a result of a technology failure or otherwise  we could experience a reduction in sales  a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility or to restore the technological capabilities of the facility 
this could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships 
breaches of information security or privacy could damage our reputation or credibility 
as an ongoing part of our business operations  including marketing through various social media tools  we regularly collect and utilize sensitive and confidential personal information 
the regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers  employees and others is complex  and the security of personal information is a matter of public concern 
despite our implementation of security measures  if an actual or perceived data security breach occurs  whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks  computer viruses  vandalism  human error or otherwise  our reputation and credibility could be damaged and we could experience lost sales 
in addition  privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently  and compliance with them may require us to modify our operations and or incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes  or our failure with these laws and regulations could lead to fines  penalties or adverse publicity 
our business is subject to various federal  foreign  state and local laws and regulations  and the costs of compliance with  or the violation of  such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations 
in the united states  we are subject to increasingly stringent and complex standards  laws and other regulations  including those relating to health  product performance and safety  labor  employment  privacy and data security  consumer protection  taxation  logistics and similar operational issues 
these laws and regulations include among others the consumer product safety improvement act of and california proposition  particularly given the concentration of our retail stores in the state of california  as well as a wide range of state and local laws and regulations governing employment  safety and other matters that impact our retail and restaurant operations 
in addition  operating in foreign jurisdictions  including those where we may open retail stores in the future  requires compliance with similar laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are complex and often vary widely by jurisdiction  making it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently or will be in the future compliant with all applicable laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business 
in addition  the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  all of our tommy bahama restaurants serve alcohol and  therefore  maintain liquor licenses 
our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant 
additionally  as a participant in the restaurant industry  we face risks related to food quality  food borne illness  injury  health inspection scores and labor relations 
regardless of whether allegations related to these matters are valid or whether we become liable  we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these issues 
the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants  as well as the image of the tommy bahama brand as a whole 

table of contents our business depends on our senior management and other key personnel  and the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business  our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
our senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries 
our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization  including the members of our senior management 
competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense  and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies which may have greater financial resources 
in addition  we will need to plan for the succession of our senior management and successfully integrate new members of management within our organization 
this may include situations in which individuals join our company as a result of acquisitions that we make and may be more familiar with certain of the operational aspects of acquired businesses than other members of our management  such as our employment of the pre acquisition principals of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations to lead our lilly pulitzer group 
the unexpected loss of any of our senior management  or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership  could negatively affect our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
the acquisition of new businesses has certain inherent risks  including  for example  strains on our management team  unexpected acquisition costs  and  in some instances  contingent payments 
from time to time  we acquire new businesses or product lines when we believe appropriate investment opportunities are available 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we acquired the lilly pulitzer brand and operations 
as a result of acquisitions  we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence 
although we may be entitled to indemnification against undisclosed liabilities from the sellers of the acquired business  we cannot be certain that the indemnification  even if obtained  will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or assets acquired 
any of these liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  integrating acquired businesses is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the integration process for newly acquired businesses could create for us a number of challenges and adverse consequences associated with the integration of product lines  employees  sales teams and outsourced manufacturers  employee turnover  including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses  disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines  maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses 
further  we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
in connection with our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the selling shareholders that may require us to pay up to an aggregate of million in performance based contingent payments over a period ending in although we are only required to make these payments if the acquired business is successful  the contingent payments are payable based on that business achieving earnings targets 
as of january   the selling shareholders had earned million in contingent consideration payments under this agreement based on our lilly pulitzer group s financial results during fiscal if lilly pulitzer is successful but the rest of our business is not successful  we may have difficulty making the contingent payments 
the principal shareholders from whom we acquired the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  
table of contents are key members of management of our lilly pulitzer group 
it is possible that their interests with respect to the contingent payments will differ from our interests or those of our shareholders 
we may be unable to grow our business through organic growth and or  if and when appropriate  acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model  and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
one component of our business strategy is to grow our business through organic growth and or  if and when appropriate  acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model  such as our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations in december organic growth may be achieved by  among other things  increasing our market share in existing markets  including to existing wholesale customers  selling our products in new markets  including international markets  increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels  and increasing the product offerings within our various operating groups 
successful growth of our business through organic growth and or acquisitions is subject to  among other things  the ability of our management to implement plans for expanding our existing businesses and our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future 
we may not be successful in this regard  and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
we make use of debt to finance our operations  which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business  investments in acquisitions and working capital and divestitures 
as of january   we had million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior secured notes  no borrowings outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement and million in borrowings outstanding under our uk revolving credit agreement 
our debt levels may increase in the future under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities  or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements in the future may change 
our indebtedness includes  and any future indebtedness may include  certain obligations and limitations  including the periodic payment of principal and interest  maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations related to additional debt  dividend payments  investments and dispositions of assets 
our ability to satisfy these obligations will be dependent upon our business  financial condition and operating results  and obligations and limitations under future financing arrangements may be more onerous than those currently in effect 
these obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate 
in addition  we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement 
our exposure to variable rate indebtedness may increase in the future  based on our working capital needs and or the terms of future financing arrangements 
we have not historically engaged in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk  and an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds from operations towards interest  even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same 
as a result  we may have to revise or delay our business plans  reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations 
although we believe we may have an opportunity to reduce our interest expense for future periods by redeeming our senior secured notes  there are no assurances that financing opportunities on terms that are satisfactory will be available to us in order to redeem these notes 
our senior secured notes are redeemable  at our option  beginning on july   on not less than nor more 
table of contents than days prior notice at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  which redemption price will decrease in subsequent years 
in particular  continued instability in global financial markets may limit our access to credit or capital markets at appropriate times or on acceptable terms 
restricted access to financing opportunities may also make it difficult for us to replace our us revolving credit agreement  which together with cash from operations provides us with access to funds for working capital purposes  when it matures in august on terms that are desirable 
fluctuations and volatility in the cost and availability of raw materials  labor and freight may materially increase our costs 
most of the products we purchase from third party producers are package purchases  which means that we purchase the finished goods manufactured to our design and fabric specifications from third party producers whom we rely on to secure the fabric and raw materials 
we and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices 
the principal fabrics used in our business are cotton  linens  wools  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials 
the prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them 
in addition  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodity prices and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  can fluctuate 
the cost and availability of raw materials and materials used in the manufacturing process for our products may be further impacted by legislation and regulations associated with global climate change 
during fiscal  we saw a sustained increase in the costs of raw materials  particularly cotton  as a result of rising demand from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton 
we historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices 
we are also dependent on the availability of raw materials for our suppliers 
our suppliers may experience shortages of raw materials  which could also result in delays in deliveries of our products 
during fiscal  we saw increases in the cost of labor at many of our suppliers  particularly in china which experienced labor shortages in certain areas  as the value of the us dollar declined  as well as in freight costs  resulting from increased oil prices and unrest in the middle east 
we believe that these cost pressures may not be alleviated in the near future and could increase 
although we attempt to mitigate the effect of increases in our cost of goods sold through sourcing initiatives and by selectively increasing the prices of our products  any significant or sustained increase in the price of raw materials  labor and or freight or other variable costs associated with our sourcing of products may materially increase our costs  and we may be unable to fully pass on these costs to our customers 
our geographical concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks 
our retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the united states  including florida and california for our tommy bahama retail stores  florida for our lilly pulitzer retail stores and the united kingdom for our ben sherman retail stores 
as of january   out of our tommy bahama retail stores were located in california and florida  five out of our lilly pulitzer retail stores were located in florida and out of our owned ben sherman retail stores were located in the united kingdom 
additionally  a significant portion of our wholesale sales for tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products are concentrated in the same geographic areas as our own retail store locations for these brands 
due to this concentration  we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions  including general economic conditions  weather patterns  natural disasters  changing demographics and other factors 

table of contents we may not be successful in identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores and restaurants 
an integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our lifestyle brands 
net sales from our retail stores and restaurants were approximately of our consolidated net sales during fiscal we expect to increase the number of our retail stores and restaurants during fiscal and in future years  including opening tommy bahama retail stores in geographic territories where we have not previously operated tommy bahama retail stores 
successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends  in part  on our ability to identify desirable  brand appropriate retail locations  the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make store sales volume profitable  and our ability to negotiate satisfactory lease terms and employ qualified personnel 
if we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level or the local market reception to a new retail store opening is inconsistent with our expectations  retail growth may be limited 
further  if existing retail stores and restaurants do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume  it could have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin  and results of operations 
from time to time  we seek to downsize or close some of our retail store or restaurant operations  which may require a modification or termination of an existing lease  such actions may require payment of exit fees and or result in fixed asset impairment charges  the amounts of which could be material 
in addition  continued consolidation within the commercial real estate development  operation and or management industries may further concentrate our base of retail store locations to a small number of third party landlords and reduce our leverage with those parties  thereby materially adversely affecting the terms of future leases for our retail stores and restaurants or making entering into long term commitments with such parties cost prohibitive 
we anticipate expanding our operations internationally in fiscal  including opening new tommy bahama retail stores in various jurisdictions in asia  and these efforts may not be successful 
we currently operate ben sherman retail stores in the united kingdom and various jurisdictions in europe 
in addition  ben sherman products can be found throughout europe  as well as globally 
we anticipate opening tommy bahama retail stores in asia  including macau and singapore in fiscal and a tommy bahama island in tokyo in fiscal we continue to look for additional locations for retail stores in asia  including locations in china and hong kong  as we proceed with our tommy bahama international expansion 
expanding our operations internationally requires significant capital investment and long term commitments  and there are risks associated with doing business in these markets  including  understanding fashion trends and satisfying consumer tastes  including understanding sizing and fitting in these markets  market acceptance of our products  establishing appropriate logistics functions and operational infrastructure  managing compliance with the various legal requirements  staffing and managing foreign operations  fluctuations in exchange rates  the absence of intellectual property protection  obtaining governmental approvals that may be required to operate  potentially adverse tax implications  local regulations relating to employment and retail and restaurant operations  and maintaining proper levels of inventory 
if we are unable to properly manage these risks or if our international expansion efforts do not prove successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our internet operations subject us to risks that could adversely affect our results and operations 
certain of our brands  including tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  distribute products through their ecommerce websites and communicate with consumers through social media and other methods of digital marketing 
these operations subject us to numerous risks that could adversely 
table of contents affect our results and operations  including diversion of sales from our brick and mortar retail stores  failure to properly communicate our brand message or recreate the ambiance of our retail stores  reliance on third party service providers for software  processing and similar services  liability for website content  credit card fraud  and failure of computer systems  theft of personal consumer information and computer viruses 
if we are unable to properly manage these risks  we may lose sales and or our reputation and credibility may be damaged 
our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we schedule production from third party manufacturers based on our expectations for the demand for our products 
however  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory  which may result in inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices 
these events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands 
conversely  we may not be in a position to order quality products from our manufacturers in a timely manner and or we may experience inventory shortages as demand for our products increases  which might result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  diminish brand loyalty and result in lost sales  any of which could harm our business 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property 
we believe that our registered and common law trademarks and other intellectual property  as well as other contractual arrangements  including licenses and other proprietary intellectual property rights  have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal were attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark 
therefore  our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property 
we rely on laws in the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed  causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark disputes  as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  including internationally  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful  we may be required to pay damages  royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using  or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
litigation and other legal action of this type  regardless of whether it is successful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
our international operations  including foreign sourcing  result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the united states 
substantially all of our orders for the production of apparel in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future  then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers  which would negatively impact 
table of contents our margins 
however  if the value of the us dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product  the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies  and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices 
additionally  currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance 
we received us dollars for approximately of our product sales during fiscal the sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
as we increase our operations in foreign markets  the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies would be expected to increase 
an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods 
in addition  to the extent that a stronger us dollar increases costs  and the products are sold in another currency  but the additional cost cannot be passed on to our customers  our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
we hold licenses for the use of other parties brand names  and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names 
we have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names  such as kenneth cole  dockers  geoffrey beene and ike behar  to market some of our products 
approximately of our net sales during fiscal related to the products for which we license the use of the trademark for specific product categories 
these license and design agreements will expire at various dates in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks 
the termination or expiration of a license agreement will cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets 
in addition to certain compliance obligations  all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year  which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products 
if these thresholds are not met  our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved 
in addition  our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties  and we are unable to control the quality of these goods that others produce 
if licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates  our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline 
our operations are influenced by weather patterns and natural or man made disasters 
our sales volume and operations may be adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions or natural or man made disasters  which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations 
because of the seasonality of our business  the concentration of a significant proportion of our retail stores and wholesale customers in certain geographic regions  the concentration of our sourcing operations in china and the concentration of our distribution operations  the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents divestitures of certain businesses or discontinuations of certain product lines may require us to find alternative uses for our resources 
from time to time  we may decide to divest or discontinue certain operations  as we did in fiscal with the sale of substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel group and as we did during the preceding years with the restructuring of our operations at certain of our operating groups 
divestitures of certain businesses that do not align with our strategy or the discontinuation of certain product lines which may not provide the returns that we expect or desire may result in underutilization of our resources in the event that the operations are not replaced with new lines of business either internally or through acquisition 
there can be no guarantee that if we divest certain businesses or discontinue certain product lines that we will be able to replace the sales and profits related to these businesses or appropriately utilize our remaining resources  which may result in a decline in our operating results and or result in an inappropriate capitalization of our organization

item properties we lease and own space for our retail stores  distribution centers  manufacturing facilities and sales administration office space in various domestic and international locations 
we believe that our existing properties are well maintained  are in good operating condition and will be adequate for our present level of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into lease agreements for retail space 
most of the leases require us to pay specified minimum rent  as well as real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses applicable to the property  plus a contingent rent based on a percentage of the store s net sales in excess of a specific threshold 
the leases have varying terms and expirations and frequently have provisions to extend  renew or terminate the lease agreement  among other terms and conditions  as negotiated 
assets leased under operating leases are not recognized as assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
periodically  we assess the operating results of each of our retail stores and restaurants to assess whether the location provides  or is expected to provide  an appropriate long term return on investment  whether the location remains brand appropriate and other factors 
as a result of this assessment  we may determine that it is appropriate to close certain stores that do not continue to meet our investment criteria  not renew certain leases  exercise an early termination option  or otherwise negotiate an early termination 
for existing leases in desirable locations  we anticipate that we will be able to extend our retail leases  to the extent that they expire in the near future  on terms that are satisfactory to us  or if necessary  locate substitute properties on acceptable terms 
we also believe that there are adequate retail spaces available for the continued expansion of our retail store footprint in the future 
as of january   our retail operations utilized approximately million square feet of leased retail and restaurant space in the united states  the united kingdom and europe 
each of our retail stores and restaurants is less than  square feet  and we do not believe that we are dependent upon any individual retail store or restaurant location for our business operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow primarily through our design  sourcing  marketing and distribution of branded apparel products bearing the trademarks of our owned lifestyle brands as well as certain licensed and private label apparel products 
we distribute our products through our direct to consumer channels  including our retail stores  e commerce websites and restaurants  and our wholesale distribution channel  which includes better department stores  specialty stores  national chains  specialty catalogs  mass merchants and internet retailers 
in fiscal  more than of our consolidated net sales were to customers located in the united states  with the remainder primarily being sales of our ben sherman products in the united kingdom and europe 
we source substantially all of our products through third party manufacturers located outside of the united states and united kingdom 
we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous us based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms  dominate the apparel industry and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
we believe our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is related to our ability to foresee changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference  and to present appealing products for consumers 
in some instances  a retailer that is our customer may compete directly with us by offering certain of their own competing products  some of which may be sourced directly by our customer  in their own retail stores 
additionally  the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the conditions have on other industries 
the global economic conditions and resulting economic uncertainty that began in fiscal continues to impact each of our operating groups  and the apparel industry as a whole 
although declines in consumer spending in the us have moderated and our product sales have generally increased during fiscal and fiscal  unemployment levels remain high  the retail environment remains highly promotional and a significant amount of economic uncertainty remains 
while we anticipate sales of our products may continue to be negatively impacted as long as there is an elevated level of economic uncertainty  we believe that our operating groups have significant opportunities for long term growth 
we believe that each of our lifestyle brands has opportunities for growth in its direct to consumer businesses through expansion of our retail store footprint as well as increases in same store sales 
we also believe that our lifestyle brands provide an opportunity for moderate sales increases in our wholesale businesses primarily from our current customers adding to their existing door count and the selective addition of new wholesale customers 
although the challenging economic conditions continue to have an impact on our business and the apparel industry as a whole  and we continue to focus on minimizing inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  we were slightly more aggressive in our inventory purchases for fiscal and anticipate continuing to purchase inventory more aggressively in fiscal if the economic conditions continue to show improvement 
the second half of fiscal was impacted by pricing pressures on raw materials  fuel  transportation  labor and other costs necessary for the production and sourcing of apparel products  particularly in our ben sherman and lanier clothes operating groups 
we anticipate that these increased product costs will continue to impact our operating results through the first half of fiscal  but may moderate in the second half of fiscal 
table of contents we continue to believe it is important to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity  and we believe that our strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with positive cash flow from operations will provide us ample resources to fund future investments in our lifestyle brands 
further  we believe that we have a significant opportunity beginning on july  to improve our capital structure  when we can redeem our senior secured notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  which redemption price will decrease in subsequent years  which could result in substantial interest savings for us after that date if we can replace these notes with more attractive borrowing alternatives 
in the future  we may add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio  if we identify appropriate lifestyle brands which meet our investment criteria  however  we believe that we have significant opportunities to appropriately deploy our capital and resources in our existing lifestyle brands even absent any future acquisition 
the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results in thousands  except per share amounts for fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal fiscal net sales operating income earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share earnings from discontinued operations  net of taxes earnings from discontinued operations  net of taxes  per diluted common share net earnings net earnings per diluted common share the primary reasons for the improvement in earnings from continuing operations were an increase in net sales and operating income primarily driven by the million of net sales related to lilly pulitzer  which we acquired on december  and was not included in our results of operations for a full year in fiscal  and a sales increase in the direct to consumer channel of distribution at tommy bahama 
improved gross margins resulting from a change in sales mix attributable to the inclusion of the lilly pulitzer operations for a full year in fiscal and the higher proportion of direct to consumer sales in tommy bahama in fiscal these items were partially offset by the negative impact on our gross profit of the net impact of lifo accounting charges which were million in fiscal and million in fiscal and gross margin declines in ben sherman and lanier clothes in fiscal increased royalty income primarily due to the royalty income associated with the lilly pulitzer business  as well as increased royalty income in ben sherman and tommy bahama 
lower interest expense in fiscal due to our reduction of debt as a result of our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes in fiscal  as described in more detail below in senior secured notes 
these items were partially offset by the million loss on repurchase of senior secured notes during fiscal resulting from our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes 
the increase in sg a  which was primarily due to the inclusion of million of sg a associated with the lilly pulitzer operations during fiscal  the incremental sg a associated with the costs of operating tommy bahama retail stores which opened during fiscal and fiscal  certain infrastructure and other costs related to the tommy bahama 
table of contents international expansion and the net impact of certain retail store asset impairments offset by any associated write offs of deferred rent credits associated with retail stores that were closed or anticipated to be closed 
these increases were partially offset by the death benefit gain of a corporate owned life insurance policy of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  sg a was impacted by million of restructuring charges in ben sherman  million of transaction costs associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition and a million reduction of an environmental reserve liability 
a million charge during fiscal  compared to a million charge in fiscal  related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration associated with the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations 
earnings from discontinued operations reflect the operations related to substantially all of our former oxford apparel operating group  which we sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal the operating results of the discontinued operations reflect substantially all of the normal operating activities of our former oxford apparel operating group in the first eleven months of fiscal as well as the gain on sale in fiscal however the fiscal earnings from discontinued operations reflect certain wind down and transition activities and an adjustment to the gain on sale upon finalization of the working capital adjustment in fiscal we do not anticipate significant operating income loss or cash flows associated with discontinued operations subsequent to fiscal senior secured notes in fiscal  we repurchased  in privately negotiated transactions  million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes for million  plus accrued interest  using cash on hand 
the repurchase of the senior secured notes and related write off of approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs and discount resulted in a loss on repurchase of senior notes of approximately million in fiscal after completion of the transactions  million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes remained outstanding as of january  beginning july   we are permitted to redeem the senior secured notes  at our option on not less than nor more than days prior notice at of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  which redemption price will decrease in subsequent years

net sales fiscal fiscal change change tommy bahama lilly pulitzer    nm ben sherman lanier clothes corporate and other total net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the net sales related to the lilly pulitzer business and the increase in net sales at tommy bahama  each as discussed below 
tommy bahama the increase in net sales for tommy bahama was primarily driven by increased direct to consumer sales resulting from a low double digit increase in comparable full price retail store sales and sales at retail stores opened during fiscal and fiscal as well as an e commerce sales increase exceeding 
wholesale and restaurant sales also increased modestly during fiscal tommy 
table of contents bahama unit sales increased due to the higher volume in each distribution channel  and the average selling price per unit increased  primarily as a result of the higher proportion of net sales from the direct to consumer channel of distribution and higher product sales prices generally as certain product cost increases were recovered from consumers 
as of january   tommy bahama operated retail stores compared to retail stores as of january  lilly pulitzer we acquired the lilly pulitzer brand and operations on december  therefore  our consolidated operating results for the first months of fiscal did not include any operating activities for lilly pulitzer 
net sales for lilly pulitzer for fiscal were million 
by way of comparison  the lilly pulitzer brand and operations generated million of net sales during fiscal  of which only million was included in our consolidated operating results 
the million of net sales in fiscal reflects significant increases in each of the wholesale  retail and e commerce channels of distribution 
ben sherman net sales for ben sherman in fiscal increased by approximately from fiscal the net sales for fiscal reflect an increase in the average selling price per unit of  which was partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of 
the increase in average selling price per unit was due to our strategy to improve the wholesale distribution of the brand  a greater proportion of ben sherman s total sales being retail sales  which generally have higher selling prices  during fiscal  the favorable foreign currency translation impact of a change in average exchange rates between the two periods and the million of net sales associated with the previously exited women s and footwear businesses  much of which was sold at close out prices in fiscal with no such sales in fiscal the reduced unit volume was primarily the result of our continuing strategy to improve the wholesale distribution of the brand  as reduced unit sales to certain moderate department stores have not yet been replaced with sales to targeted upper tier retailers  as well as the lack of close out sales associated with our previously exited women s and footwear businesses in fiscal lanier clothes the increase in net sales for lanier clothes was primarily due to increased net sales in branded tailored clothing products 
the average selling price per unit increased as a result of the change in sales mix as our branded tailored clothing products  which typically have a higher average selling price than our private label products  represented a greater percentage of net sales for lanier clothes in fiscal a decrease in unit sales of was primarily driven by the decreased sales in the private label businesses  which was partially offset by an increase in unit sales of branded tailored clothing products 
corporate and other corporate and other net sales primarily consisted of the net sales of our oxford golf business and our lyons  georgia distribution center 
the increase in the net sales for corporate and other was primarily driven by the higher net sales in our oxford golf business during fiscal 
table of contents gross profit fiscal fiscal change change gross profit gross margin gross profit as a of net sales lifo charges included in gross profit charge related to write up of acquired inventory included in gross profit the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher net sales  as discussed above 
the increase in gross margins was primarily due to changes in the sales mix in fiscal compared to fiscal the changes in sales mix included the inclusion of lilly pulitzer operating results for a full year in fiscal  and direct to consumer sales  which generally have higher gross margins than wholesale sales  making up a larger proportion of tommy bahama sales 
these items  which positively impacted gross margins  were partially offset by the negative impact on our gross profit of the net impact of lifo accounting  which included million of charges in fiscal compared to million of charges in fiscal  and gross margin declines in ben sherman and lanier clothes in fiscal the million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  of charges to cost of goods sold in lilly pulitzer resulted from the write up of acquired inventory to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of acquired inventory 
we do not anticipate there will be any such charges to cost of goods sold in lilly pulitzer in future years

these increases were partially offset by the death benefit of a corporate owned life insurance policy of approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  sg a was impacted by million of restructuring charges in ben sherman  million of transaction costs associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition and a million reduction of an environmental reserve liability 
sg a as a percentage of net sales benefitted from leveraging  as our net sales increased at a greater rate than the increase in sg a  as certain sg a costs do not fluctuate with sales levels 
amortization of intangible assets  which is included in sg a and totaled approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets for tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman 
we anticipate that amortization of intangible assets for fiscal will be approximately million 

table of contents change in fair value of contingent consideration fiscal fiscal change change change in fair value of contingent consideration   nm in connection with the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the sellers  whereby we will be obligated to pay certain contingent consideration amounts based on the achievement of certain performance criteria by our lilly pulitzer operating group  which may be as much as million in the aggregate over the four years subsequent to the acquisition 
in accordance with us gaap  we have recognized a liability in our consolidated balance sheets for the fair value of this liability 
this liability increases in fair value as we approach the date of anticipated payment  resulting in a charge to our consolidated statements of earnings during that period 
thus  the amounts reflected in our statements of earnings reflect the change in fair value of the contingent consideration obligations 
prior to the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we did not have any contingent consideration arrangements requiring adjustment to fair value 
the increase in change in fair value of contingent consideration was due to fiscal including a full year  whereas  fiscal only included a six week period 
we anticipate that the change in contingent consideration for fiscal will be approximately million  however  that amount could change significantly depending upon whether there are any changes to our assumptions about the probability of payment of the contingent consideration  appropriate discount rate or other factors 
royalties and other operating income fiscal fiscal change change royalties and other operating income the increase in royalties and other operating income was primarily due to the royalty income associated with the recently acquired lilly pulitzer business as well as increased royalty income in ben sherman and tommy bahama

the fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by approximately million of charges in the first quarter to cost of goods sold resulting from the write up of acquired inventory to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of acquired inventory 
us gaap requires that all assets acquired as part of an acquisition  including inventory  be recorded at fair value  rather than its original cost 
this write up was recognized as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business 
we do not anticipate that there will be any such charges to cost of goods sold in future periods

the lower sg a in fiscal was primarily due to fiscal including million of restructuring charges 
lanier clothes fiscal fiscal change change net sales operating income operating income as of net sales the decrease in operating income for lanier clothes  despite higher sales levels  was primarily the result of gross margin pressures and increased sg a  including higher royalty and advertising expenses as a result of the higher branded sales  during fiscal corporate and other fiscal fiscal change change net sales operating loss lifo charges included in operating loss life insurance death benefit gain included in operating loss acquisition transaction costs included in operating loss environmental reserve reduction included in operating loss the corporate and other operating results improved by million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal the improved operating results for fiscal were primarily due to lower employee compensation costs  transition services fee income related to our former oxford apparel operating group  which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the death benefit from a corporate owned life insurance policy

income taxes fiscal fiscal change change income taxes effective tax rate income tax expense for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher earnings in fiscal as well as an increase in the effective tax rate 
income taxes for both periods were impacted by certain discrete items  including a decrease in income tax contingency reserves upon the expiration of the corresponding statute of limitations  favorable permanent differences and tax credits which do not necessarily fluctuate with earnings  and net changes in the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to changes in enacted tax rates 
the impact of these discrete items on the effective tax rate was much more significant in fiscal due to the lower earnings level in fiscal and their magnitude 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate  before the impact of any discrete items  for future periods will be higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal or fiscal if our earnings levels increase as the incremental earnings will be taxed at rates more closely aligned with statutory tax rates

tommy bahama apparel unit sales increased  which was a result of the improvement in all channels of distribution

these increased charges to sg a were partially offset by the million of decrease in sg a in fiscal resulting from a reduction in our estimate of expected remediation costs associated with an existing environmental reserve 
change in fair value of contingent consideration fiscal fiscal change change change in fair value of contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the sellers  whereby we will be obligated to pay certain contingent consideration amounts based on the achievement of certain performance criteria by our lilly pulitzer operating group  which may be as much as million in the aggregate over the four years subsequent to the acquisition 
in accordance with us gaap  we have recognized a liability in our consolidated balance sheets for the fair value of this liability 
this liability increases in fair value as we approach the date of anticipated payment  resulting in a charge to our consolidated statements of earnings 
additionally  the fair value of the contingent consideration may change in future periods to the extent that our assumptions regarding the probability of the payment of the contingent consideration  discount rates and other factors change as part of our periodic assessment of the fair value of the liability 

table of contents royalties and other operating income fiscal fiscal change change royalties and other operating income the increase in royalties and other operating income was primarily due to increased royalty income in tommy bahama  as sales reported by certain licensees increased and new licensees were added as well as the impact of a payment received related to the termination of the license for tommy bahama rum in fiscal operating income loss fiscal fiscal change change tommy bahama lilly pulitzer nm ben sherman lanier clothes corporate and other total operating income lifo charges included in operating income charge related to write up of acquired inventory included in operating income charge for increase in fair value of contingent consideration included in operating income acquisition transaction costs included in operating income restructuring charges included in operating income environmental reserve reduction included in operating income operating income  on a consolidated basis  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the million increase in operating income was primarily due to increased net sales  improved gross margins and higher royalty income  which were partially offset by increased sg a  the impact of restructuring charges of million for fiscal and million for fiscal  inventory mark up charges associated with purchase accounting of million and transaction costs associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition of million 
additionally  operating income included charges for lifo accounting of million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal also included a million of decrease in sg a resulting from a reduction in our estimate of remediation costs associated with an existing environmental reserve 
changes in operating income by operating group are discussed below 
tommy bahama fiscal fiscal change change net sales operating income operating income as of net sales restructuring charges included in operating income the increase in operating income for tommy bahama was primarily due to the increased net sales  improved gross margins due to a greater proportion of direct to consumer sales as a percentage of total tommy bahama sales and higher royalty income  which were partially offset by increased sg a 
table of contents associated with higher incentive compensation expense  the costs of operating additional retail stores during fiscal and other overhead cost increases 
lilly pulitzer fiscal fiscal net sales operating income loss operating income loss as of net sales charge related to write up of acquired inventory included in operating income loss charge for increase in fair value of contingent consideration included in operating income loss we acquired lilly pulitzer on december  therefore  fiscal reflects approximately six weeks of operating income for lilly pulitzer while the prior year includes no operating income for lilly pulitzer 
the six weeks of fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to cost of goods sold in lilly pulitzer resulting from the write up of acquired inventory from cost to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of acquired inventory 
us gaap requires that all assets acquired as part of an acquisition  including inventory  be recorded at fair value  rather than cost 
this write up was recognized as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business 
additionally  the lilly pulitzer operating results included a million charge related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration 
us gaap requires that we estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration periodically  with any change in the fair value being included in the statement of earnings during that period 
ben sherman fiscal fiscal change change net sales operating income loss operating income loss as of net sales restructuring charges included in operating income loss the improved operating results for ben sherman were primarily due to increased gross margins and reduced sg a  driven by our exit from and subsequent licensing of the footwear and kids businesses  our exit from the women s operations and other streamlining initiatives 
fiscal included million of charges associated with our termination of two retail store leases in the united kingdom and fixed asset impairment charges  while sg a included million of restructuring charges primarily related to our exit from and subsequent licensing of the footwear and kids businesses and other streamlining initiatives 
lanier clothes fiscal fiscal change change net sales operating income operating income as of net sales 
table of contents the increase in operating income for lanier clothes was primarily a result of improved gross margins due to sales mix  with branded sales representing a greater proportion of lanier clothes sales in fiscal  and close out sales associated with exited businesses being included in net sales fiscal the improved gross margins were partially offset by increased sg a  resulting from higher incentive compensation expense and the higher cost structure generally associated with branded businesses 
corporate and other fiscal fiscal change change net sales operating loss lifo charges included in operating loss acquisition transaction costs included in operating loss environmental reserve reduction included in operating loss the corporate and other operating results improved by million from a loss of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal fiscal and fiscal included lifo accounting charges of million and million  respectively 
fiscal also included million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of lilly pulitzer  which were expensed as incurred  and a million reduction in our estimate of expected remediation costs associated with an existing environmental reserve 
aside from the impact of lifo accounting charges  the transaction costs associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition and the reduction in the environmental reserve  the reduced operating results were primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs resulting from the resumption of our incentive compensation program  which was suspended in fiscal and is tied to our financial performance 
interest expense  net fiscal fiscal change change interest expense  net interest expense for fiscal increased compared to fiscal  after reclassifying all interest related to our us revolving credit agreement to discontinued operations 
the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates in fiscal  which resulted from the june replacement of our senior unsecured notes due with our senior secured notes 
loss on repurchase of senior notes fiscal fiscal change change loss on repurchase of senior secured notes fiscal included a million write off of unamortized deferred financing costs and discount related to our senior unsecured notes due  which were satisfied and discharged in june no loss on repurchase of senior notes was incurred in fiscal income taxes fiscal fiscal change change income taxes    nm effective tax rate nm 
table of contents income taxes for both periods were impacted by certain discrete items  including a decrease in income tax contingency reserves upon the expiration of the corresponding statute of limitations  favorable permanent differences and tax credits which do not necessarily fluctuate with earnings 
net earnings fiscal fiscal change earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share net earnings from discontinued operations net earnings from discontinued operations per diluted common share net earnings net earnings per diluted common share weighted average common shares outstanding diluted the increase in earnings from continuing operations was primarily due to higher net sales with a higher gross margin resulting from a change in sales mix and higher royalty income  but partially offset by higher sg a  each as discussed above 
the increased results of the discontinued operations reflects the million after tax gain on the sale of substantially all the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel operating group  partially offset by the impact of fiscal including months of activity prior to the sale compared with months of activity in fiscal 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary source of revenue and cash flow is our distribution of apparel products through our direct to consumer and wholesale channels of distribution in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the united kingdom 
our primary uses of cash flow include the acquisition of apparel products in the operation of our business  as well as employee compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  funding of capital expenditures for new and remodeled retail stores  marketing and advertising costs  other general and administrative operating expenses  periodic interest payments related to our financing arrangements  payment of our quarterly dividends and repayment of our indebtedness 
if cash inflows are less than cash outflows  we have access to amounts under our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement  subject to their terms  each of which is described below 
we may seek to finance future capital investment programs through various methods  including  but not limited to  cash on hand  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our current or future credit arrangements and sales of debt or equity securities 
although our net sales  operating income and operating cash flows were impacted by the uncertain economic conditions that began in fiscal  we have maintained positive operating cash flows for each fiscal year during these uncertain economic conditions  and we anticipate net sales and operating cash flows will increase as economic conditions continue to improve 
also  we believe we have maintained a strong balance sheet and liquidity through various actions taken in recent years including purchasing inventory at levels which mitigated inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  as appropriate  reducing working capital levels  reducing our corporate overhead costs  exiting certain underperforming businesses in ben sherman and lanier clothes  reducing our capital expenditures related to new store openings during the economic downturn and divesting substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel operating group in january as a result of these actions in the preceding years and positive operating cash flows  we were able to purchase the lilly pulitzer brand and operations on december  for million plus up to million of contingent consideration dependent upon the acquired business meeting certain earnings thresholds  repurchase million in aggregate principal of our senior secured 
table of contents notes for approximately million  plus accrued interest  in fiscal and invest approximately million in capital expenditures in fiscal after all of these events  we had approximately million of cash on hand as of january  with no borrowings outstanding and million of availability under our million us revolving credit agreement 
we believe our balance sheet and anticipated positive cash flows from operating activities in the future provides us with ample opportunity to continue to invest in our brands and our direct to consumer initiatives in future periods and potentially replace our senior secured notes with lower cost borrowings in july key liquidity measures in thousands january  january  change change current assets current liabilities working capital working capital ratio debt to total capital ratio our working capital ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities  including assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations 
both current assets and current liabilities decreased significantly from january  to january   primarily as a result of the conversion of the million of assets related to discontinued operations  as of january   to cash and the payment of the million of liabilities related to discontinued operations  as of january   as well as the impact of our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes for approximately million  plus accrued interest  during fiscal the other changes in our current assets and liabilities are discussed below 
for the ratio of debt to total capital  debt is defined as short term and long term debt  and total capital is defined as debt plus shareholders equity 
debt was million at january  and million at january   while shareholders equity was million at january  and million at january  the change in the debt to total capital ratio from january  to january  was primarily a result of our repurchase of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes in fiscal and earnings from continuing operations during fiscal  which resulted in an increase in shareholders equity during the year 
our debt levels and ratio of debt to total capital in future periods may not be comparable to historical amounts as we continue to assess  and possibly make changes to  our capital structure 
changes in our capital structure in the future  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material

receivables  net as of january  increased compared to january  primarily due to the increased wholesale sales in our operating groups in the last two months of fiscal compared to the last two months of fiscal inventories  net as of january  increased from january  primarily due to an increase to support anticipated sales and growth as well as the timing of spring shipments  which were received earlier in fiscal compared to fiscal  and the increased product cost of inventories at january  the increase in prepaid expenses  net from january  to january  was primarily due to the increase in prepaid taxes and other prepaid expenses 
deferred tax assets have increased from january  primarily as a result of the change in timing differences associated with inventory  partially offset by changes related to accruals for compensation and other liabilities

our credit facilities are also used to finance trade letters of credit for product purchases  which are drawn against our lines of credit at the time of shipment of the products and reduce the amounts available under our lines of credit and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities when issued 
as of january   approximately million of trade letters of credit and other limitations on availability in the aggregate were outstanding against the us revolving credit agreement and the us revolving credit agreement 
after considering these limitations and the amount of eligible assets in our borrowing base  as of january   we had approximately million in unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement and approximately million in unused availability under the uk revolving credit agreement  subject to the respective limitations on borrowings set forth in the us revolving credit agreement  uk revolving credit agreement and the indenture for the senior secured notes 

table of contents covenants  other restrictions and prepayment penalties our credit facilities and senior secured notes are subject to a number of affirmative covenants regarding the delivery of financial information  compliance with law  maintenance of property  insurance and conduct of business 
also  our credit facilities and senior secured notes are subject to certain negative covenants or other restrictions including  among other things  limitations on our ability to i incur debt  ii guaranty certain obligations  iii incur liens  iv pay dividends to shareholders  v repurchase shares of our common stock  vi make investments  vii sell assets or stock of subsidiaries  viii acquire assets or businesses  ix merge or consolidate with other companies  or x prepay  retire  repurchase or redeem debt 
our us revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant that applies if unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement for three consecutive days is less than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments 
in such case  our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the us revolving credit agreement must not be less than to for the immediately preceding fiscal months for which financial statements have been delivered 
this financial covenant continues to apply until we have maintained unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement of more than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments for consecutive days 
additionally  pursuant to the indenture governing our senior secured notes  our ability to incur certain indebtedness or to make certain restricted payments  as defined in the indenture  is subject to our meeting certain conditions  including in each case the condition that our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  not be less than to for the preceding four fiscal quarters on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed indebtedness or restricted payment and  in the case of a restricted payment  the condition that the aggregate total of all restricted payments not exceed a certain allowable amount calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the indenture 
restricted payments under the indenture include  without limitation  cash dividends to shareholders  repurchases of our capital stock  and certain investments 
we believe that the affirmative covenants  negative covenants  financial covenants and other restrictions are customary for those included in similar facilities and notes entered into at the time we entered into our agreements 
during fiscal and as of january   no financial covenant testing was required pursuant to our us revolving credit agreement as the minimum availability threshold was met at all times 
as of january   we were compliant with all covenants related to our credit facilities and senior secured notes 
at any time prior to july   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior secured notes  on not less than nor more than days prior notice  in amounts of  or an integral multiple of  in excess thereof  at a price equal to the greater of i of the aggregate principal amount of the senior secured notes to be redeemed  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption or ii as determined by an independent investment banker as prescribed under the indenture  the sum of the present values of of the principal amount of the senior secured notes being redeemed plus scheduled payments of interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption from the date of redemption to july  discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the adjusted treasury rate as defined in the indenture plus basis points  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
on or after july   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior secured notes  on not less than nor more than days prior notice  in amounts of  or an integral multiple of  in excess thereof at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal 
table of contents amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  if redeemed during the month period beginning july of the years indicated below and thereafter although we have not entered into any arrangements as of the date of this report  we currently intend to seek to redeem on or after july  the senior secured notes outstanding at that time with other borrowings  which may include additional borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement  borrowings under another variable rate revolving credit agreement  a fixed interest rate term loan  senior notes or a combination of these alternatives  as well as cash on hand  if any 
if this change in our capital structure is completed in fiscal  it could significantly increase our exposure to variable interest rates compared to our current exposure 
other liquidity items we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements  which generally consist of working capital and other operating activity needs  capital expenditures  interest payments on our debt during fiscal and dividends  if any  primarily from positive cash flow from operations supplemented by cash on hand and borrowings under our lines of credit  if necessary 
our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing in the fall and spring of each year 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance inventory levels and the success of our various products 
at maturity of the us revolving credit agreement and the senior secured notes or if the uk revolving credit agreement was required to be paid  we anticipate that we will be able to refinance the facilities and debt with terms available in the market at that time  which may or may not be as favorable as the terms of the current agreements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of january   by future period in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands contractual obligations senior secured notes interest on senior secured notes us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement operating leases minimum royalty and advertising payments pursuant to royalty agreements letters of credit contingent purchase price consideration other total the million of senior secured notes reflect our fiscal repurchase of million of our senior secured notes  but do not assume any other redemption or repurchase in or after fiscal principal and interest amounts payable in future periods on our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement have been excluded from the table above  as the amount that will be outstanding and interest rate during any fiscal year will be dependent upon future events which are not known at this time 
as of january   no amounts were outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement and million was outstanding under our uk revolving credit agreement 
amounts to be paid in future periods for real estate taxes  insurance  other operating expenses and contingent rent applicable to the properties pursuant to the respective operating leases have been excluded from the table above  as the amounts payable in future periods are generally not quantified in the lease agreements and are dependent on factors which are not known at this time 
such amounts incurred in fiscal totaled approximately million 
amounts reflected in the table reflect the maximum amount payable pursuant to a contingent consideration arrangement associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition  which totaled million as of january  amounts are payable if certain performance criteria related to the acquired business are met during the four years subsequent to acquisition 
as of january   our balance sheet reflects a liability of million associated with this arrangement  of which million is included in non current contingent consideration in our consolidated balance sheets  which reflects the fair value of the non current anticipated payments as of that date and million is included in contingent consideration earned and payable in our consolidated balance sheets  which is expected to be paid during fiscal as the amounts were earned in fiscal amounts totaling million of deferred compensation obligations and obligations related to the postretirement benefit portions of endorsement type split dollar life insurance policies  which are included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january   have been excluded from the table above  due to the uncertainty of the timing of the payment of 
table of contents these obligations  which are generally at the discretion of the individual employees or upon the death of the individual  respectively 
an environmental reserve liability of million  which is included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  has been excluded from the above table  as we were not contractually obligated to incur these costs as of january  and the timing of payment is uncertain 
non current deferred tax liabilities of million included in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been excluded from the above table  as deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
as the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities by period could be misleading 
our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal  which are excluded from the table above as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts as of january   are expected to be approximately million 
these expenditures are expected to consist primarily of costs associated with opening new retail stores  information technology initiatives  retail store remodeling  and distribution center enhancements 
dividend declaration on march   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share payable on april  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on april  although we have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in july  we may discontinue or modify dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital  including but not limited to  payment of outstanding debt  repurchases of outstanding shares  funding of acquisitions or funding of capital expenditures  may be in our best interest  if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend  or if the terms of our credit facilities  the indenture for the senior secured notes  other debt instruments  contingent consideration arrangements or applicable law limit our ability to pay dividends 
we may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectation of operating cash flows in future periods subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facilities  the indenture for the senior secured notes or other debt instruments and applicable law 
all cash flow from operations will not necessarily be paid out as dividends in all periods 
for details about limitations on our ability to pay dividends  see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in this report and the discussion of our credit facilities and senior secured notes above 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into agreements which meet the sec s definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement  other than operating leases  and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with respect to any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing 
table of contents basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of earnings could be misstated 
the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies  estimates and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue primarily consists of direct to consumer sales  which includes retail store  e commerce  restaurant and concession sales  and wholesale sales 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
retail store  e commerce  restaurant and concession revenues are recognized at the time of sale to consumers as we believe the criteria for revenue recognition are met at the time of sale 
retail store  e commerce  restaurant and concession revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  as appropriate  and net of applicable sales taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as direct to consumer products may be returned in future periods after the date of original purchase by the consumer  we must make estimates of reserves for products which were sold prior to the balance sheet date but that we anticipate may be returned by the consumer subsequent to that date 
the determination of direct to consumer return reserve amounts requires judgment and consideration of historical and current trends  evaluation of current economic trends and other factors 
our historical estimates of direct to consumer return reserves have not differed materially from actual results 
as of january  our direct to consumer return reserve was approximately million 
a change in the direct to consumer return reserve as of january  would have had a million pre tax impact on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts and allowances  as well as advertising support not specifically relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers  operational chargebacks and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis 
significant considerations in determining our estimates for discounts  returns  allowances and operational chargebacks for wholesale customers include historical and current trends  agreements with customers  projected seasonal results  an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance 
actual discounts and allowances to our wholesale customers have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of january   our total reserves for discounts and allowances for our wholesale businesses were approximately million and  therefore  if the allowances changed by it would have had a pre tax impact of million on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal in circumstances where we become aware of a specific wholesale customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to 
table of contents reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other wholesale customers  we recognize estimated reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends  each of which is subjective and requires certain assumptions 
actual charges for uncollectible amounts have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  and therefore  if the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by it would have had a pre tax impact of approximately million on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal inventories  net for operating group reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of the first in  first out fifo method cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
in performing this evaluation we consider slow turning products  prior seasons fashion products and current levels of replenishment program products as compared to future sales estimates 
for direct to consumer inventory  we provide an allowance for goods expected to be sold below cost and shrinkage 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods as necessary 
as the amount to be ultimately realized for the goods is not necessarily known at period end  we must utilize certain assumptions that take into consideration historical experience  the age of the inventory  inventory quantity  quality and mix  historical sales trends  future sales projections  consumer and retailer preferences  market trends and general economic conditions 
for consolidated financial reporting  approximately million of our inventories are valued at the lower of last in  first out lifo method cost or market after deducting the million lifo reserve as of january  the remaining million of our inventories are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market as of january  as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of our inventories were accounted for using the lifo method 
generally  our inventories related to our domestic operations are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market and our inventories related to our international operations are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market 
lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups as lifo inventory pools do not correspond to our operating group definitions 
lifo reserves are based on the producer price index as published by the united states department of labor 
we write down inventories valued at the lower of lifo cost or market when lifo exceeds market value 
we consider lifo accounting adjustments to not only include changes in the lifo reserve  but also changes in markdown reserves which are considered in lifo accounting 
for operating group reporting purposes included in note to our consolidated financial statements and in the results of operations in our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report  the impact of lifo accounting is included in corporate and other 
as of january   we had recorded a reserve of approximately million related to inventory on the lower of fifo cost or market method and for inventory on the lower of lifo cost or market method with markdowns in excess of our lifo reserve 
a change in the amount of markdowns for inventory valued on the lower of fifo cost or market method and markdowns in excess of the lifo reserve as of january  would have a pre tax impact of approximately million on earnings from continuing operations in fiscal a change in the markdowns of our inventory valued at the lower of lifo cost or market method typically would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements after consideration of the existence of our significant lifo reserve of million  or of the fifo cost of the inventory  as of january   as well as the high gross margins historically achieved for the sale of our lifestyle branded products 
a change in inventory levels at the end of future fiscal years compared to inventory balances as of january  could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as 
table of contents such a change may erode portions of our earlier base year layers for purposes of making our annual lifo computation 
additionally  a change in the producer price index as published by the united states department of labor as compared to the indexes as of january  could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as inflation or deflation would change the amount of our lifo reserve 
given the significant amount of uncertainties surrounding the year end lifo calculation  including the estimate of year end inventory balances and year end producer price indexes  we typically do not adjust our lifo reserve in the first three quarters of a fiscal year 
this policy may result in significant lifo accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year resulting from the year over year changes in inventory levels  the producer price index and markdown reserves 
we do recognize on a quarterly basis during the first three quarters of the fiscal year changes in markdown reserves as those amounts can be estimated on a quarterly basis 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires that assets and liabilities  including inventories  are recorded at fair value at acquisition 
in accordance with us gaap  the definition of fair value of inventories acquired generally will equal the expected sales price less certain costs associated with selling the inventory  which may exceed the actual cost of producing the acquired inventories 
in accordance with us gaap  in connection with our december acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we recognized a write up of inventories of approximately million above the cost of acquired inventories to fair value  which we included in our allocation of purchase price 
based on the inventory turn of the acquired inventories  approximately million of the write up was recognized as additional cost of goods sold in fiscal  and the remaining million of the write up  which was included in inventories  net in our consolidated balance sheet as of january   was recognized as cost of goods sold during fiscal as the acquired inventory was sold in the ordinary course of business 
in determining the fair value of the acquired inventory  as well as the appropriate period to recognize the charge in our consolidated statements of earnings as the acquired inventory is sold  we must make certain assumptions regarding costs incurred prior to acquisition for the acquired inventory  an appropriate profit allowance  estimates of the costs to sell the inventory and the timing of the sale of the acquired inventory 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and if we had made different assumptions  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be significant 
intangible assets  net intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  totaled approximately million  which includes approximately million of customer relationships with finite lives and million of trademarks with indefinite lives 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and customer relationships 
the fair values and useful lives of these intangible assets are estimated based on management s assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
such valuation may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk adjusted market based cost of capital as the discount rate 
the valuation of intangible assets requires significant judgment due to the variety of uncertain factors  including planned use of the intangible assets as well as estimates of future net sales  growth rates  royalty rates for the trademarks and discount rates 
the use of different assumptions related to these uncertain factors at acquisition could result in a material change to the amounts of intangible assets initially recorded at acquisition  which could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of our december acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we recognized million of intangible assets including trademarks and customer relationships in our consolidated balance sheet at acquisition using the methodology outlined above 
these acquired 
table of contents intangible assets consist of million of indefinite lived trademarks and million of definite lived customer relationships 
trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the relief from royalty method  among other considerations 
this approach is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors  including those used in the initial valuation of the intangible assets listed above 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and if our plans or anticipated results change  the impact on our financial statements could be significant 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of a trademark with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which primarily consist of customer relationships  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to years 
the determination of an appropriate useful life for amortization is based on our plans for the intangible asset as well as factors outside of our control 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
amortization related to intangible assets with finite lives totaled million during fiscal and is anticipated to be approximately million in fiscal in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  no impairment charges related to intangible assets were recognized 
additionally  we do not believe that a change in any of the assumptions utilized in testing our intangible assets for impairment would have resulted in an impairment charge during any of those periods 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
thus  the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination is dependent upon the fair values assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
as a result of our december acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we allocated approximately million of goodwill to the lilly pulitzer business 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
in september  the fasb issued an update to their accounting guidance regarding goodwill impairment testing 
this update  which we adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal and resulted in no material impact on our consolidated financial statements  allows us to assess qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment and whether it is necessary to perform the two step evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill 
the qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment include a macroeconomic conditions  b industry and market considerations  c cost factors  d overall financial performance  e other relevant entity specific events  f events affecting a reporting unit  g a sustained decrease in share price  or h other factors as appropriate 
as performed in prior years and as may be determined necessary in future periods  the two step evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill includes valuations of each applicable underlying business 
table of contents using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
significant estimates  some of which require subjective judgment  included in such a valuation include future cash flow projections of the business  which are based on our future expectations for the business 
additionally  the discount rate used in this analysis is an estimate of the risk adjusted market based cost of capital 
the estimates and assumptions included in the two step evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill involve significant uncertainty  and if our plans or anticipated results change  the impact on our financial statements could be significant 
we test  either qualitatively or as a two step evaluation  goodwill for impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  which coincides with the timing of our annual budgeting process that is used in estimating future cash flows for the assessment 
in addition to the annual impairment test  if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment between the annual tests  we would perform an impairment test at that time 
in performing this interim assessment  we consider the factors and circumstances used in performing the qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
if an annual or interim analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
no impairment of goodwill was recognized during fiscal  fiscal or fiscal additionally  we do not believe that a change in any of the assumptions utilized in testing our goodwill for impairment would have resulted in an impairment charge during any of those periods 
income taxes income taxes included in our consolidated financial statements are determined using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes are recognized based on amounts of income taxes payable or refundable in the current year as well as the impact of any items that are recognized in different periods for consolidated financial statement and tax return reporting purposes 
as certain amounts are recognized in different periods for consolidated financial statement and tax return purposes  financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities differ  resulting in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the estimated future tax effects attributable to these differences  as well as the impact of net operating loss  capital loss and federal and state credit carryforwards  each as determined under enacted tax laws and rates expected to apply in the period in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled 
as realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities are dependent upon future taxable jurisdictions  changes in tax laws and rates and shifts in the amount of taxable income among state and foreign jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the amount of benefit ultimately realized for deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we account for the effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment 
there are certain exceptions to the requirement that deferred tax liabilities be recognized for the difference in the financial and tax bases of assets in the case of foreign subsidiaries 
the excess of financial statement over tax basis of an investment in a foreign subsidiary in excess of undistributed earnings is not recognized if management considers the investment to be essentially permanent in duration 
we consider our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
for each of these entities  the tax basis equals or exceeds the financial basis as of january  also  deferred tax liabilities are not required to be recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries when management considers those earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states 
the company does not consider the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested outside the us  and therefore records the deferred tax liability on such earnings in the year they are included in the financial statements 

table of contents valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not greater than that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur  or circumstances change  that would indicate adjustments to the valuation allowances are appropriate 
we utilize a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
under the two step method  recognition occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based solely on technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement is only addressed if step one has been satisfied 
the tax benefit recorded is measured as the largest amount of benefit determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first subsequent interim period they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions are recorded within income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as a global company  we are subject to income taxes in a number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
therefore  our income tax provision involves many uncertainties due to not only to the timing differences of income for financial statement and tax return reporting  but also the application of complex tax laws and regulations  which are subject to interpretation and management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or a change in our assumptions related to book to tax timing differences  our determination of whether foreign investments or earnings are permanently reinvested  the realizability of uncertain tax positions  the appropriateness of valuation allowances or other considerations  and the jurisdictions or significance of earnings in future periods each could have a significant impact on our income tax rate 
additionally  factors impacting income taxes that are outside of our control including changes in tax laws or interpretations  court case decisions  statute of limitation expirations or audit settlements could also have a significant impact on our income tax rate 
an increase in our consolidated income tax rate from to during fiscal would have reduced earnings from continuing operations by approximately million 
income tax expense recorded during interim periods is based on the expected tax rate for the year  considering projections of earnings and book to tax differences  which are updated and refined throughout the year 
the tax rate ultimately realized for the year may increase or decrease due to actual operating results or book to tax differences varying from our expectations from earlier in the year 
any changes in assumptions related to the need for a valuation allowance  the realizability of an uncertain tax position  changes in enacted tax rates  the expected operating results for the year  the jurisdictions generating operating income or loss  or other assumptions are accounted for in the period in which the change occurs so that the year to date tax provision reflects the expected annual rate 
fair value measurements for many assets and liabilities the determination of fair value may not require the use of many assumptions or other estimates 
however  in some cases the assumptions or inputs associated with the determination of fair value as of a measurement date may require the use of many assumptions and may be internally derived or otherwise unobservable 
we utilize certain market based and internally derived information and make assumptions about the information in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination  as well as in other circumstances  adjusting previously recorded assets and liabilities to fair value at each balance sheet date  including the fair value of contingent consideration  and assessing recognized assets for impairment  including intangible assets  goodwill and property and equipment 

table of contents as part of our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement whereby we may be obligated to pay up to million if certain performance criteria are met in the four year period subsequent to the december acquisition 
pursuant to the guidance related to the purchase method of accounting  we recognized the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the date of the acquisition 
as of the date of acquisition  we determined that the fair value of the contingent consideration was million  which reflected the discounted fair value of the expected payments 
such valuation requires assumptions regarding anticipated cash flows  probabilities of cash flows  discount rates and other factors  which each involve a significant amount of uncertainty 
although there was uncertainty about whether the performance criteria in the contingent consideration arrangement will be achieved  we anticipated paying the full million of contingent consideration 
thus  the fair value of the contingent consideration at acquisition reflected the million of anticipated payments discounted to fair value 
subsequent to the date of acquisition  we must periodically adjust the liability for the contingent consideration to reflect the fair value of the contingent consideration by reassessing our valuation assumptions as of that date 
as of january   we still anticipate that the performance criteria will be met based on the operating results of the lilly pulitzer business exceeding the performance criteria in fiscal additionally  we evaluated the discount rate as of january  as of january   we determined that the fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately million  with million of the million of contingent consideration being classified as a current liability in contingent consideration earned and payable in our consolidated balance sheet as the million was earned in fiscal and is expected to be paid in the first half of fiscal the remaining million of the contingent consideration is included in non current contingent consideration in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  if the discount rate used in the valuation of the contingent consideration as of january  was decreased by basis points  the fair value of the contingent consideration as of january  would have increased to million from million with the difference in value being reflected as an increase in operating income in our consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal the fair value of the contingent consideration liability is expected to increase each period with the recognition of change in fair value of contingent consideration resulting from the passage of time at the applicable discount rate as we approach the payment dates of the contingent consideration absent any significant changes in assumptions related to the valuation or the probability of payment of the contingent consideration earned during the prior year 
during fiscal  we recognized change in fair value of contingent consideration of million in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the amounts recognized in fiscal primarily reflect the passage of time rather than significant changes in our assumptions during fiscal we estimate that the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to the passage of time in fiscal will be approximately million  however the total change in fair value of contingent consideration expense recognized in fiscal could be significantly different if we change certain of our assumptions related to the contingent consideration during fiscal the change in fair value of contingent consideration in fiscal and fiscal could be significantly different than the amounts recognized in fiscal or currently anticipated for fiscal we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
the cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on their estimated fair values 
the assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets  anticipated cash flows  probabilities of cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
to the extent information to revise the allocation becomes available during the allocation period  the allocation of the purchase price will be adjusted 
should information become available after the allocation period indicating that adjustments to the allocation are 
table of contents appropriate  those adjustments will be included in operating results 
the allocation period will not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
for the determination of fair value for assets and liabilities acquired as part of a business combination  adjusting previously recorded assets and liabilities to fair value at each balance sheet date and assessing  and possibly adjusting  recognized assets for impairment  the assumptions that we make regarding the valuation of these assets could differ significantly from the assumptions made by other parties 
the use of different assumptions could result in materially different valuations for the respective assets and liabilities  which would impact our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued certain changes to accounting pronouncements which may impact our financial statements in future periods upon adoption 
for details on these accounting pronouncements  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
seasonality our operating groups are impacted by seasonality 
for details of the impact of seasonality on our operating groups and consolidated operating results  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
our objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
although we have not historically entered into such contracts  we may also enter into interest rate swap arrangements related to certain of our variable rate debt in order to fix the interest rate on variable rate debt if we determine that our exposure to interest rate changes is higher than optimal 
our assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
none of our debt was entered into for speculative purposes 
also  although we are not precluded from doing so  we have not historically engaged in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk  but we may consider such alternatives in the future 
we do not enter into interest rate hedging transactions on a speculative basis 
as of january   we had million of debt outstanding which was subject to variable interest rates 
our lines of credit  which include our us revolving credit agreement and our us revolving credit agreement  accrue interest based on variable interest rates  while providing the necessary borrowing flexibility we require due to the seasonality of our business and our need to fund certain product purchases with trade letters of credit 
during fiscal  the average debt outstanding under our credit agreements was approximately million  we therefore did not incur a substantial amount of interest expense related to our variable rate debt in fiscal and a basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our fiscal operating results 
we do not believe that borrowings and interest rates  and therefore interest expense  for fiscal are necessarily indicative of borrowings in future periods 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change  our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change 
we do not anticipate the need to have a significant amount of borrowings outstanding under our variable rate lines of credits to fund our 
table of contents ongoing operations during fiscal  however  we may have amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credits at certain times during fiscal based on our seasonal working capital requirements or if anticipated cash requirements exceed our current expectations 
additionally  if we repurchase all or a portion of our senior secured notes outstanding in the future with borrowings under our variable rate lines of credit  make other changes to our capital structure or acquire additional businesses in the future  such transactions could significantly increase our borrowing levels under variable rate lines of credit 
thus  interest expense as well as our exposure to changes in variable interest rates would increase materially if borrowings under our variable rate lines of credit increase in future periods 
as of january   we had million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding  consisting of our senior secured notes  which have an effective interest rate of and mature in july such fixed rate debt may result in higher interest expense than could be obtained under variable interest rate arrangements in certain periods  including fiscal  but is primarily intended to provide long term financing of our capital structure and minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
a change in the market interest rate impacts the fair value of our fixed rate debt but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
our ability to reduce the amount of our senior secured notes outstanding without a significant premium may be limited under the terms of the indenture governing our senior secured notes 
foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
we receive united states dollars for most of our product sales 
however  approximately of our net sales in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
these sales primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of earnings in future periods  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
based on our net sales during fiscal denominated in foreign currencies  if the united states dollar had been stronger against the british pound we would have experienced a decrease in consolidated net sales of approximately million  but we believe the impact on operating income would not have been material 
substantially all of our inventory purchases  including goods for operations in the united kingdom  from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future even though our inventory is purchased on a united states dollar arrangement 
additionally  to the extent that the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the currency that the inventory will be sold in eg the british pound changes  the gross margins of those businesses could be impacted significantly 
we may from time to time purchase short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of january   we were a party to approximately million of such contracts that were unsettled  which had an unrealized fair value of approximately million 
these contracts primarily consist of million of agreements to purchase us dollars with british pound sterling and million of agreements to sell euro for british pound sterling 
during fiscal  foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding did not exceed million at any time 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in other comprehensive income or our consolidated statement of earnings if the transaction does or does not  respectively  qualify as a hedge in accordance with us gaap 

table of contents we anticipate that as we expand tommy bahama into international markets in the future  our exposure to foreign currency changes will increase 
we also anticipate that we will have exposure to foreign currency changes for currencies that we currently do not have any exposure to  including various currencies in asia 
initially  that exposure will be a result of the net investment in those currencies as we expand international operations 
the extent of our exposure will be dependent upon the timing of when and to what magnitude we expand into international markets 
therefore  we do not believe it is possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the potential impact of our future exposure to foreign currencies related to our tommy bahama international operations at this time 
we view our foreign investments as long term and  as a result  we generally do not hedge such foreign investments 
also  we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exposure for speculative purposes 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each operating group through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts  and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such commodity risk 
based on purchases and negotiations for inventory purchases thus far in fiscal  it appears that certain of the product costing pressures  including the price of cotton  that were experienced during the second half of fiscal have eased as we purchase products for the second half of fiscal however  it appears that certain other product costing pressures  including transportation and labor  may not decline much  if at all  from the cost levels of fiscal
