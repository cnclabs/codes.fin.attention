item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company develops  markets and supports service management software solutions  which are licensed to companies that sell and service equipment  or sell and deliver professional services 
the company s principal product offerings  astea alliance and fieldcentrix enterprise suites  integrate and automate sales and service business processes and are designed to assist its users to increase competitive advantages  top line revenue growth and profitability through better management of information  people  assets and cash flows 
we believe that astea alliance offers substantially broader and far superior capabilities over the company s predecessor product  dispatch  which was designed for only field service and customer support management applications 
the company s products and services are primarily used in industries such as information technology  medical devices and diagnostic systems  industrial controls and instrumentation  retail systems  office automation  imaging systems  facilities management and telecommunications 
an eclectic group of other industries  all with equipment sales and service requirements  are also represented in astea s customer base 
the company maintains offices in the united states  united kingdom  australia  israel  japan and the netherlands 
the company generates revenues from two sources software license fees for its software products  and services and maintenance revenues from professional services  which includes consulting  implementation  training and maintenance related to those products 
software license fees accounted for of the company s total revenues in  which was divided between sales of astea alliance at and fieldcentrix at 
software license fee revenues also include some fees from the sublicensing of third party software  primarily knowledge management  mapping and analytical software licenses 
typically  customers pay a license fee for the software based on the number of licensed users 
depending on the contract terms and conditions  software license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the product if no significant vendor obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable 
if significant vendor obligations exist at the time of delivery or if the product is subject to uncertain customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until no significant obligations remain or acceptance has occurred 
the remaining component of the company s revenues consists principally of fees derived from professional services associated with the implementation and deployment of the company s software products  and maintenance fees for ongoing customer support  primarily external customer technical support services and product enhancements 
professional services including training are generally charged on an hourly or daily basis and billed on a regular basis pursuant to customer work orders 
training services may also be charged on a per attendee basis with a minimum daily charge 
out of pocket expenses incurred by company personnel performing professional services are typically reimbursed by the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from professional services as the services are performed unless the services are under a fixed price arrangement 
consulting  training and other services that are sold under fixed price arrangements are recognized using the proportional performance method based on direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated direct labor hours required to complete the project 
consulting services primarily comprise implementation support related to the installation and configuration of the company s products and do not typically require significant production  modification or customization of the software 
in arrangements that require significant production  modification or customization of the software and where services are not available from third party suppliers  the consulting and license fees are recognized concurrently 
when total cost estimates exceed revenue in a fixed price arrangement  the estimated losses are recognized immediately in cost of revenue 
maintenance fees are typically paid to the company under written agreements entered into at the time of the initial software license 
maintenance revenue  which is generally invoiced annually  is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in its summary of accounting policies  note  to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below  however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgments and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition astea s revenue is principally recognized from two sources i licensing arrangements and ii services and maintenance 
the company markets its products primarily through its direct sales force and resellers 
license agreements do not provide for a right of return  and historically  product returns have not been significant 
the company recognizes revenue from license sales when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the fee is probable 
we utilize written contracts as a means to establish the terms and conditions by which our products support and services are sold to our customers 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  which generally occurs after a license key has been delivered electronically to the customer 
revenue for arrangements with extended payment terms in excess of one year is recognized when the payments become due  provided all other recognition criteria are satisfied 
if collectability is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
our typical end user license agreements do not contain acceptance clauses 
however  if acceptance criteria are required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance has occurred 
if these criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
there may be cases  however  in which there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s but no such evidence for the delivered item s 
in those cases  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to the delivered item s equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered item s 
we apply the revenue recognition policies discussed below to each separate unit of accounting 
astea allocates revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based on the elements respective fair value  determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
specifically  astea determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the price  at the date of sale  if sold separately  which is generally a fixed percentage of the software license selling price 
the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on hourly rates which the company charges for those services when sold separately from software 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
if an undelivered element for which evidence of fair value does not exist  all revenue in an arrangement is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered or fair value can be determined 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
the proportion of the revenue recognized upon delivery can vary from quarter to quarter depending upon the determination of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of undelivered elements 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
when appropriate  the company may allocate a portion of its software revenue to post contract support activities or to other services or products provided to the customer free of charge or at non standard rates when provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement 
amounts allocated are based upon standard prices charged for those services or products which  in the company s opinion  approximate fair value 
software license fees for resellers or other members of the indirect sales channel are based on a fixed percentage of the company s standard prices 
the company recognizes software license revenue for such contracts based upon the terms and conditions provided by the reseller to its customer 
revenue from post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally twelve months on a straight line basis 
consulting and training service revenue is generally unbundled and recognized at the time the service is performed 
if the company does have any fixed price arrangements for services the revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method based on direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated direct labor hours required to complete the project 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment  provided that the contract has been executed  delivery of the software has occurred  fees are fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
we believe that our accounting estimates used in applying our revenue recognition are critical because the determination that it is probable that the customer will pay for the products and services purchased is inherently judgmental  the allocation of proceeds to certain elements in multiple element arrangements is complex  the determination of whether a service is essential to the functionality of the software is complex  establishing company specific fair values of elements in multiple element arrangements requires adjustments from time to time to reflect recent prices charged when each element is sold separately  and the determination of the stage of completion for certain consulting arrangements is complex 
changes in the aforementioned items could have a material effect on the type and timing of revenue recognized 
if we were to change our pricing approach in the future  this could affect our revenue recognition estimates  in particular  if bundled pricing precludes establishment of vsoe 
we present taxes assessed by a governmental authority including sales  use  value added and excise taxes on a net basis and  therefore  the presentation of these taxes is excluded from our revenues and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until such amounts are remitted to the taxing authority 
cost of software license fees cost of software license fees includes amortization of the capitalized software development costs and third party licenses sold to customers 
cost of services and maintenance cost of services and maintenance includes compensation and benefits provided to our professional service employees  independent consultants  telecommunication cost  unreimbursed travel expenses and allocated facility costs 
product development product development costs include our research and development expenses which consist primarily of personnel and related costs  including salaries and employee benefits for software engineers 
to date  our product development efforts have been devoted to new products and service offerings and increases in features and functionality of our existing products and services 
sales and marketing sales and marketing costs include compensation  commissions and benefits paid to our sales and marketing teams  telecommunication costs  marketing and sales costs  professional fees and facility costs 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs include salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  external accounting and audit costs  bad debt expense  professional fees  corporate facility costs and other costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to ten years for computers and related equipment  furniture and fixtures  software and office equipment  and the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from five to ten years 
deferred revenue deferred revenue includes amounts billed to or received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
this generally results from post contract support  software installation  consulting and training services not yet rendered or license revenue which has been deferred until all revenue recognition requirements have been met or services are performed 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its customer accounts that are significantly past due  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general strength of the economy  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment by the management of the company 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
unbilled receivables are established when revenue is deemed to be recognized based on the company s revenue recognition policy  but due to contractual restraints over timing of invoicing  the company does not have the right to invoice the customer 
we believe that our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts is critical because of the significance of our accounts receivable balance relative to total assets 
if the general economy deteriorated  or factors affecting the profitability or liquidity of the industry changed significantly  then this could affect the accuracy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
capitalized software and research and development costs the company capitalizes software development costs incurred during the period subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility through the product s availability for general release 
costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to product development expense 
product development expense includes payroll  employee benefits  other headcount related costs associated with product development and any related costs to third parties under sub contracting or net of any collaborative arrangements 
software development costs are amortized on a product by product basis over the greater of the ratio of current revenues to total anticipated revenues or on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the products beginning with the initial release to customers 
the company s estimated life for its capitalized software products is two years based on current sales trends and the rate of product release 
the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the remaining useful life of the capitalized software development costs should be revised or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of capitalized software based on the estimated future revenues of each product 
as of december   management believes that no revisions to the remaining useful lives or write downs of capitalized software development costs are required 
we believe that our estimate of our capitalized software costs and the period for their amortization is critical because of the significance of our balance of capitalized software costs relative to our total assets 
potential impairment is determined by comparing the balance of unamortized capitalized software costs to the sales revenue projected for a capitalized software product 
if efforts to sell that software product are terminated  or if the projected sales revenue from that software product drops below a level that is less than the unamortized balance  then an impairment would be recognized 
goodwill part of the purchase price for the fieldcentrix assets  acquired september   included the acquisition of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october it is also tested between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist  as for example when the company s market capitalization significantly declines for a sustained period  using a fair value based approach 
in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the company elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of its fourth quarter of on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests 
in accordance with the new guidance  the company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if the company believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary 
if necessary  the company applies a two step method for determining goodwill impairment  the market and income approaches 
the market approach analyzes the market valuations of similar companies in our peer group based on recent market conditions 
the income approach analyzes the company s expectation for future results based on current and expected economic conditions 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within the reporting unit requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the company competes  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  and forecasts of revenue  operating income  depreciation and amortization  cash flows and capital expenditures 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets with finite lives excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment of acquired intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented 
stock based compensation option plans the company records stock based compensation using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation costs recognized in include a compensation costs for all share based payments granted to employees and directors prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date value estimated and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value 
the fair value of stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes closed form option valuation model 
this model requires the input of assumptions including expected stock price volatility  expected term and estimated forfeitures of each award 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is provided when we estimate that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized through future operations 
this assessment is based upon consideration of available positive and negative evidence which includes  among other things  our most recent results of operations and expected future profitability 
we consider our actual historical results to have a stronger weight than other more subjective indicators when considering whether to establish or reduce a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of net deferred tax assets  against which we provided a valuation allowance 
our net deferred tax assets were generated primarily by operating losses 
accordingly  it is more likely than not  that we will not realize these assets through future operations 
the company prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
estimated interest is recorded as a component of interest expense and penalties are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses 
in  the israel taxing authority ita notified the company that it intended to re examine a transaction that it had previously approved 
during the course of the examination  the ita also reviewed the years through in january  a comprehensive settlement covering the tax years through was completed for a total settlement of  convertible preferred stock on september  the company issued  shares of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock to its chief executive officer at a price of per share for a total of  dividends accrue daily on the series a preferred stock at an initial rate of and are payable only when  as and if declared by the company s board of directors  quarterly in arrears 
the series a preferred stock may be converted into common stock at the initial rate of one share of common for each share of series a preferred stock 
after six months from issuance there is no limit on the number of shares that may be converted 
commencing two years after issuance  the company shall have certain rights to cause conversion of all of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding 
commencing four years after issuance  the company may redeem  subject to board approval  all of the shares of series a preferred stock then outstanding at a price equal to the greater of i of the purchase price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends and ii the fair market value of such number of shares of common stock which the holder of the series a preferred stock would be entitled to receive had the redeemed series a preferred stock been converted immediately prior to the redemption 
the company recorded the series a preferred stock on the company s consolidated balance sheet within stockholders equity 
the series a preferred stock is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount of net proceeds received less an imputed dividend cost 
the imputed dividend cost of  was the result of the series a preferred stock having a dividend rate during the first two years after its issuance that is lower than the rate that becomes fixed after the initial two year period 
the imputed dividend cost of  was amortized over the first two years from the date of issuance and is based upon the present value of the dividend discount using a yield 
recently adopted accounting guidance in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
we adopted the new guidance beginning october  adoption of this new guidance has not had a material impact on our financial statements 
recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
instead  an entity will be required to present either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate consecutive statements 
the new guidance also required entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented 
in december  the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning january  and will only result in financial statement presentation changes 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  selected financial data and the percentages of the company s total revenues represented by each line item presented for the periods presented years ended december  revenues software license fees services and maintenance total revenues costs and expenses cost of software license fees cost of services and maintenance product development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses interest income provision for income tax net income loss comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
total revenues increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  software license revenues increased in  compared to services and maintenance fees for amounted to  a increase from software license fee revenues increased  or to  in from  in astea alliance license revenues increased to  in from  in  an increase of 
the increase resulted from astea license sales in all regions of the company to both new and existing customers 
the company sold  of fieldcentrix licenses in compared to  in  an increase of 
the increase was the result of having a greater distribution of sales to new and existing customers in compared to only one new customer in total services and maintenance revenues increased  or to  in from  in service and maintenance revenue increased  or on the astea alliance products 
the primary cause of the increase in astea alliance service and maintenance revenue resulted from an increase in implementation projects due to higher license sales 
in addition  there were a number of ongoing projects as well as upgrades of existing customers from older versions of the company s software to its latest version 
fieldcentrix service and maintenance revenue decreased  or due to reduced demand from customers and a reduction in license sales in for the year ended december  there was one customer that represented or more of total revenues and for the year ended december  there were no customers that represented or more of total revenues 
costs of revenues 
costs of software license fees decreased to  in from  in included in the cost of software license fees is the fixed cost of capitalized software amortization 
the principal cause of the decrease results from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized software costs partially offset by an increase in third party costs due to the increase in license sales in amortization of capitalized software decreased to  in from  in the gross margin percentage on software license sales was in and in the improvement in license gross margin resulted primarily from the increase in license revenues and decreased amortization of capitalized software development costs 
costs of services and maintenance increased to  in from  in the increase in cost of service and maintenance is attributed primarily to an increase in headcount from last year to this year 
the service and maintenance gross margin percentage increased slightly to in from in the increased margin was primarily attributable to an increase in alliance professional services as a direct result of an increase in licenses sales in partially offset by lower demand of fieldcentrix professional services in product development 
product development expense decreased  or  to  in from  in the decrease was primarily due to the increase in capitalized cost in compared to offset partially by an increase in headcount 
fluctuations in product development expense from period to period can vary due to the amount of product development expense which is capitalized 
software development costs of  were capitalized in compared to  during the same period in in  the company began several new development projects which added significant functionality to its existing version of its astea alliance products compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company released version of its astea alliance product in january  at which time capitalization of development costs ceased for that project 
gross development expense was  in  a increase from  in product development as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in the decrease in costs relative to revenues is due to the increase in revenues  as gross development expenses increased in compared to sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in sales and marketing expense is attributable to an increase in marketing efforts in  increase in salaries  and an increase in commissions from higher licenses sales  partially offset by a decrease in outside consultants 
the company continues to focus on improving its market presence through intensified marketing efforts to increase awareness of the company s products 
this occurs through the use of webinars focused in the vertical industries in which the company operates  attendance at selected trade shows  and increased efforts in lead generation for its sales force 
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues remained at for both and general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  benefits and related costs for the company s finance  administrative and executive management personnel  legal costs  accounting costs  bad debt expense and various costs associated with the company s status as a public company 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  in from  in the increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to the increase in headcount  increases in operating expenses in our japanese subsidiary and management bonuses accrued in the first quarter of partially offset by a decrease in outside consulting fees 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses amounted to in compared to in the slight decrease in expenses relative to revenues primarily results from the increase in revenues in interest income 
interest income decreased  to  in from  in the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in investments throughout and the decline in interest rates paid on invested cash 
income tax expense 
the company recorded a provision of  in and  in for income taxes 
in and   and  respectively  of expense resulted from a difference between an indefinite lived asset  goodwill  which is amortized for tax  but not amortized for financial reporting purposes 
the remaining increase was a result of the tax settlement in israel  as well as  income tax due for income earned in israel because of the company no longer having a tax holiday in israel 
international operations 
total revenues from the company s international operations increased by  or to  in from  in the increase resulted from new astea license sales in the asia pacific and japan regions to new and existing customers  as well as an increase in professional service revenue in europe 
overall  international operations generated a net loss of  for compared to net income of  in the decrease in net income was primarily related to increases in head count in all international locations  as well as  expenses related to the additional license sales in such as third party license costs and commissions 
net income loss 
the company generated net income of  for the year ended december  compared to net loss of  in the increase in income of  is primarily the result of a increase in revenues  partially offset by a increase in operating expenses 
the increase in revenue is mainly attributable to the increase in license sales in the us  japan  and asia pacific to new and existing customers 
the increase in operating expense was primarily due to increase in headcount in in all regions of the company 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   an increase of  over the year ended december  in which  of cash was generated by operations 
the increase was attributable to an increase in net income of  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  a decrease in prepaid expense of  and a decrease in other long term assets of  offsetting the increases in cash flow were an increase in accounts receivable of  and a decrease in deferred revenue of  in addition  there was a decrease of  related to non cash activities 
investing activities the company used  of cash for investing activities in compared to using  in the increase in cash used for investing activities is attributable to higher capitalized software costs of  higher purchases of short term investments by  a decrease in sales for  of short term investments  and an increase of  in restricted cash offset by a decrease of  in the purchases of property and equipment 
financing activities the company used an additional  in financing activities in compared to the only financing expenditures in and were payments of preferred stock dividends which in were  compared to  in the dividend payments increased in accordance with the certificate of designation of the series a convertible preferred stock 
the financing inflow in and occurred from the exercise of stock options which provided  and  respectively 
due to the weakening of the us dollar related to most other currencies in which the company operates  primarily the australian dollar  japanese yen  the euro  the british pound sterling and israel shekel  the effect of exchange rates on cash provided an outflow of  in compared to an outflow of  in at december   the company had a working capital ratio of approximately 
compared to at december  the company had  in cash and investments available for sale at december   compared to  at december  the company has projected revenues for that will generate enough funds to sustain its continuing operations 
in addition  the company has continued with a number of cost containment programs which are expected to monitor the cost of operating the business 
the company expects its cash from operations to fund all of its financing needs for the upcoming year 
however  if actual results trail expectations  the company has plans in place to reduce operating expenditures appropriately in order to continue to fund all required expenditures 
the board of directors from time to time reviews the company s forecasted operations and financial condition to determine whether and when payment of a dividend or dividends is appropriate 
the company does not plan any significant capital expenditures in other than to replace its existing capital equipment as it becomes obsolete 
in addition  it does not anticipate that its operations or financial condition will be affected materially by inflation 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual and commercial obligations  as of december  payment due by period total and after contractual cash obligations long term debt capital leases operating leases dividends may be paid on common stock  when and if  declared by the board of directors 
however  no dividend has been paid on common stock since january dividends on convertible preferred stock were payable at until september  payable on a quarterly basis in arrears  as declared by the board of directors 
if not paid  the rate increased to until paid 
in september  the dividend was increased to 
off balance sheet transactions there are no off balance sheet transactions that would require disclosure in the above contractual obligations and commercial commitments table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio 
the company does not have any derivative financial instruments in its portfolio 
the company places its investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
the company is adverse to principal loss and ensures the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
as a result  as of december   the company s investments consisted of mutual funds 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk all costs associated with the company s foreign operations in europe  asia pacific  japan and israel are denominated in their respective local currencies and translated into us dollars for financial reporting 
as a result  the company is exposed to risks to the extent that the rate of inflation in any of its foreign operating regions differs from the rate of revaluation of their related currencies in relation to the us dollar or if the timing of such revaluations lags behind inflation in these regions 
in such an event  the costs of the company s operations in these regions  measured in us dollars  will change and the us dollar measured results of operations will be affected 
the company does not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows or for trading purposes 
all sales arrangements with international customers are denominated in foreign currency 
the company does not expect any material loss with respect to foreign currency risk
