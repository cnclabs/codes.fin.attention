regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other provisions of the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
we calculate ebitda as net income before a interest expense  net  b provision for income taxes  and c depreciation and amortization 
we calculate ebitdar by adjusting ebitda to exclude facility rent cost of services 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
we believe ebitda and ebitdar are useful to investors and other external users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because they are widely used by investors and analysts in our industry as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry without regard to items such as interest expense  net and depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  and they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
we use ebitda and ebitdar as measurements of our operating performance to assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis  to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business  to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  and to compare our operating performance to that of our competitors 
we typically use ebitda and ebitdar to compare the operating performance of each skilled nursing and assisted living facility 
ebitda and ebitdar are useful in this regard because they do not include such costs as net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  and  with respect to ebitdar  facility rent cost of services  which may vary from period to period depending upon various factors  including the method used to finance facilities  the amount of debt that we have incurred  whether a facility is owned or leased  the date of acquisition of a facility or business  and the tax law of the state in which a business unit operates 
as a result  we believe that the use of ebitda and ebitdar provide a meaningful and consistent comparison of our business between periods by eliminating certain items required by gaap 
we also establish compensation programs and bonuses for our facility level employees that are partially based upon the achievement of ebitdar targets 
despite the importance of these measures in analyzing our underlying business  designing incentive compensation and for our goal setting  ebitda and ebitdar are non gaap financial measures that have no standardized meaning defined by gaap 
therefore  our ebitda and ebitdar measures have limitations as analytical tools  and they should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our current or future cash requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  they do not reflect the net interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  they do not reflect any income tax payments we may be required to make  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and ebitdar do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do  which may limit their usefulness as comparative measures 
we compensate for these limitations by using them only to supplement net income on a basis prepared in accordance with gaap in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
because these non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names

see further discussion of facility acquisitions in note to the consolidated financial statements below 
key performance indicators we manage our skilled nursing business by monitoring key performance indicators that affect our financial performance 
these indicators and their definitions include the following routine revenue routine revenue is generated by the contracted daily rate charged for all contractually inclusive skilled nursing services 
the inclusion of therapy and other ancillary treatments varies by payor source and by contract 
services provided outside of the routine contractual agreement are recorded separately as ancillary revenue  including medicare part b therapy services  and are not included in the routine revenue definition 
skilled revenue the amount of routine revenue generated from patients in our skilled nursing facilities who are receiving higher levels of care under medicare  managed care  medicaid  or other skilled reimbursement programs 
the other skilled residents that are included in this population represent very high acuity residents who are receiving high levels of nursing and ancillary services which are reimbursed by payors other than medicare or managed care 
skilled revenue excludes any revenue generated from our assisted living services 
skilled mix the amount of our skilled revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
skilled mix in days represents the number of days our medicare  managed care  or other skilled patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients less days from assisted living services from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given period less days from assisted living services 
quality mix the amount of routine non medicaid revenue as a percentage of our total routine revenue 
quality mix in days represents the number of days our non medicaid patients are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities divided by the total number of days patients from all payor sources are receiving services at our skilled nursing facilities for any given period less days from assisted living services 
average daily rates the routine revenue by payor source for a period at our skilled nursing facilities divided by actual patient days for that revenue source for that given period 
occupancy percentage operational beds the total number of residents occupying a bed in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility as a percentage of the beds in a facility which are available for occupancy during the measurement period 
number of facilities and operational beds the total number of skilled nursing  assisted living and independent living facilities that we own or operate and the total number of operational beds associated with these facilities 
skilled and quality mix 
like most skilled nursing providers  we measure both patient days and revenue by payor 
medicare  managed care and other skilled patients  whom we refer to as high acuity patients  typically require a higher level of skilled nursing and rehabilitative care 
accordingly  medicare and managed care reimbursement rates are typically higher than from other payors 
in most states  medicaid reimbursement rates are generally the lowest of all payor types 
changes in the payor mix can significantly affect our revenue and profitability 
the following table summarizes our overall skilled mix and quality mix for the periods indicated as a percentage of our total routine revenue less revenue from assisted living services and as a percentage of total patient days less days from assisted living services year ended december  skilled mix days revenue quality mix days revenue occupancy 
we define occupancy as the ratio of actual patient days one patient day equals one resident occupying one bed for one day during any measurement period to the number of beds in facilities which are available for occupancy during the measurement period 
the number of licensed and independent living beds in a skilled nursing  assisted living or independent living facility that are actually operational and available for occupancy may be less than the total official licensed bed capacity 
this sometimes occurs due to the permanent dedication of bed space to alternative purposes  such as enhanced therapy treatment space or other desirable uses calculated to improve service offerings and or operational efficiencies in a facility 
in some cases  three and four bed wards have been reduced to two bed rooms for resident comfort  and larger wards have been reduced to conform to changes in medicare requirements 
these beds are seldom expected to be placed back into service 
we define occupancy in operational beds as the ratio of actual patient days during any measurement period to the number of available patient days for that period 
we believe that reporting occupancy based on operational beds is consistent with industry practices and provides a more useful measure of actual occupancy performance from period to period 
the following table summarizes our occupancy statistics for the periods indicated year ended december  occupancy operational beds at end of period available patient days actual patient days occupancy percentage based on operational beds revenue sources our total revenue represents revenue derived primarily from providing services to patients and residents of skilled nursing facilities  and to a lesser extent from assisted living facilities and ancillary services 
we receive service revenue from medicaid  medicare  private payors and other third party payors  and managed care sources 
the sources and amounts of our revenue are determined by a number of factors  including bed capacity and occupancy rates of our healthcare facilities  the mix of patients at our facilities and the rates of reimbursement among payors 
payment for ancillary services varies based upon the service provided and the type of payor 
the following table sets forth our total revenue by payor source and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated december  in thousands revenue medicaid custodial medicare medicaid skilled total managed care private and other total revenue primary components of expense cost of services exclusive of facility rent and depreciation and amortization shown separately 
our cost of services represents the costs of operating our facilities and primarily consists of payroll and related benefits  supplies  purchased services  and ancillary expenses such as the cost of pharmacy and therapy services provided to residents 
cost of services also includes the cost of general and professional liability insurance and other general cost of services with respect to our facilities 
facility rent cost of services 
facility rent cost of services consists solely of base minimum rent amounts payable under lease agreements to third party owners of the facilities that we operate but do not own and does not include taxes  insurance  impounds  capital reserves or other charges payable under the applicable lease agreements 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and related benefits and travel expenses for our service center personnel  including training and other operational support 
general and administrative expense also includes professional fees including accounting and legal fees  costs relating to our information systems  stock based compensation and rent for our service center office 
depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are recorded at their original historical cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets 
the following is a summary of the depreciable lives of our depreciable assets buildings and improvements to years leasehold improvements shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life  generally to years furniture and equipment to years critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis we review our judgments and estimates  including those related to doubtful accounts  income taxes  stock compensation  intangible assets and loss contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments upon our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our belief of what could occur in the future considering available information  including assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b require management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four conditions have been met i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our revenue is derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services to residents and is recognized on the date services are provided at amounts billable to individual residents 
for residents under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including medicaid  medicare and private insurers  revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon amounts on a per patient  daily basis 
revenue from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for and of our revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we record revenue from these governmental and managed care programs as services are performed at their expected net realizable amounts under these programs 
our revenue from governmental and managed care programs is subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by governmental and third party agencies 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  any changes to these governmental revenue estimates are recorded in the period the change or adjustment becomes known based on final settlements 
we recorded retroactive adjustments that increased decreased revenue by million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from retroactive revenue adjustments in was partially offset by the item disclosed under other matters in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
retroactive revenue adjustments increased revenue by million for the year ended december  prior to the item disclosed in note the decrease in revenue from retroactive revenue adjustments in is attributable to the repayment of estimated overpayments received at one facility in the second quarter of retroactive revenue adjustments increased revenue by million for the year ended december  prior to the adjustment noted above 
the company s service specific revenue recognition policies are as follows skilled nursing revenue our revenue is derived primarily from providing long term healthcare services to residents and is recognized on the date services are provided at amounts billable to individual residents 
for residents under reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  including medicaid  medicare and private insurers  revenue is recorded based on contractually agreed upon amounts on a per patient  daily basis 
we record revenue from private pay patients  at the agreed upon rate  as services are performed 
home health and hospice revenue recognition episodic based revenue net service revenue is typically recorded on a day episode payment rate 
we make adjustments to revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we record an estimate for the impact of such payment adjustments based on its historical experience 
in addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes  we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress 
episodes in progress are day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period  but were not completed as of the end of the period 
we estimate this revenue on a monthly basis based upon historical trends 
the primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period  expected medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on days completed of the episode of care 
non episodic based revenue gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
hospice revenue gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates 
the estimated payment rates are daily rates for each of the levels of care we deliver 
we make adjustments to revenue for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of these adjustments based on its historical experience  which primarily includes historical collection rates on medicare claims  and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
additionally  as medicare hospice revenue is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap  we monitor our provider numbers and estimate amounts due back to medicare if a cap has been exceeded 
we record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and increase other accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans and private payor sources 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type and the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors 
the percentages applied to the aged receivable balances are based on our historical experience and time limits  if any  for managed care  medicare  medicaid and other payors 
we periodically refine our estimates of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on experience with the estimation process and changes in circumstances 
self insurance we are partially self insured for general and professional liability up to a base amount per claim the self insured retention with an aggregate  one time deductible above this limit 
losses beyond these amounts are insured through third party policies with coverage limits per occurrence  per location and on an aggregate basis for us 
for claims made after april   the combined self insured retention was million per claim with an aggregate million deductible limit 
for all facilities  except those located in colorado  the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence  million per facility  with a million blanket aggregate and an additional state specific aggregate where required by state law 
in colorado  the third party coverage above these limits was million per occurrence and million per facility  which is independent of the million blanket aggregate applicable to our other facilities 
the self insured retention and deductible limits for general and professional liability and worker s compensation are self insured through the captive  the related assets and liabilities of which are included in the accompanying financial statements 
the captive is subject to certain statutory requirements as an insurance provider 
these requirements include  but are not limited to  maintaining statutory capital 
our policy is to accrue amounts equal to the actuarially estimated costs to settle open claims of insureds  as well as an estimate of the cost of insured claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we develop information about the size of the ultimate claims based on historical experience  current industry information and actuarial analysis  and evaluate the estimates for claim loss exposure on a quarterly basis 
our operating subsidiaries are self insured for workers compensation liability in california 
to protect ourself against loss exposure in california with this policy  we purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each claim 
in texas  the operating subsidiaries have elected non subscriber status for workers compensation claims and  effective february   we purchased individual stop loss coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each claim 
our operating subsidiaries in other states have third party guaranteed cost coverage 
in california and texas  we accrue amounts equal to the estimated costs to settle open claims  as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
we use actuarial valuations to estimate the liability based on historical experience and industry information 
we provide self insured medical including prescription drugs and dental healthcare benefits to the majority of our employees 
we are fully liable for all financial and legal aspects of these benefit plans 
to protect ourself against loss exposure with this policy  we purchased individual stop loss insurance coverage that insures individual claims that exceed million for each covered person with an aggregate individual stop loss deductible of approximately million 
in addition  in accordance with guidance provided by the financial accounting standards board fasb in august  we recorded an asset and equal liability in order to present the ultimate costs of malpractice claims and the anticipated insurance recoveries on a gross basis 
prior to fiscal year  these liabilities were recorded net of anticipated insurance recoveries 
see additional discussion in adoption of new accounting pronouncements below 
we believe that adequate provision has been made in the financial statements for liabilities that may arise out of patient care  workers compensation  healthcare benefits and related services provided to date 
the amount of our reserves was determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data 
this estimation process requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of the claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about emerging trends  we  with the assistance of an independent actuary  develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on our historical experience and other available industry information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in costs  the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported and the expected costs to settle or pay damage awards with respect to unpaid claims 
the self insured liabilities are based upon estimates  and while management believes that the estimates of loss are reasonable  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the recorded amounts 
due to the inherent volatility of actuarially determined loss estimates  it is reasonably possible that we could experience changes in estimated losses that could be material to net income 
if our actual liability exceeds our estimates of loss  our future earnings and financial condition  and cash flows would be adversely affected 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates in effect when such temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we generally expect to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  however  when necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when we take uncertain income tax positions that do not meet the recognition criteria  we record a liability for underpayment of income taxes and related interest and penalties  if any 
in considering the need for and magnitude of a liability for such positions  we must consider the potential outcomes from a review of the positions by the taxing authorities 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the annual income tax rate  or the need for and magnitude of liabilities for uncertain tax positions  we make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on  among other things  knowledge of operations  markets  historical trends and likely future changes and  when appropriate  the opinions of advisors with knowledge and expertise in certain fields 
due to certain risks associated with our estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ 
derivatives and hedging activities we evaluate variable and fixed interest rate risk exposure on a routine basis and to the extent we believe that it is appropriate  will offset its variable risk exposure by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
it is our policy to only utilize derivative instruments for hedging purposes ie not for speculation 
we formally designate our interest rate swap agreements as hedges and document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items 
we formally assess effectiveness of our hedging relationships  both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis  then measure and record ineffectiveness 
we would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively i if it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting change in the cash flows of a hedged item  ii when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  iii if it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  or iv if management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
our derivative is recorded on the balance sheet at its fair value 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new standard gives entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step one of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  further testing would not be needed 
we do not believe the adoption of this amendment will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb amended its standards on how health care entities present revenue and bad debt expense 
under the new guidance  health care entities are required to present bad debt expense related to patient service revenue as a reduction of patient service revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts on the statement of income for entities that do not assess a patient s ability to pay prior to rendering services 
further  it was determined  net presentation of bad debt expense in revenue would only apply to bad debts that are related to patient service revenue  to entities that provide services prior to assessing a patient s ability to pay  or to entities that recognize revenue prior to deciding that collection is reasonably assured 
in addition  the final consensus requires health care entities to disclose information about the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts  such as recoveries and write offs  by using a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data 
it will also require disclosure of our policies for i assessing the timing and amount of uncollectible revenue recognized as bad debt expense  and ii assessing collectability in the timing and amount of revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts 
the final consensus will be applied retrospectively effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact of the final consensus  but believe  if this standard is applicable  the final result will be an equivalent reduction in patient service revenue and cost of services exclusive of facility rent and depreciation and amortization for no net impact on the statement of income 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb revised the manner in which companies present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removed the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and instead required presenting in one continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
this revision is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of see statement of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
in december  the fasb amended its standards on performing step two of a goodwill impairment analysis 
the amendment does not prescribe a specific method of calculating the carrying value of a reporting unit in the performance of step one of the goodwill impairment test and requires entities with a zero or negative carrying value to assess  considering qualitative factors such as those listed in accounting standards codification asc intangibles goodwill and other  whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  the entity must perform step two of the goodwill impairment test 
for public entities  these amendments are effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years that begin after december  we adopted this amendment during our goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of the current year 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb provided clarification regarding pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
these amendments specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose only revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period on or after december  we adopted these amendments on january   noting they did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in august  the fasb clarified that health care entities should not net insurance recoveries against related claim liability 
such entities should determine the claim liability without considering insurance recoveries 
further  it was determined a cumulative effect adjustment should be recognized in opening retained earnings in the period of adoption if a difference exists between any liabilities and insurance receivables recorded as a result of applying these amendments

approximately million of the total revenue increase was due to revenue generated by recently acquired facilities 
since january   the company has acquired facilities  four home health and two hospice operations in eight states 
revenue generated by same facilities increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in skilled mix by nursing days of  to  which was the result of an increase in medicare patient days at same facilities of 
in addition  medicare revenue per patient day increased by during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to higher acuity and rate increases during the first three quarters of the year 
the revenue increase at same facilities occurred despite a minor decrease in patient days  due primarily to significant renovations at four facilities which temporarily removed operational beds from service that were completed in the fourth quarter of the following table reflects the change in the skilled nursing average daily revenue rates by payor source  excluding services that are not covered by the daily rate years ended december  same facility transitioning acquisitions total change skilled nursing average daily revenue rates medicare managed care other skilled total skilled revenue medicaid private and other payors total skilled nursing medicare daily rates increased by  due to rate increases during the first three quarters of the year and increased acuity levels throughout the year 
the above results include the impact of the implementation of rugs iv on revenue reimbursement and related concurrent therapy changes included in mds in addition  the results include the impact of the cms imposed reduction in medicare skilled nursing pps payments and therapy changes  which were implemented on october  the average medicaid rate increased for the year ended december  relative to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to increases in rates in several states and increased acuity in case mix states where rates were cut  partially offset by decreases in other states 
in addition  we have experienced continued growth in our managed care rates as we have and will continue to enhance our relationships with these organizations to appropriately service resident needs in their respective communities 
historically  we have generally experienced lower occupancy rates  lower skilled mix and quality mix at recently acquired facilities and therefore  we anticipate generally lower overall occupancy during years of growth 
in the future  if we acquire additional facilities into our overall portfolio  we expect this trend to continue 
accordingly  we anticipate our overall occupancy will vary from quarter to quarter based upon the maturity of the facilities within our portfolio 
payor sources as a percentage of skilled nursing services 
we use both our skilled mix and quality mix as measures of the quality of reimbursements we receive at our skilled nursing facilities over various periods

cost of services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  of the million increase  same facilities increased million  or and recently acquired facilities increased million 
the million increase in same facility cost of services was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits  a million increase in ancillary expenses and a million increase in insurance costs 
the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to increases in nursing wages and benefits due to increased services provided at same facilities 
the increase in ancillary expenses was primarily due to increased therapy wages 
the increase in insurance was primarily due to increased general and professional liability costs

facility rent cost of services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  facility rent cost of services decreased as a percent of total revenue to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in facility rent is due to our purchase of the underlying assets of five of our skilled nursing facilities in california  utah and idaho  which we previously operated under long term lease agreements  partially offset by normal annual increases in rent at leased facilities 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of total revenue to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the million increase was primarily due to increases in wages and benefits due to our growth and improved financial performance and increased legal fees associated with the ongoing investigation into the billing and reimbursement processes of some of our subsidiaries being conducted by the department of justice doj 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased as a percent of total revenue to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase was primarily related to the additional depreciation of million at recently acquired facilities  as well as increases of million and million at same and transitioning facilities  respectively  due to recent renovations and the purchase of the underlying asset of five of our skilled nursing facilities which we previously operated under a long term lease agreement 
of the million increase at recently acquired facilities  million represented amortization expense of patient base intangible assets which are amortized over four to twelve months 
other income expense 
other expense  net increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other expense  net increased as a percent of total revenue to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of increased interest expense due to the additional capacity of the new senior credit facility with a five bank lending consortium arranged by suntrust and wells fargo the facility and a one time exit fee and related extinguishment fees of million upon prepaying the six project note described below and exiting our revolving credit facility 
see further discussion of the facility in liquidity and capital resources section below 
in addition  the increase in interest expense was a result of the additional million in long term debt added with the promissory notes with rbs asset finance  inc rbs loan on december provision for income taxes

accordingly  the overall average medicare daily rate increased by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of the impact of lower acuity levels at transitioning and recently acquired facilities 
the average medicaid rate increased in the year ended december  relative to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to increases in rates in acuity based reimbursement states

the million increase in same facility cost of services was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits and a million increase in ancillary expenses  partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs of million 
the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to increases in nursing wages and benefits and the increase in ancillary expenses was primarily due to increased therapy wages 
the decrease in insurance was primarily due to decreased medical and dental healthcare benefits due to a decrease in current and projected claims

cash paid for business acquisitions was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash paid for asset acquisitions was million for the year ended december  there were no asset acquisitions executed in or where we enter into a facility lease agreement  we typically do not pay any material amount to the prior facility operator  nor do we acquire any assets or assume any liabilities  other than our rights and obligations under the new lease and operations transfer agreement  as part of the transaction

the remaining million debt security investments are aa rated 
our market risk exposure is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
due to the low risk profile of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio

in march  we learned that the united states attorney for the central district of california doj had commenced an investigation of certain of our facilities and had issued an authorized investigative demand to our bank seeking information pertaining to a total of of our facilities 
the doj also subsequently served a subpoena on our independent external auditors in  and in served search warrants and subpoenas on our service center and six of our southern california skilled nursing facilities  seeking specific patient files and other information 
subsequent subpoenas issued to us covered additional documentation from the six facilities as well as eight of the other facilities 
based upon the issuance of the subpoenas and execution of the search warrants  we concluded that the government had undertaken parallel criminal and civil investigations 
we pledged full cooperation to  and have been cooperating fully with  the government 
in september our board of directors appointed a special committee consisting solely of independent directors to advance discussions with the doj regarding its investigation 
the special committee retained independent counsel  and counsel has retained third party consultants  to facilitate its work 
the company and the special committee have continued cooperating with the doj  working to provide information necessary to aid the doj s investigation and move the matter toward resolution 
in december  independent counsel for our special committee received confirmation that the doj has closed its criminal investigation  although as a matter of course the doj reserves the right to reopen such inquiries if new facts come to light 
in january  the doj also indicated that the government would be seeking certain additional information in furtherance of the remaining investigation  and that it would formalize its request for that information in a new subpoena 
in january  the office of the inspector general of the united states department of health human services hhs served the new subpoena  seeking specific patient records and documents from to from the six southern california skilled nursing facilities that have been the subject of previous requests 
hhs also issued a subpoena to our independent external auditors requesting an update to the information requested in the subpoena to them  and a subpoena to our independent internal auditors requesting similar information 
we are in the process of gathering and producing the records requested of us  and discussions between government representatives and counsel for the special committee are ongoing 
we intend to continue cooperating with the government s representatives to move the matter toward resolution 
in addition  we continue to make improvements to our compliance programs and systems 
we cannot predict or provide any assurance as to the possible outcome of the investigations or any possible related proceedings  or as to the possible outcome of any litigation  nor can we estimate the possible loss or range of loss that may result from any such proceedings and  therefore  we have not recorded any related accruals 
if any litigation were to proceed  and we are subjected to  alleged to be liable for  or agree to a settlement of  claims or obligations under federal medicare statutes  the federal false claims act  or similar state and federal statutes and related regulations  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and our stock price could decline 
from time to time our systems and controls highlight potential compliance issues  which we investigate as they arise 
in the fourth quarter of we initiated an internal inquiry into possible recordkeeping and related irregularities at one skilled nursing facility  which were detected by our internal compliance team in the course of its ongoing reviews 
we concluded the inquiry in the first quarter of  having identified potential deficiencies in the assessment of and recordkeeping for a small subset of the facility s patients 
we also identified and  at the conclusion of the investigation assisted the facility in implementing  targeted improvements in the facility s assessment and recordkeeping practices to make them consistent with the existing standards and policies applicable to our skilled nursing facilities in these areas 
the issues detected appear to be isolated to the one facility  and to one department within that facility 
we continue to monitor the measures the facility has implemented for effectiveness  and will perform follow up reviews to ensure compliance 
consistent with healthcare industry accounting practices  we record any charge for refunded payments against revenue in the period in which the claim adjustment becomes known 
in the present matter  although the events leading to the actual and estimated overpayments covered multiple reporting periods  an allocation of the revenue adjustment to the prior periods would not have resulted in a material impact to revenue in any prior period 
therefore  during the quarter ended december   we accrued a revenue adjustment of approximately million for the actual and estimated overpayments described above  with a resulting impact to net income of approximately million in the quarter 
we intend to remit the accrued amount to its medicare fiscal intermediary in the first quarter of see additional description of our contingencies in notes  and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the medicare program 
we also derive revenue from state medicaid and similar reimbursement programs 
payments under these programs generally provide for reimbursement levels that are adjusted for inflation annually based upon the state s fiscal year for the medicaid programs and in each october for the medicare program 
these adjustments may not continue in the future  and even if received  such adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in our costs for providing healthcare services 
labor and supply expenses make up a substantial portion of our cost of services 
those expenses can be subject to increase in periods of rising inflation and when labor shortages occur in the marketplace 
to date  we have generally been able to implement cost control measures or obtain increases in reimbursement sufficient to offset increases in these expenses 
we may not be successful in offsetting future cost increases 
off balance sheet and other arrangements as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of borrowing capacity on the revolver pledged as collateral to secure outstanding letters of credit  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate changes in connection with the revolving credit facility portion of the facility  which is available but is not regularly used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to balance the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and maintain a lower interest rate 
to achieve this objective  we have historically borrowed primarily at fixed rates  although the revolving credit facility portion of the facility is available and could be used for short term borrowing purposes 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility portion of the facility of million 
the facility agreement exposes us to variability in interest payments due to changes in libor interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce risk from volatility in the income statement on the term loan portion of the facility 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  amortizing concurrently with the related term loan portion of the facility  is five years in length and set to mature on july  under the terms of this agreement  the net effect of the hedges was to record swap interest expense at a fixed rate of approximately 
our cash and cash equivalents as of december  consisted of bank term deposits  money market funds and treasury bill related investments 
in addition  as of december   we held debt security investments of approximately million  of which million are aaa rated and backed by the fdic under the temporary liquidity guarantee program upon maturity 
the remaining million debt security investments are aa rated 
our market risk exposure is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
due to the low risk profile of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
the above only incorporates those exposures that exist as of december   and does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
if we diversify our investment portfolio into securities and other investment alternatives  we may face increased risk and exposures as a result of interest risk and the securities markets in general
