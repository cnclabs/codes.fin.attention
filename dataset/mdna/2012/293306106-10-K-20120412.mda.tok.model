note to the financial statements contain segment information 
overview results of operations while englobal continues to face a number of challenges  we are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for despite recognizing losses in  we have experienced a significant improvement in our financial results  as compared to  reducing losses by 
in this regard  we have successfully reduced our expenses by reducing employee headcount  closing offices  as appropriate  discontinuing underperforming divisions  and creating an enhanced item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operational focus on cost controls 
cross selling efforts through our one englobal program are beginning to come to fruition with several large projects now underway and products such as the englobal power island appear to create significant potential for growth 
in addition  we are seeing an increase in capital project spending in the downstream refining  chemicals and petrochemicals sectors 
our wells fargo credit facility expires on may  however  we have competitive proposals from two major financial institutions and we are working toward entering into a new credit facility prior to that date or in obtaining an alternative source of financing 
while there can be no assurances that these challenges will be resolved  we believe that may be the year we will return to profitability and growth 
despite the relative increase in capital project spending in certain limited markets  we believe that overall  client spending continues to be limited  which we believe may be due to the uncertainty experienced by businesses in a presidential election year and the possible impact of proposed regulation of the oil and gas industry  such as the proposed fracking legislation 
in addition  pricing continues to be very competitive 
however  we have an ongoing  extremely focused marketing effort and we have seen an increase in proposal activity  as well as an increase in backlog 
in particular  we are focused on international expansion as we believe that the many significant projects will be located outside of the united states 
our one englobal philosophy is resulting in cross selling on large projects  and we expect to see this type of activity continue 
despite these efforts  we have not seen a significant increase in awards  and revenues increased only minimally from to  a situation which is receiving considerable management attention 
employee recruitment and retention continues to be an issue we are addressing 
to this end  we have improved employee benefits although not to levels and we believe employee morale has improved 
nevertheless  the market for qualified employees has become very active and  even after employees are hired  retention in a tight labor market has been challenging 
we continue our efforts to improve on timely collection of accounts receivable  and to focus on improving our internal systems  such as accounting and human resources 
we have encountered issues with collection of accounts receivable on a large international project due to administrative matters and this has had a negative impact on our cash flow but we believe that the issues surrounding this payment will be resolved in the short term 
we continue our efforts to improve on timely collection of accounts receivable  and to focus on improving our internal systems  such as accounting and human resources 
for several years  englobal has worked through certain litigation matters that have been the cause of a material portion of our losses 
while additional issues will undoubtedly arise in the future  we have resolved or established reserves which we believe to be adequate for material outstanding litigation issues 
with the exception of reclassifications related to our discontinued operations see below  total amounts reported for prior periods will remain the same  but amounts reported on a segment basis are reported in the three segments that the company now operates in  rather than the four segments in which the company previously operated and reported 
during the third quarter of  as part of its strategic evaluation of operations  the company determined that the anticipated future performance of the electrical services group did not warrant maintaining it as a part of the englobal suite of services 
as a result  effective july   the company initiated a plan to sell or  if necessary  ultimately terminate the operations of its electrical services group 
these assets and their related operations have been classified as discontinued operations and are presented as such in the company s re casted consolidated financial statements 
the net assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations are shown on the consolidated balance sheet as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale  respectively 
the results of the discontinued operations are shown on the consolidated statements of operations as a loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes 
pending the sale or termination of the electrical services group  we continue to abide by our contractual details to complete the projects to the client s satisfaction 
the engineering and construction segment provides services relating to the development  management and execution of projects requiring professional engineering and related project services primarily to the midstream and downstream item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sectors throughout the united states 
services provided by the engineering and construction segment include feasibility studies  engineering  design  procurement and construction management 
the automation segment provides services related to the design  fabrication and implementation of process distributed control and analyzer systems  advanced automation  information technology  electrical and heat tracing projects primarily to the upstream and downstream sectors throughout the united states as well as specific projects in the middle east and central asia 
the field solutions segment provides inspection  land management  right of way  environmental compliance  legislative affairs support and governmental regulatory compliance services primarily to the midstream sector  including pipeline  utility and telecommunications companies and other owner operators of infrastructure facilities throughout the united states 
the company s revenue is composed of engineering  procurement and construction management epcm services revenue and the sale of fabricated engineered automation systems 
the company recognizes service revenue as soon as the services are performed 
the majority of the company s engineering services have historically been provided through time and material contracts whereas a majority of the company s engineered automation system sales are earned on fixed price contracts 
in the course of providing our services  we routinely provide materials and equipment and may provide construction or construction management services on a subcontractor basis 
generally  these materials  equipment and subcontractor costs are passed through to our clients and reimbursed  along with handling fees  which in total are at margins lower than those of our normal core business 
in accordance with industry practice and generally accepted accounting principles  all such costs and fees are included in revenue 
the use of subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  therefore  changes in revenue and gross profit  sg a expense and operating income as a percent of revenue may not be indicative of the company s core business trends 
operating sg a expense includes management and staff compensation  office costs such as rents and utilities  depreciation  amortization  travel  bad debt and other expenses generally unrelated to specific client contracts  but directly related to the support of a segment s operations 
all other sg a expense is comprised primarily of business development costs  as well as costs related to executive  investor relations governance  finance  accounting  health safety environmental  human resources  legal and information technology departments and other costs generally unrelated to specific projects but which are incurred to support corporate activities and initiatives

overall revenue increased in as a result of project work from new clients 
however  the majority of the increase was due to million of additional work from existing clients 
in addition  revenues were impacted by existing projects that were either finished or saw significantly diminished activity during the month period 
our clients are continuing to perform run and maintain type smaller projects which focus on work for required maintenance to keep the plant up and running but not on new capital expansions 
competition for the project work on the market continues to be intense 
our revenue decrease from to was a result of our clients continued cancellation or delay of scheduled capital projects due to the economy in general  lower energy commodity prices and lower energy processing margins 
our clients were continuing to perform run and maintain type smaller projects which focus on work for required maintenance to keep the plant up and running but not on new capital expansions 
competition had also increased greatly for the amount of project work on the market 
in addition  revenues were impacted by the completion of several larger projects which were not replaced with new project work 
gross profit the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in relative to was caused by several factors including lower travel expenses as part of an operational focus on cost control  lower material costs as a function of current project requirements and lower variable labor costs due to an operational focus on utilization  resulting in higher margins 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in relative to was caused by several factors including lower utilization of our billable resources  resulting in increased overhead costs to retain employees  increased overhead costs to expand our marketing to new sectors and new clients  increased per employee costs of benefits and market pressure to renegotiate some of our existing contracts  resulting in lower margins 
also  we had significant increases in procurement activities which are generally performed at lower margins than labor 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the decrease in operating sg a expense for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  primarily consisted of decreases in bad debt expense of million mainly attributable to the sle receivable write off in also  the electrical services group in our automation segment moved to a smaller facility  reducing facilities expense by million 
we are now in the process of selling certain electrical assets and terminating the operations of that division which should further decrease our sg a

operating profit the increase in operating income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was attributable to higher revenue levels as well as decreased costs for both travel expenses and variable labor  due to increased focus on cost controls and improved utilization 
these decreased costs contributed to higher operating income as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in operating income for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the comparable period  was attributable to lower revenue levels as well as increased costs for both new sales efforts  maintaining core employees at a time when the company had fewer projects and the sle and bigler write offs 
these increased costs contributed to lower operating income as a percentage of revenue as well as decreased contract margins in response to market pressures 
other income expense other expense decreased in compared to the same period in due mainly to a decrease in investments written off in of approximately  compared to other expenses in of approximately  other expense in consisted primarily of approximately  paid in government penalties 
other expense for the same period in mainly consisted of  to write off an investment with a developer that was unable to obtain project financing and  in taxes  offset by income of  for a legal settlement 
other income in mainly consisted of  from insurance proceeds related to hurricane ike  offset by expense of  in losses from an investment in a costa rican company

this is consistent with our strategic long term view of these markets 
the engineering and construction segment s estimated backlog at december  was million 
our detail design service revenues increased by from to  but decreased by from to the increase in reflects the increased capital spending by our traditional clients for both in plant seconded technical staff and for engineering  design  procurement and construction management services 
the decrease in was mainly due to decreased demand for engineering and related professional services for energy related projects 
this decrease in demand was caused by delayed or canceled capital project work by clients in reaction to the economy 
this area of service revenues was impacted the most due to the level of capital work that is performed in this area 
our field services revenues decreased by from to  but increased by from to in  our clients demands decreased as a reaction to the economy 
however  we are now exploring the possibility of marketing to a broader range of prospective clients 
revenue from procurement services increased from to and increased significantly from to the increase in was the result of additional volume of procurement for epc contracts due to increases in midstream and government services arenas 
the significant increase in  as compared to the comparable period  was due to work performed for a new client that was expanding a gas field with exhuming  holding and loading functionality 
fixed price revenues increased from to and again by from to due to the current economy and increased activity in the midstream sector where fixed price projects are common  more clients are requesting work to be performed on a fixed price basis to control their costs and shift risk to their contractors 
we expect to continue to see increased trends in this type of work awarded by the clients

the overall increase in our fabrication revenue from to is due to the power island installations  the start of the caspian project and renewed interest in remote instrument enclosures rie and continuous emission monitoring cem buildings 
the overall decrease in our fabrication revenue from to was mainly attributable to the completion of large international analytical projects in the overall increase in our non fabrication revenue from to is mainly attributable to the caspian project entering the drawing stage 
the overall decrease in our non fabrication revenue from to was mainly attributable to the completion of larger projects without the same level of new work to replace them due to clients decreased spending on capital projects 
gross profit of the overall increase in our automation segment s gross profit from to  million is attributable to increased revenue while decreased costs contributed million to the overall increase 
the overall gross profit percentage increase is due to the automation segment becoming more efficient and innovative in providing customer solutions 
of the total gross profit percentage decrease from to  percentage points were attributable to reduced margins due to competitive pressure and increased overhead costs related to expanding our services during the year 
this included the up front costs associated with offering new services

gross profit the overall decrease in our field solutions segment s gross profit from to is primarily due to the segment s overall decrease in revenue 
however  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from to because a smaller portion of the revenues were derived from inspection services which typically has lower margins 
also  margins from inspection services were negatively impacted by payroll changes made in the fourth quarter 
of the overall decrease in our field solutions segment s gross profit from to  million is attributable to increased costs  while decreased revenues contributed to million of the decrease 
of the total gross profit percentage decrease  percentage points was attributable to lower margins resulting from competitive pressures  while the remaining percentage points decrease is attributable to increased non billable and indirect costs resulting from low employee utilization

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources overview the company defines liquidity as its ability to pay liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet monetary contractual obligations 
our primary source of liquidity at december  was borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank the wells fargo credit facility  discussed under senior revolving credit facility below 
cash on hand at december  totaled thousand and availability under the wells fargo credit facility totaled million  after consideration of loan covenant restrictions  resulting in total liquidity of million 
we believe that we have sufficient available cash required for operations for the next months 
however  cash and the availability of cash could be materially restricted if we are unable to extend the senior revolving credit facility past its current end date of may  or obtain alternative sources of financing  amounts billed are not collected or are not collected in a timely manner  circumstances prevent the timely internal processing of invoices  project mix continues to shift from cost reimbursable to fixed price contracts and we are unable to accurately estimate the project costs  resulting in cost overruns  the company loses one or more of its major customers or its major customers significantly reduce the amount of work requested from the company  or acquisitions are not integrated timely or effectively if any such event occurs  we would be forced to consider alternative financing options 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million in net cash in  used million of net cash in  and provided million in net cash in for the year ended december   the changes in working capital were primarily due to increased trade receivables of million  decreased notes receivable of million attributable to a payment received on the alon usa receivable  decreased income taxes receivable of million primarily due to a tax refund received in october  decreased accounts payable of million and decreased accrued compensation and benefits of million 
the increase in trade receivables was primarily the result of increased operating activity 
our days sales outstanding has increased from days for the month period ended december  to days for the month period ended december  the company manages its billing and client collection processes toward reducing days sales outstanding to the extent practicable 
we believe that our allowance for bad debt is adequate to cover any potential non payment by our customers 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used cash totaling million in  compared to million in and million in in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions 
in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the cdi transaction 
in  investing activities were primarily used for capital additions and the pci transaction 
future investing activities are anticipated to remain consistent with prior years and include capital additions for leasehold improvements  technical applications software and equipment  such as upgrades to computers  as well as acquisitions 
the wells fargo credit facility discussed under senior revolving credit facility below limits annual capital expenditures to million and acquisitions require prior approval by wells fargo 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used cash totaling million in  provided cash totaling million in  and used cash totaling million in during  our primary financing mechanism was our line of credit under the wells fargo credit facility 
the line of credit was used principally to finance working capital requirements 
during  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate and we repaid an aggregate of million 
during  our borrowings on the line of credit were million in the aggregate and we repaid an aggregate of million on our short term and long term bank and other debt 
we anticipate that future cash flows from financing activities will be borrowings  payments on the line of credit and payments on long term debt instruments 
line of credit fluctuations are a function of timing related to operations  obligations and payments received on accounts receivable 
we estimate that payments on long term debt  including interest for the coming year  will be million  however  if we are unable to replace the credit facility or if we replace it at unfavorable terms  it could have a negative impact on the cash flows and the operations of the company 
senior revolving credit facility historically  we have satisfied our cash requirements through operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
in december  the company entered into a new credit agreement with wells fargo bank  which provided a month  million senior secured revolving credit facility wells fargo credit facility 
the wells fargo credit facility expires on may  and the company is in the process of obtaining replacement financing 
the wells fargo credit facility is guaranteed by substantially all of the company s subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and positions wells fargo as senior to all other debt 
on september   the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement with wells fargo bank which converted our borrowings from a revolving credit facility to an asset based lending agreement 
on august   the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with wells fargo bank which allows a maximum available principal amount of million under the credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility allows for borrowings limited to an aggregate of of our current eligible accounts receivable 
the wells fargo credit facility is additionally limited by deductions from accounts receivable for items such as invoices past due over days  fixed price work  foreign receivables and government work 
these accounts receivable exclusions under the credit facility totaled million at december  the amended and restated credit facility contains an unused commitment fee of fifty basis points per annum and allows for other indebtedness of up to million to cover the ex im bank credit facility  described in the letters of credit section  and up to million in any month period for the unsecured financing of insurance premiums 
the outstanding balance on the wells fargo credit facility as of december  was million this amount was subject to a fluctuating interest rate described below 
the remaining borrowings available under the wells fargo credit facility as of december  were million after consideration of loan covenant restrictions 
at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the wells fargo credit facility will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be above the daily one month libor rate in effect from time to time 
the company s credit facility requires the company to maintain certain financial covenants as of the end of each calendar quarter  including the following total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not greater than to  and fixed charge coverage ratio not less than to 
total liabilities is defined as the aggregate of current liabilities and non current liabilities 
tangible net worth is defined as the aggregate of total stockholders equity less any intangible assets and less any loans or advances to  or investments in  any related entities or individuals 
fixed charge coverage ratio is determined on a rolling four quarter basis and is defined as ebitda minus cash taxes  divided by interest expense  plus the current maturity of long term debt  where ebitda is net income  plus interest expense  plus income taxes  plus depreciation and amortization  plus stock compensation expense 
the company was not in compliance with one covenant fixed charge ratio under the wells fargo credit facility as of december   however  wells fargo has granted a waiver for the breach of this covenant 
for the quarterly item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued period ended december   our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio ranged from to  and our fixed charge coverage ratio ranged from 
to 
during the month period ended december  we expended or committed approximately  or million  of the million fiscal year covenant limitation on capital expenditures 
the balance of our capital expenditures for the month period has been for normal operating requirements including office furniture  computers  software and vehicles 
the wells fargo credit facility also contains covenants that place certain limitations on the company including limits on capital expenditures  other indebtedness  mergers  asset sales  investments  guaranties  and restrictions on certain distributions and pledges of assets 
the wells fargo credit facility has been extended  with an increased interest rate  to may  and we are currently in the due diligence phase to secure a new  long term credit facility from an different lender 
we presently have competitive proposals from two major financial institutions to provide long term financing on terms that are better than our existing wells fargo credit facility and we are working toward entering into a new credit facility with a multi year term before the may  extension date on our wells fargo credit facility 
if we are unable to do so  we believe alternative forms of financing are available to us 
letters of credit in july  with the support of wells fargo s global banking group  englobal and the export import bank of the united states ex im bank entered into a million letter of credit facility the ex im bank facility to support the company s caspian pipeline consortium cpc project 
under the terms of this agreement  the company may issue letters of credit to cpc for its performance under the cpc project 
the company is required to collateralize letters of credit outstanding under the ex im bank facility with cash or eligible receivables resulting from the cpc project

income tax provision we recognize interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in governmental penalties 
as of december   we have not recognized interest or penalties relating to any uncertain tax positions 
the company is subject to federal and state income tax audits from time to time that could result in proposed assessments 
the company cannot predict with certainty the timing of such audits  how these audits would be resolved and whether the company would be required to make additional tax payments  which may or may not include penalties and interest 
the company is not currently the subject of any examination by the internal revenue service  and the open years subject to audit are tax years for most states where the company conducts business  the company is subject to examination for the preceding three to six years 
asset management item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we typically sell our products and services on short term credit and seek to minimize our credit risk by performing credit checks and conducting our own collection efforts 
our trade accounts receivable increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the number of days sales outstanding for trade accounts receivable increased from days at december   to days at december  bad debt expense was approximately and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts from million to million or and of trade accounts receivable balance for each of the years and  respectively 
we continue to manage this portion of our business very carefully 
risk management in performing services for our clients  we could potentially face liability for breach of contract  personal injury  property damage or negligence  including professional errors and omissions 
we often agree to indemnify our clients for losses and expenses incurred as a result of our negligence and  in certain cases  the sole or concurrent negligence of our clients 
our quality control and assurance program includes a control function to establish standards and procedures for performance and for documentation of project tasks  and an assurance function to audit and to monitor compliance with procedures and quality standards 
we maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and third party property damage  professional errors and omissions  and workers compensation coverage  which we consider sufficient to insure against these risks  subject to self insured amounts 
seasonality our revenues are generated by services  and therefore holidays and employee vacations during our fourth quarter exert downward pressure on revenues for that quarter  which is only partially offset by the year end efforts on the part of many clients to spend any remaining funds budgeted for services and capital expenditures during the year 
our clients annual budget process is normally completed in the first quarter of each calendar year  which can slow the award of new work at the beginning of the year 
principally due to these factors  our first and fourth quarters are typically less robust than our second and third quarters 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition a large portion of the company s revenue is recognized under time and material contracts 
significant estimates are generally not involved in determining revenue recognition for these types of contracts 
significant estimates are involved in determining revenue recognition for fixed price contracts 
most of our contracts are with fortune companies 
as a result  collection risk is generally not a relevant factor in the recognition of revenue 
however  timing of accounts receivable collections could have a serious impact in the company s liquidity 
we have instituted policies to determine the creditworthiness of new customers 
adverse changes in the economy are likely to impact smaller companies ability to undertake and finance projects 
our revenue is largely composed of engineering service revenue and product sales 
the majority of our services are provided through time and material contracts also referred to as cost plus contracts 
some contracts have not to exceed provisions that place a cap on the revenue that we may receive under a particular contract 
the contract is awarded with the maximum aggregate revenue  referred to as the not to exceed amount 
the company does not earn revenue over the not to exceed amount unless we obtain a change order 
the current amount of revenue deferred for these reasons is million 
the company is not obligated to complete the contract once the not to exceed amount has been reached 
however  if the company performs work over the not to exceed amount prior to obtaining a valid change order  our gross profit margins are negatively impacted 
billings on time and material contracts are produced every two weeks 
on occasion  we serve as purchasing agent by procuring subcontractors  material and equipment on behalf of a client and passing the cost on to the client with no mark up or profit 
revenue and cost for these types of purchases are not included in total revenue and cost 
for financial reporting  this pass through type of transaction is reported net 
we item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued had million and million of pass through transactions in and  respectively 
we had no pass through transactions in revenue on fixed price contracts is recorded primarily using the percentage of completion cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue on long term contracts is recognized in the ratio that contract costs incurred bear to total estimated contract costs 
revenue and gross margin on fixed price contracts are subject to revision throughout the lives of the contracts and any required adjustments are made in the period in which the revisions become known 
to manage unknown risks  management uses contingency amounts to increase the estimated costs  therefore  lowering the earned revenues until the risks are better identified and quantified or have been mitigated 
we currently have million in contingency 
losses on contracts are recorded in full as they are identified 
the asset  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed on fixed price contracts 
the company s inability to manage significant levels or increases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts could have a serious impact on the company s cash flow 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated profits on uncompleted contracts represents amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on fixed price contracts 
change orders change orders are modifications of an original contract that effectively change deliverables under a contract without adding new provisions 
we can request change orders  and our clients may initiate them 
change orders may include changes in specifications or design  manner of performance  equipment  materials  scope of work and or the period of completion of the project 
change orders occur when changes are experienced once a contract is begun 
change orders are sometimes documented and in most cases the terms of change orders are agreed upon with the client before the work is performed 
other times  circumstances may require that work progress without the client s written agreement before the work is performed 
in those cases  we are taking a risk that the customer will not sign a change order or at a later time the customer will seek to negotiate the pricing of the additional work 
costs related to change orders are recognized when they are incurred 
change orders are included in the total estimated contract revenue when it is more likely than not that the change orders will result in a bona fide addition to value that can be reliably estimated 
we have a favorable history of negotiating and collecting for work performed under change orders and our bi weekly billing cycle has proven to be timely enough to properly account for change orders 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized and is tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis as of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
reporting units for the purpose of goodwill impairment calculations are components one level below our reportable operating segments for which discreet financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
in step of the goodwill impairment test  the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
in step  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  including goodwill  then the goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to expense 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions  including determination of an appropriate discount rate  projecting revenue growth and gross margins  estimating operating and interest expense and projecting capital expenditure levels  are involved in making these fair value estimates  with the most critical estimates being projected growth rate and discount rate 
the projected growth rate incorporates the company s budget and management s estimate of the long term growth rate of the company based on certain internal estimates and external data 
the discount rate utilized in the analysis was a weighted average cost of capital wacc 
wacc is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise  with the weighting of returns based on the capitalization of comparable companies 
while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow projections and wacc assumptions  actual future cash flows  costs of capital or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment and charges related to recorded goodwill balances 
during  the company realigned its reporting into three business segments 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company further consolidated its legal entities and internal reporting and renamed the reportable segments as engineering and construction  automation and field solutions 
as a result  goodwill that was previously reported in the construction segment which no longer exists as a separate segment was reallocated to engineering and construction and field solutions 
other than the change in reporting segments and reporting units  our methodologies for performing our goodwill impairment analysis have not changed from the prior year 
however  the wacc assumption decreased approximately percentage points for the current year analysis 
the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value in excess of 
deterioration in our expected operating results or increases in our cost of capital could have a negative effect on fair value and lead to an impairment charge in the future 
a decrease in our budgeted short term growth rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering and construction million automation million field solutions million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for any of our reporting units 
a decrease in our projected long term growth rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering and construction million automation million field solutions million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for any of our reporting units 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued a increase in our assumed discount rate holding all other assumptions constant would have the following impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units  summarized by segment engineering and construction million automation million field solutions million these hypothetical changes would not cause step of the goodwill impairment test to be required for the reporting units within any of our segments 
deferred tax the company had net deferred tax asset balances of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
these net deferred tax assets are identified in footnote to the financial statements 
the company had a federal net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately million 
earlier utilization of the net operating loss on the company s and consolidated tax returns was disallowed by the irs which resulted in a reinstated carry forward 
the current year net operating loss of approximately million will be available for carry back to and and for carry forward through the company also has a foreign net operating loss carry forward at december  of approximately million 
this loss is available for utilization from through  however  application of the net operating loss is restricted to the income of englobal canada 
the company is unsure of its ability to fully utilize the foreign net operating loss 
therefore  the company has set up a valuation allowance of million against the net operating loss 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance eliminates the presentation option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
in december  the fasb deferred indefinitely the effective date for a portion of this guidance relating to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the remainder of this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company will adopt this guidance on january  and the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued guidance which gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and  in some cases  bypass the two step impairment test 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company will adopt this guidance on january  and the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial position or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required 
there are no material investments at december  accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its variable rate line of credit debt obligation  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
assuming a increase in the interest rate on this variable rate debt obligation ie  an increase from the actual average interest rate of as of december   to an average interest rate of  annual interest expense would have been approximately item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  higher in based on our annual average line of credit obligation 
due to the current credit market  a greater concern is the impact of a material violation of certain financial covenants in our credit agreement resulting in a re pricing of that agreement 
this could not only result in the increased annual interest expense but also a renewal or origination fee of equal proportion on a similar credit agreement 
the company does not have any interest rate swap or exchange agreements 
the company has no market risk exposure in the areas of interest rate risk from investments because the company did not have an investment portfolio as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  the company does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
transactions in canadian dollars in our former canadian subsidiary have been translated into us dollars using the current rate method  such that assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange during the appropriate fiscal period 
as a result  the carrying value of the company s investments in canada was subject to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations 
additionally  any revenue received from the company s international operations in other than us dollars will be subject to foreign exchange risk 
the percentage of revenue received from foreign customers is identified in the discussion of segment revenue 
most revenue received from foreign customers is paid to the company in u 
s 
currency  except for revenue collected by our former canadian subsidiaries 
the canadian dollar is not subject to volatile price fluctuations compared to the us dollar
