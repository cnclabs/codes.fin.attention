item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data business overview during fiscal  we leveraged our solid contractual positions in traditional end markets of aerospace and igt and gained traction in newer businesses such as aerostructures and oil and gas 
the commercial aerospace market is robust and does not appear to be slowing down 
we are well positioned to benefit from increased base production build rates announced by boeing and airbus  and boeing production is beginning to gain traction 
within our power markets  we experienced solid igt sales growth  driven by both improved oem schedules and aftermarket demand for spares 
we also generated more than billion of cash from operations during fiscal and revenue reached a record level  exceeding billion 
as part of our continued focus on expanding our product lines and markets  we completed eight acquisitions in fiscal the acquisition of the rings operations of unison engine components tru form  which closed in the second quarter of fiscal  broadens our forged product range  adding flash welded and cold rolled rings to our portfolio 
tru form  which supplies all prime engine oems  has exposure to every major commercial aircraft in production today 
the addition of pb fasteners  which closed early in the third quarter of fiscal  further strengthens our fastener product line  adds to our already strong position on the boeing  and will provide opportunities on other composite aircraft in the future 
in addition to our already served end markets  we are rapidly expanding our aerospace reach and positioning ourselves with customers in the oil and gas industry 
aided by the acquisitions of rollmet and klad  we have made great strides in penetrating the oil and gas markets 
we received two significant orders with major oil and gas customers  which will provide incremental sales in fiscal in early fiscal  we acquired rathgibson  llc  which gives us additional manufacturing capabilities to serve the oil and gas industry and will enable us to offer more comprehensive bids on severe service projects 
we also have a strong focus on development of our aerostructures platform 
with the integration of primus actively underway  we have already begun to capture valuable synergies and to achieve top and bottom line growth 
in may  we acquired centra industries centra  a state of the art aerostructures manufacturer located in ontario  canada 
centra manufactures a range of machined airframe components and assemblies  in both aluminum and hard metals 
also in may  we agreed to acquire dickson testing company dickson and aerocraft heat treating company aerocraft 
dickson offers a full range of destructive testing services including mechanical properties  metallurgical and chemical analyses  and low cycle fatigue testing 
aerocraft provides precision heat treating services for titanium and nickel alloy forgings and castings used in the aerospace industry  as well as other related services including straightening  de twisting and forming 
during fiscal  we focused on upgrading manufacturing equipment and increasing operational productivity with the completion or initiation of several large scale cost reduction projects throughout the company 
we also acquired several small strategic tuck in acquisitions that expanded our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal to be moderately higher than fiscal based on our current forecasts 
these expenditures will be targeted for equipment upgrades  capacity expansion  and cost reduction and productivity projects across all segments 
our net periodic pension expense for fiscal is estimated to increase by million  primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses 
however  improved operating performance at every one of our manufacturing sites continues to be our prime focus 
we have achieved strong base incremental margins across all segments over the past year 
over the long term  as a company  we are focused daily on delivering strong incremental margins as our sales increase  as our results have clearly demonstrated over the past year 
we have the right tools  and we have the right people  who know how to put these tools to work to deliver results and the opportunity for both top and bottom line growth has never been better

aerospace sales increased approximately million  or percent  over the prior year driven by higher build rates of commercial aircraft  including the boeing  and the greater frequency of takeoffs and landings 
this segment also experienced solid increases in commercial and military aftermarket sales 
within our power market  igt sales increased by approximately million  or  over the prior year  driven by both oem orders and aftermarket demand 
the increases in aerospace and igt sales were partially offset by declines in general industrial and other sales 
sales also include million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 
operating income for the investment cast products segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal operating income increased compared to the prior year as the segment continues to generate solid incremental margins on increased sales volumes into aerospace and igt markets 
the segment improved operating margin by percentage points year over year driven by the solid drop through on increased volume  partially offset by costs associated with anticipated volume increases  including maintenance and training expenses 
contractual material pass through pricing diluted operating margins by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year 
the investment cast products segment anticipates growing aerospace oem sales driven by the announced increases in airbus and boeing base program build rates in late calendar and early  as well as by production  which will continue to be a strong contributor to segment sales as build schedules ramp through this calendar year and into the next 
on the igt front  oem sales are beginning to trend positively  providing further upside potential 
we estimate that our net periodic pension expense for fiscal will increase by million  primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses 
fiscal compared with fiscal the investment cast products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  an increase of percent from fiscal sales of  million 
the year over year increase in sales reflects the realignment of aerospace oem orders with production rates and aftermarket increases driven by engine schedules 
aerospace sales increased approximately million  or percent  over fiscal as the destocking ended and orders driven by previously announced increases in base aircraft build rates realigned with customer demand 
in addition  external alloy sales from cannon muskegon more than doubled over fiscal  which we believe is a leading indicator of the aerospace rebound 
igt sales decreased approximately million  or percent  compared to fiscal due to continued customer destocking that began in the latter half of fiscal  however  the segment experienced an increase in oem shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales also include million of higher pricing related to contractual pass through of increased material costs compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million 

table of contents operating income for the investment cast products segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal operating income increased compared to fiscal primarily due to improved leverage on increased aerospace throughput combined with improved cost performance

similar to investment cast products  this segment experienced robust oem and aftermarket aerospace activity as aerospace sales improved by approximately million  or percent  year over year 
in addition  sales within our power market increased approximately million  or  compared to the prior year 
factors contributing to this increase include growth in igt sales due to market share gains and oil and gas sales aided by the acquisitions of rollmet and klad  partially offset by a decline in interconnect pipe shipments 
although interconnect pipe sales continued to lag fiscal levels  demand is beginning to improve 
general industrial sales declined approximately million  or  during fiscal  as the segment used more of its internal assets for billet production  with intercompany activity increasing approximately million  or  over last year 
higher external selling prices of external alloy sales from the segment s three primary mills added approximately million to top line revenues in fiscal versus fiscal fiscal sales also include million of contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to million last year  an increase of million 
operating income for the forged products segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the increase in operating income year over year was primarily driven by solid leverage from increased aerospace and igt volume and the contribution from the acquisitions 
the segment s operating margins increased by percentage points year over year despite higher development costs associated with testing and qualifying new oil and gas products 
operationally  the segment achieved strong base incremental drop though and increased internal metal sourcing to reduce costs 
the contractual pass through of higher raw material costs diluted operating margins by percentage points in fiscal compared to percentage points last year 

table of contents the forged products segment is poised for further aerospace growth in fiscal as base commercial aircraft and boeing production schedules begin to build 
we foresee numerous opportunities for sales growth in oil and gas markets in fiscal and going forward 
delivery of the segment s saudi aramco nickel casing order is scheduled to begin late in the first half of fiscal and the adnoc nickel casing order is expected to start shipping in the second quarter of fiscal we expanded our power platform with the acquisition of rathgibson  which closed two days into the first quarter of fiscal rathgibson gives us further manufacturing capabilities to serve the oil and gas industry and will enable us to offer more comprehensive bids on severe service projects going forward

general industrial sales also showed continued strength  increasing by approximately million  or percent  compared to fiscal fiscal also includes four quarters of sales from carlton  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these increases was a decline in power markets of approximately million  or percent  compared to fiscal due to significantly lower core seamless pipe shipments 
higher external selling prices of external alloy sales from the segment s three primary mills added approximately million to top line revenues in fiscal versus fiscal fiscal sales also include million of contractual pricing related to pass through of increased raw material costs compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
operating income for the forged products segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the slight increase in operating income year over year was primarily driven by solid leverage from increased aerospace volume and the contribution from increased general industrial business  partially offset by weak seamless pipe performance 
the segment s operating margin decreased by more than percentage points in fiscal due to the negative impact of reduced seamless pipe volume and pricing 
growth in the segment s lower margin general industrial markets also negatively impacted operating margin

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent increase from fiscal sales of  million 
fiscal results include the contribution from the primus and pb fasteners acquisitions for part of the year 
this segment experienced a solid recovery in aerospace sales compared to the prior year  which increased approximately million  or percent  driven by a steady acceleration in orders for the segment s critical aerospace core fastener products and the contribution from acquisitions 
while the gap between order levels and commercial aircraft production rates continued to close  the segment still lagged the build rates as customer inventory levels continued to be depleted 
in terms of the aerostructure products within the segment  sales are tracking closely to increased commercial build rates 
general industrial sales increased approximately million  or  over the prior year 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal the increased volume of core product running through the fastener products businesses is starting to drive solid incremental drop through  however  operating margins were reduced by percentage points due to the inclusion of lower margin sales from the acquisitions in fiscal results 
although the acquisitions continue to have a dilutive effect on segment operating margins  they are quickly adopting pcc operational methods and are beginning to demonstrate solid performance improvements 
the fastener products segment is expected to benefit when boeing production schedules accelerate and core aerospace product sales recover  although  there is no current line of sight related to the timing of these items 
we also expanded our presence in the aerostructures business with the acquisition of centra industries in the first quarter of fiscal aerostructures will continue to be a platform for our long term profitable growth 
we estimate that our net periodic pension expense for fiscal will increase by million  primarily due to a reduction in discount rates and amortization of actuarial losses 
fiscal compared with fiscal the fastener products segment reported fiscal sales of  million  a percent increase from fiscal sales of  million 
strong general industrial sales helped to increase year over year sales by approximately million  or percent 
offsetting this increase was a decline in aerospace fastener sales of approximately million  or percent  compared to fiscal aerospace volume suffered from delays in the boeing production schedule and continued weakness in orders from distributors  as current aircraft production was supplied out of existing customer inventory 
this segment was able to increase sales of lower margin  non core aerospace products in order to maintain volume and mitigate the impact of the decline in core aerospace sales 
operating income for the fasteners segment was million or percent of sales in fiscal  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal segment operating margins were negatively affected by the shift away from core aerospace products to lower margin  less complex fasteners  and increased general industrial volume 
interest and taxes net interest expense during fiscal was million  compared with million during fiscal the reduced interest expense was primarily due to lower debt balances  partially offset by a make whole prepayment of interest associated with the early retirement of our remaining outstanding private note 
the private note was repaid in november in advance of its august stated maturity 
interest income increased as a result of an increase in cash balances invested outside the us earning rates higher than us interest rates 
net interest expense in fiscal was million  compared with million in fiscal the lower net interest expense was primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from lower debt balances and lower borrowing rates  and increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  percentage points lower than the percent effective tax rate in fiscal the decrease in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to a reduction in state taxes  increased benefits from earnings taxed at rates lower than the u 
s statutory tax rate  and benefits from non recurring adjustments to prior year tax assets and liabilities  partially offset by reduced benefits from the research and development credit 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent  percentage points lower than the percent effective tax rate in fiscal the decrease in the full year tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased benefits from the federal manufacturing deduction and a reduction in non benefited foreign losses  partially offset by reduced benefits from earnings taxed at rates lower than the u 
s statutory tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources total assets of  million at april  represented a  million increase from the  million balance at april  the increase principally reflects cash generated during the year from business operations totaling  million and increased receivables in support of higher sales 
inventories also increased driven by purchases to support increasing sales  increasing internal metal and product sourcing  and an inventory build in anticipation of maintenance scheduled in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  tangible and intangible assets recorded in the acquisitions of rollmet  tru form  primus and pb fasteners contributed to the increase 
total capitalization at april  was  million  consisting of million of debt and  million of equity 
the debt to capitalization ratio declined to at april  from at the end of fiscal  reflecting debt reductions and the impact of increased equity from earnings and stock issuances through employee stock compensation programs  partially offset by an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our pension and other postretirement plans 
cash as of april  was million  a decrease of million from the end of fiscal  and total debt was million  down million since the end of fiscal the net negative cash flow reflects cash paid to acquire businesses net of cash acquired of  million and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by cash generated from operations of  million and million from the issuance of common stock 
capital spending of million in fiscal principally provided for cost reduction and productivity projects and equipment upgrades throughout the company 
we expect our baseline capital expenditures for fiscal to be moderately higher than fiscal based on our current forecasts 
these expenditures will be targeted for equipment upgrades  capacity expansion  and cost reduction and productivity projects across all segments 
during fiscal  we contributed million to the defined benefit pension plans  of which million was voluntary 
in the first month of fiscal  we made an additional million voluntary contribution to the defined benefit pension plans 
we expect to contribute approximately million of required contributions in fiscal  for total contributions to the defined benefit pension plans of approximately million in fiscal in addition  we contributed million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal we expect to contribute approximately million to the other postretirement benefit plans during fiscal in july  we paid million to one of our postretirement medical benefit plans that was jointly administered with a union 
this payment and the related administrative changes remove pcc and its affiliates from any further financial  administrative or fiduciary responsibilities to this plan  and we therefore accounted for these events as a settlement of the plan and reversed the related liability 
there was no significant gain or loss associated with the settlement 
during fiscal  we closed on eight acquisitions in the amount of  million 
these acquisitions were funded from cash on hand and the proceeds from commercial paper debt issuances  which was repaid prior to the end of the third quarter of fiscal historically  we have issued commercial paper as a method of raising short term liquidity 
we believe we continue to have the ability to issue commercial paper and have issued commercial paper to cover acquisitions and short term cash requirements in recent quarters 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of april  or april  during fiscal  the average amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
during fiscal  the average amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding was million and the weighted average interest rate was 
during fiscal and  the largest daily balance of outstanding commercial paper borrowings was million and million  respectively 
we do not anticipate any changes in our ability to borrow under our current credit facility  but changes in the financial condition of the participating financial institutions could negatively impact our ability to borrow funds in the future 
should that circumstance arise  we believe that we would be able to arrange any needed financing  although we are not able to predict what the terms of any such borrowings would be  or the source of the borrowed funds 
on november   we entered into a credit agreement the new credit agreement with bank of america  na as administrative agent  swing line lender and l c issuer  wells fargo bank  national association and citibank  na  as syndication agents  and other lenders from time to time party thereto collectively the lenders 
on the same day  we also terminated our prior credit agreement with bank of america  na and the other lenders under such agreement 
the new credit agreement consists of a five year  billion revolving credit facility with a million increase option  subject to approval of the lenders maturing november   unless extended pursuant to two day extension options subject to approval of the lenders 
the new credit agreement is unsecured and contains customary representations and warranties  events of default  and financial and other covenants 

table of contents our unused borrowing capacity as of april  was billion under the new credit agreement 
our financial covenant requirement and actual ratio as of april  was as follows covenant requirement actual consolidated leverage ratio maximum terms are defined in the new credit agreement 
as of april   we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the new credit agreement 
we believe we will be able to meet our short and longer term liquidity needs for working capital  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  capital spending  cash dividends  scheduled repayment of debt and potential acquisitions with the cash generated from operations  borrowing from our billion revolving credit facility or new bank credit facilities  the issuance of public or privately placed debt securities  or the issuance of equity instruments 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and lease agreements 
the following table represents our contractual payment obligations as of april  and the estimated timing of future cash payments contractual cash obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases cash contributions to qualified pension plans interest on fixed rate debt interest on variable rate debt total operating lease obligations include million attributable to operations held for sale 
interest on variable rate debt is based on current prevailing interest rates 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions at april  was million 
due to the uncertainties associated with settling these liabilities  we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these liabilities 
as a result  our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is excluded from the table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
we also have benefit payments due under our non qualified pension and other post retirement benefit plans that are not required to be funded in advance  but are pay as you go 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
note that the preparation of this annual report requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the contract or purchase order  ownership and risk of loss have passed to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured  and pricing is fixed and determinable 
in instances where title does not pass to the customer 
table of contents upon shipment  we recognize revenue upon delivery or customer acceptance  depending on terms of the sales agreement 
service sales  representing maintenance and engineering activities  are recognized as services are performed 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in revenue 
valuation of inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of their cost or market value  with the market value being determined based on sales in the ordinary course of business 
cost for inventories at a significant number of our operations is determined on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the average inventory cost method is utilized for most other inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on the age  historical usage or assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
we also regularly review inventory balances on a lifo basis to ensure the balances are stated at the lower of cost or market as of the balance sheet date 
for those inventories valued using lifo  their carrying value may be higher or lower than current replacement costs for such inventory  since the lifo costing assumption matches current costs with current sales  not with current inventory values 
when the lifo cost is greater than the current cost  there is an increased likelihood that our inventories could be subject to write downs to market value 
while historical write downs have not been material  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and reported operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangibles from time to time  we acquire businesses in purchase transactions that typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to our continuing operations are tested for impairment at a minimum each fiscal year at the end of the second month in the second quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets exceeds their fair value 
for fiscal  our reporting units consisted of two operating segments within our investment cast products reportable operating segment  two operating segments within our forged products reportable operating segment  as well as four reporting units in our fastener products reportable operating segment 
pcc aerostructures  which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal  will be tested for goodwill impairment in fiscal the fastener products operating segment includes several aggregated component units referred to as the fastener products reporting unit  pcc aerostructures  and two other reporting units 
testing for goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations 
such models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions primarily based on future cash flows  expected market growth rates  our estimates of sales volumes  sales prices and related costs  and the discount rate applied  which reflects the weighted average cost of capital 
management uses the best available information at the time fair values of the reporting units are estimated  however  estimates could be materially impacted by factors such as changes in growth trends and specific industry conditions  with the potential for a corresponding adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements potentially resulting from an impairment of the goodwill 
we also consider comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the cash flow models used to determine fair value are most sensitive to the expected future cash flows and the discount rate for each reporting unit 
the discount rate used in the cash flow models for the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis ranged from to depending on the reporting unit 
the annual growth rate for earnings before interest and taxes varied by reporting unit and ranged from to over the initial five year forecast period 
a sensitivity analysis determined that using terminal growth rates of  or would not result in impairment in the fiscal goodwill impairment analysis 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on both of these factors and determined that the forecast for future earnings before interest and taxes used in the cash flow model could decrease by or the discount rate utilized could increase by  and the goodwill of our reporting units would not be impaired 
the reporting unit that would be most sensitive to worsening economic conditions has million of goodwill recorded as of april  the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  impairment is recorded 
for fiscal and  it was determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets was greater than the carrying value 
environmental costs the estimated future costs for known environmental remediation requirements are accrued on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of remediation costs can be reasonably estimated 
when 
table of contents only a range of amounts is established  and no amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when collection is probable 
adjustments to our accruals may be necessary to reflect new information as investigation and remediation efforts proceed 
the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period  but any amounts  and the possible range of any amounts in excess of those already accrued  are not reasonably estimable at this time 
total environmental liabilities accrued at april  and april  were million and million  respectively 
guidance on asset retirement and environmental obligations clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
asset retirement obligations covered by this guidance include those for which an entity has a significant obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may not be within the control of the entity 
this guidance also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
in accordance with the asset retirement and environmental obligations guidance  we record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability can be reasonably estimated 
currently  we have identified known asset retirement obligations associated with environmental contamination at two of our manufacturing facilities 
however  we have not recognized a liability under this guidance for these retirement obligations because the fair value of remediation at these sites cannot be reasonably estimated since the settlement date is unknown at this time 
the settlement date is unknown because remediation of these sites is not required until production ceases  and we have no current plans to cease production 
these asset retirement obligations  when estimable  are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or business 
income taxes provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pre tax earnings based on current tax law and also include  in the current period  the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities 
the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans we sponsor many us and us defined benefit pension plans 
our pension and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans accounting guidance 
plan assets have been valued at fair value in accordance with this guidance 
pension and postretirement expense and liability amounts are derived from several significant assumptions  including the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rate 
for valuation of our pension liabilities  we derive a market based discount rate from yields on high quality  liquid fixed income securities at the end of our fiscal year 
we use only highly rated bonds aa aa or higher to estimate the interest rate at which our pension benefits could be effectively settled 
for our us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our april  measurement date 
for our non us plans  we used a discount rate assumption of for the total benefit obligation of our pension plans at our april  measurement date 
in developing the long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate input from third party investment consultants and actuaries  review asset allocation and investment strategies  ranges of projected and historical returns  and inflation and economic assumptions 
the expected return assumptions are derived from asset allocations within the company s target asset allocation ranges consistent with our diversified investment approach 
as the assumed rate of return on plan assets is a long term assumption  it is not anticipated to be as volatile as the discount rate  which is a point in time measurement 
for our us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for our non us plans  we used a long term rate of return assumption of to calculate the and net periodic pension cost 
for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense was million and non us net periodic pension income was million 
we estimate that for fiscal  our us net periodic pension expense will be approximately million and non us net periodic pension expense will be approximately million 
the increase in estimated expense is 
table of contents primarily due to a reduction in the discount rates used in determining the net periodic pension cost and amortization of actuarial losses 
absent increases in interest rates  higher asset values and or higher contributions  net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years 
our us net postretirement benefit cost was million for fiscal  and we estimate that for fiscal  our us net postretirement benefit cost will be million 
the table below quantifies the approximate impact  as of april   of a one quarter percentage point decrease in our assumptions for discount rate and expected return on assets  holding other assumptions constant 
percentage point decrease increase in annual costs discount rate expected long term rate of return increase in projected benefit obligation discount rate the approximate impact  as of april   of a one percentage point increase in our assumption for the health care cost trend rate  holding other assumptions constant  on our total service and interest cost components and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation is not significant 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance increasing disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities 
for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities  the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts  amounts offset on the balance sheet  and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective for the company beginning the first quarter of fiscal and is to be applied retrospectively 
as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
in december  the fasb deferred some aspects of the june guidance that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments 
the fasb is considering whether to present the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements 
the guidance is effective for the company beginning the first quarter of fiscal and is to be applied retrospectively 
the company is currently evaluating how it will report comprehensive income  but either method permitted will constitute a change in the company s financial statement presentation 
in september  the fasb issued guidance to aid in an entity s assessment of goodwill and whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this guidance  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
this pronouncement will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal as this guidance only modifies the requirements of impairment testing  the adoption will not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb also issued guidance that increases the quantitative and qualitative disclosures an employer is required to provide about its participation in significant multiemployer plans that offer pension or other postretirement benefits 
the objective of this guidance is to enhance the transparency of disclosures about the significant multiemployer plans in which an employer participates  the level of the employer s participation in those plans  the financial health of the plans  and the nature of the employer s commitments to the plans 
this pronouncement has been adopted and disclosure is included within note pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

table of contents in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires certain disclosures and clarifies existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require disclosure of transfers into and out of level and level as defined in the accounting guidance fair value measurements  and also require more detailed disclosure about the activity within level fair value measurements 
this guidance was effective for the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal  except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which was effective in the first quarter of fiscal as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements

this guidance was effective in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at various times  we use derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and prices of strategic raw materials 
because derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  fluctuations in the market values of such derivative instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the underlying economic exposures that the instruments are intended to hedge
