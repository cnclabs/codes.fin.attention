item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we own and operate three interstate natural gas pipeline systems  including integrated storage facilities 
our pipeline systems originate in the gulf coast region  oklahoma and arkansas  and extend northeasterly to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana and ohio 
our pipeline systems contain approximately  miles of interconnected pipelines  directly serving customers in twelve states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern us through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
in  our pipeline systems transported approximately tcf of gas 
average daily throughput on our pipeline systems during was approximately bcf 
our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of eleven underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately bcf 
we conduct all of our natural gas transportation and integrated storage operations through our operating subsidiaries as one segment 
our transportation services consist of firm transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported  and interruptible transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used 
we offer firm storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas other than for system management purposes  but changes in the level of natural gas prices may impact the volumes of gas transported on our pipeline systems 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at our compressor stations  which is included in fuel and gas transportation expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
recent developments in december  hp storage  a joint venture between us and bphc of which we own a interest  acquired petal and hattiesburg and related entities for million 
petal and hattiesburg own seven high deliverability salt dome natural gas storage caverns and related assets in forrest county  mississippi 
the storage caverns have approximately bcf of total storage capacity  of which approximately bcf is working gas capacity 
the other assets include a leaching plant  freshwater and brine disposal wells  approximately  horsepower of compression and approximately miles of pipeline which connect the storage facilities with several major natural gas pipelines  including our gulf south pipeline 
we operate the assets of hp storage on behalf of the joint venture 
hp storage is in the process of leaching a new salt dome storage cavern which will add approximately bcf of working gas capacity and is expected to be placed in service in the first quarter in late and early  we transferred miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to boardwalk field services 
these facilities were modified so that condensate rich eagle ford shale gas can be accepted into the pipeline 
in february  field services entered into a definitive agreement to construct a cryogenic gas processing plant and approximately miles of gathering pipeline to serve producers in the eagle ford shale producing area 
this project is supported by long term  fee based gathering and processing agreements with statoil natural gas llc and talisman energy usa  inc in october  field services and southwestern energy production company executed a fifteen year definitive gas gathering agreement which will require construction of high pressure gas pipeline  a low pressure gathering pipeline  compression and dehydration assets in susquehanna and lackawanna counties  pennsylvania 
refer to item for further discussion of these projects 
market conditions and contract renewals the majority of our revenues are derived from capacity reservation charges under firm agreements that are not impacted by the volume of natural gas transported or stored  and a smaller portion of our revenues are derived from charges based on actual volumes transported under firm and interruptible services 
for example  for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from capacity reservation charges and of our revenues were derived from charges based on actual volumes transported or stored 
as of december   a substantial portion of our transportation capacity has been contracted for under firm agreements having a weighted average remaining life of approximately years 
however  an important aspect of our business is our ability to market available short term firm or interruptible transportation capacity and renew existing longer term transportation contracts 
we actively market our available capacity which includes reserved capacity not fully utilized 
the revenues we will be able to earn from that available capacity and from renewals of expiring contracts will be influenced by basis spreads and other factors discussed below 
our ability to market available transportation capacity is impacted by supply and demand for natural gas  competition from other pipelines  natural gas price volatility  the price differential between physical locations on our pipeline systems basis spreads  economic conditions and other factors 
over the past several years  new sources of natural gas have been identified throughout the us and new pipeline infrastructure has been developed  which has led to changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas and an overall weakening of basis spreads across our pipeline systems 
the narrowing of basis spreads on our pipeline systems has made it more difficult to renew expiring long term firm transportation contracts at previously contracted rates because  as basis spreads decrease  the rates customers are willing to pay decrease 
in addition  as rates decline customers typically seek longer term agreements while we generally seek shorter terms 
changing basis spreads do not have as significant or immediate of an impact on long term firm agreements as they do on short term or interruptible services because long term agreements are also influenced by other factors  such as baseload supply needs  certainty of delivery  predictability of long term costs  the ability to manage those costs through the capacity release mechanism and the terms of service 
the changes in the pricing dynamics and weakening of basis spreads have contributed to decreases in our operating profitability especially with regard to short term and interruptible services 
however  in  revenues from power customers increased and we continue to see additional interest from this customer group 
our ability to market available storage capacity and pal is impacted by many of the factors indicated above  as well as natural gas price differentials between time periods  such as winter to summer time period price spreads 
these time period price spreads have declined over the to periods and have resulted in a significant reduction in our pal and interruptible storage revenues in as compared to pipeline system maintenance we incur substantial costs for ongoing maintenance of our pipeline systems and related facilities  some of which reflect increased regulatory requirements applicable to all interstate pipelines 
these costs include those incurred for pipeline integrity management activities  equipment overhauls  general upkeep and repairs 
phmsa has developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas 
a recently enacted pipeline safety bill could result in increased regulatory requirements 
in  we expect to incur costs of approximately million to maintain our pipeline systems  of which approximately million is expected to be recorded as maintenance capital 
in  these costs were approximately million  of which approximately million was recorded as maintenance capital  excluding the capital costs incurred for repairs associated with a fire at our carthage compressor station 
the projected increase of million is primarily related to pipeline integrity projects and general pipeline maintenance and repairs which are necessary to comply with regulatory requirements 
results of operations compared with our net income for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net income was a result of a charge related to our materials and supplies  decreased pal and storage revenues  increased operations and maintenance expenses and a loss on the early extinguishment of debt 
these unfavorable impacts to net income were partially offset by higher gas transportation revenues from increased capacities 
operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million primarily from increased capacities resulting from the completion of several compression projects in and operating our fayetteville lateral at its design capacity 
pal and storage revenues decreased million due to decreased parking opportunities from unfavorable natural gas price spreads between time periods and fuel retained decreased million primarily due to lower natural gas prices 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  in  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to materials and supplies  most of which was subsequently sold 
operation and maintenance expenses increased by million primarily due to maintenance projects for pipeline integrity management and reliability spending and lower amounts of labor capitalized from fewer growth projects 
other drivers for the increased operating expenses were higher depreciation and property taxes of million associated with an increase in our asset base and reduced gains from the sale of storage gas needed to support operations of million 
these increases were partially offset by lower fuel consumed of million primarily due to lower natural gas prices 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period  driven by a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and higher interest expense of million resulting from higher average interest rates on our long term debt and lower capitalized interest 
compared with our net income for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers were higher transportation revenues from our pipeline expansion projects and gains on gas sales associated with our western kentucky storage expansion project and a reduction in storage gas needed to support no notice services  partially offset by increased operating expenses related to higher depreciation and property taxes associated with the pipeline expansion projects and increased interest expense 
in  gas transportation revenues and throughput were negatively impacted due to operating our pipeline expansion projects at reduced operating pressures and portions of the pipeline expansion projects being shut down for periods of time following the discovery and remediation of anomalies in certain joints of pipe 
operating revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to  million  compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million and fuel retained increased million primarily due to our pipeline expansion projects 
the increases were partially offset by million of lower interruptible and short term firm transportation services resulting from lower basis spreads between delivery points on our pipeline systems 
pal and storage revenues decreased million due to decreased parking opportunities from unfavorable natural gas price spreads between time periods 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers of the increase were increased fuel consumed of million from our pipeline expansion projects and higher natural gas prices 
depreciation and property taxes increased by million associated with an increase in our asset base 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million primarily due to an increase in major maintenance projects 
impairment losses of million were recognized in primarily related to the sale of assets in the overton field area in northeast texas and a portion of pipe materials which we expect to dispose of by sale 
the increased expenses were partly offset by a million gain from the sale of gas related to our western kentucky storage expansion project and a reduction in storage gas needed to support no notice services 
the period was unfavorably impacted by million as a result of pipeline investigation and retirement costs related to the east texas pipeline 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period  driven by higher interest expense of million resulting from increased debt levels in and lower capitalized interest due to the completion of our pipeline expansion projects 
liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities  our revolving credit facility  debt issuances and sales of limited partner units 
our operating subsidiaries use cash from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital requirements  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under our revolving credit facility to service outstanding indebtedness and make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
we have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties 
capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended december   and were million million and million 
growth capital expenditures  including costs associated with our recently completed pipeline expansion projects  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and we expect our maintenance capital expenditures to be approximately million  million of which is for system maintenance primarily related to pipeline integrity management 
our more significant growth projects for are discussed above in recent developments and consist of south texas eagle ford expansion we expect to spend approximately million to construct a gathering pipeline and a cryogenic processing plant in south texas  of which we expect to spend approximately million in marcellus gathering system we expect to spend approximately million to construct a gathering pipeline in pennsylvania  of which we expect to spend approximately million in hp storage hp storage expects to spend approximately million to leach a new salt dome storage cavern which will add working gas capacity of approximately bcf  all of which is expected to be spent in we currently own a equity interest in hp storage 
if it makes economic sense for us and bphc  we could seek to acquire the remaining equity interest in hp storage that we do not currently own 
neither we nor bphc is under any obligation with respect to such a transaction 
refer to item for further discussion of these projects 
equity and debt financing we may seek to access the capital markets to fund some or all of the growth capital expenditures described above 
in addition  we have the following indebtedness maturing over the next months which we expect to refinance through capital market transactions or bank loans i our revolving credit facility matures in june  however all revolving loans outstanding at maturity may  at our election  be converted to term loans which mature in june  ii million of senior unsecured gulf south notes mature in august  and iii our million subordinated loan from bphc matures in december  but is extendable by us for up to a year if we extend the term on our revolving credit facility 
our ability to access the capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on our financial condition  credit ratings and market conditions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  including our revolving credit facility  and future cash flows will be adequate to fund our operations  including our maintenance capital expenditures 
we expect to issue and sell debt and or equity securities and to incur other indebtedness for the purposes described above and may also do so for general corporate purposes  or to fund potential acquisitions and new growth opportunities 
in february  we completed a public offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which increased our available borrowing capacity under the facility 
in january  we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting initial purchaser discounts and offering expenses of million from the sale of million of senior unsecured notes of texas gas due february  notes 
in june  we issued an additional million of the notes 
the additional issuance was priced at a premium resulting in net proceeds of million after deducting underwriter discounts and offering expenses of million 
we used the proceeds from both offerings to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and redeem texas gas notes due april  notes for which we paid premiums of million 
note in item of this report contains more information about the notes and redemption of the notes 
in june  we completed a public offering of million of our common units at a price of per unit 
we received net cash proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses of million and including a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility we maintain a revolving credit facility which has aggregate lending commitments of million  under which boardwalk pipelines  gulf south and texas gas each may borrow funds  up to applicable sub limits 
interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the london interbank offered rate or a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of june   however all outstanding revolving loans on such date may be converted to term loans having a maturity date of june  as of december   we had million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of and no letters of credit issued thereunder 
subsequent to december   we repaid million of borrowings  which decreased borrowings to million  resulting in available borrowing capacity of million 
our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants  including  among others  limitations on the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional debt  sale leaseback transactions and transactions with our affiliates 
the facility also contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  measured for the preceding twelve months  of not more than five to one 
we and our subsidiaries were in compliance with all covenant requirements under our credit facility at december  although we do not believe that these covenants have had  or will have  a material impact on our business and financing activities or our ability to obtain the financing to maintain operations and continue our capital investments  they could restrict us in some circumstances as stated in item a  risk factors 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations under firm commitments as of december   by period in millions total less than year years years more than years principal payments on long term debt interest on long term debt capital commitments pipeline capacity agreements operating lease commitments total includes our senior unsecured notes  having maturity dates from to  million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility  having a maturity date of june   and our subordinated loans which mature initially on december  amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are extendable by us for an additional year and the maturity date of the subordinated loans may be extended by a year if we elect to extend the term of the revolving credit facility 
we have reflected the million of gulf south notes due august gulf south notes as due in less than one year 
the gulf south notes are included in long term debt on our balance sheet  because we expect to refinance these notes on a long term basis and we have sufficient available capacity under our revolving credit facility to extend the amount that would otherwise come due in less than one year 
interest obligations represent interest due on our senior unsecured notes at fixed rates 
future interest obligations under our revolving credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate and fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december   million would be due under the credit facility in less than one year 
capital commitments represent binding commitments under purchase orders for materials ordered but not received and firm commitments under binding construction service agreements existing at december  the amounts shown are associated with various pipeline capacity agreements on third party pipelines that allow our operating subsidiaries to transport gas to off system markets on behalf of our customers 
pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
in  we expect to fund approximately million to the texas gas pension plan 
distributions for the twelve months ended december   and  we paid distributions of million  million and million to our partners 
note in item of this report contains further discussion regarding our distributions 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to a decrease in net income  excluding the non cash materials and supplies impairment charge 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period 
the decrease was driven by an million decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to compression projects which were completed in the decrease was partly offset by uses of cash which included million of contributions related to our interest in hp storage 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash used in financing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period 
the increase in cash used in financing activities resulted from net repayments of million of long term debt  including net repayments under our revolving credit facility  a million premium paid on the early extinguishment of long term debt and a million increase in distributions to our partners 
the increase in the use of cash was partly offset by a million increase in proceeds from the issuance and sale of equity  including related general partner contributions  and million of payments made under our registration rights agreement in impact of inflation the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our property  plant and equipment and materials and supplies is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable unless a rate case is filed 
however  cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to price jurisdictional services to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
regulation our subsidiaries are regulated by ferc 
pursuant to ferc regulations certain revenues that we collect may be subject to possible refunds to our customers 
accordingly  during an open rate case  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded based on regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
at december  and  there were no liabilities for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  neither gulf south nor texas gas is involved in an open general rate case  however gulf crossing filed a cost and revenue study to justify its initial firm transportation rates in january the outcome of this filing is not expected to have a material impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
when certain criteria are met  gaap requires that certain rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates regulatory accounting 
this basis of accounting is applicable to operations of our texas gas subsidiary which records certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods  but is not applicable to operations associated with the fayetteville and greenville laterals due to rates charged under negotiated rate agreements and a portion of the storage capacity due to the regulatory treatment associated with the rates charged for that capacity 
regulatory accounting is not applicable to gulf crossing due to discounts under negotiated rate agreements  or gulf south because competition in the market areas of gulf south has resulted in discounts from the maximum allowable cost based rates being granted to customers and certain services provided by gulf south are priced using market based rates 
we monitor the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate to determine that any regulatory assets continue to be probable of recovery 
if we were to determine that all or a portion of our regulatory assets no longer met the criteria for recognition as regulatory assets  that portion which was not recoverable would be written off  net of any regulatory liabilities 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
in the course of providing transportation and storage services to customers  the pipelines may receive different quantities of gas from shippers and operators than the quantities delivered by the pipelines on behalf of those shippers and operators 
this results in transportation and exchange gas receivables and payables  commonly known as imbalances  which are primarily settled in cash or the receipt or delivery of gas in the future 
settlement of imbalances requires agreement between the pipelines and shippers or operators as to allocations of volumes to specific transportation contracts and timing of delivery of gas based on operational conditions 
the receivables and payables are valued at market price for operations where regulatory accounting is not applicable and are valued at the historical value of gas in storage for operations where regulatory accounting is applicable  consistent with the regulatory treatment 
fair value measurements fair value refers to an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal market in which the reporting entity transacts based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability assuming its highest and best use 
a fair value hierarchy has been established that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions giving priority  from highest to lowest  to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  observable inputs not included in level  for example  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities level  and unobservable data level  for example  a reporting entity s own internal data based on the best information available in the circumstances 
our financial statements and certain disclosures include fair value measurements 
notes    and contain more information regarding our fair value measurements 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and operating personnel and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the epa  ferc and other governmental authorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated environmental costs 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our environmental liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether the carrying amount of long lived assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
this evaluation is based on undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding impairments we have recognized 
goodwill in september  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu  which amended the rules for testing goodwill for impairment 
under the new rules  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in accordance with new gaap requirements  beginning in  we have elected to perform a qualitative assessment on an annual basis to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if indications are that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  a quantitative analysis is performed to measure whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount an additional step is taken to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
as of december   we assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit associated with our goodwill was less than its carrying amount 
we concluded that more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit associated with our goodwill was not less than its carrying amount 
accordingly  the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was not performed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded during no impairment of goodwill was recorded during or our qualitative included an analysis of factors requiring estimates and judgments 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could substantially change the results of the assessment  requiring a quantitative test to be performed and potentially result in the recognition of an impairment charge in our financial statements 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension and postretirement benefit costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the us such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on obligations and related expense associated with these plans 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the moody s aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplement our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve is applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve is developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody s investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk with the exception of our revolving credit facility  for which the interest rate is periodically reset  our debt has been issued at fixed rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the debt instruments but do not directly affect earnings or cash flows 
the following table presents market risk associated with our fixed rate long term debt  including our subordinated loans  at december in millions  except interest rates carrying value of fixed rate debt fair value of fixed rate debt basis point increase in interest rates and resulting debt decrease basis point decrease in interest rates and resulting debt increase weighted average interest rate  including subordinated loan at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of which rate is reset periodically 
a increase in interest rates would increase our cash payments for interest on the credit facility by million on an annualized basis 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
a significant portion of our debt  including our revolving credit facility  will mature over the next five years 
we expect to refinance the debt either prior to or at maturity 
our ability to refinance the debt at interest rates that are currently available is subject to risk at the magnitude illustrated in the table 
we expect to refinance the remainder of our debt that will mature based on our assessment of the term rates of interest available in the market 
at december  and  million and million of our undistributed cash  shown on the balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents  was primarily invested in treasury fund accounts 
due to the short term nature of the treasury fund accounts  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
commodity risk our pipelines do not take title to the natural gas which they transport and store in rendering firm and interruptible transportation and storage services  therefore they do not assume the related natural gas commodity price risk associated with that gas 
however  certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december  and  approximately million and million of gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  was available for sale and exposed to commodity price risk 
additionally  at december   we had bcf of gas with a book value of million that had become available for sale as a result of a change in the storage working gas needed to support operations and no notice services at our texas gas subsidiary 
we often utilize derivatives to hedge certain exposures to market price fluctuations on the anticipated operational sales of gas  however  at december   we had no outstanding derivatives 
subsequent to december   we hedged approximately bcf of anticipated future sales of natural gas and cash for fuel reimbursement 
the derivatives qualify for cash flow hedge accounting and are designated as such 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time our existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to renewal or marketing 
we actively monitor future expiration dates associated with our contract portfolio 
the revenue we will be able to earn from renewals of expiring contracts will be influenced by basis spreads and other factors discussed below 
we compete with numerous interstate and intrastate pipelines 
our ability to market available transportation capacity is impacted by supply and demand for natural gas  competition from other pipelines  natural gas price volatility  the price differential between physical locations on our pipeline systems basis spreads  economic conditions and other factors 
over the past several years  new sources of natural gas have been identified throughout the us and new pipeline infrastructure has been developed which has led to changes in pricing dynamics between supply basins  pooling points and market areas and an overall weakening of basis spreads across our pipeline systems 
the narrowing of basis spreads on our pipeline systems has made it more difficult to renew expiring long term firm transportation contracts at previously contracted rates because  as basis spreads decrease  the rates customers are willing to pay decrease 
in addition  as rates decline customers typically seek longer term agreements while we generally seek shorter terms 
changing basis spreads do not have as significant or immediate impacts on long term firm agreements as they do on short term or interruptible services because long term agreements are also influenced by other factors  such as baseload supply needs  certainty of delivery  predictability of long term costs  the ability to manage those costs through the capacity release mechanism and the terms of service 
the changes in the pricing dynamics and weakening of basis spreads have contributed to decreases in our operating profitability  especially with regard to short term and interruptible services 
however  in  revenues from power customers increased and we continue to see additional interest from this customer group  especially as power producers increase their reliance on natural gas 
credit risk our credit exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and no notice services 
natural gas price volatility can materially increase credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per million british thermal units mmbtu  the market value of that gas was approximately million 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
although nearly all of our customers pay for our services on a timely basis  we actively monitor the credit exposure to our customers 
we include in our ongoing assessments amounts due pursuant to services we render plus the value of any gas we have lent to a customer through no notice or pal services and the value of gas due to us under a transportation imbalance 
our pipeline tariffs contain language that allow us to require a customer that does not meet certain credit criteria to provide cash collateral  post a letter of credit or provide a guarantee from a credit worthy entity in an amount equaling up to three months of capacity reservation charges 
for certain agreements  we have included contractual provisions that require additional credit support should the credit ratings of those customers fall below investment grade
