our selected historical consolidated financial data has been derived from our audited financial statements for the years ending january   january   january   december   and december  rents and royalties revenues consist of a royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchised restaurant sales  and b rents  which consist of base rent and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us rents typically range from to of gross franchised restaurant sales 
franchised restaurant sales are reported to us by our restaurant owners 
the reported franchised restaurant sales for the last years were fiscal years in thousands franchised restaurant sales canada canadian dollars us us dollars the net asset impairment charge of million in fiscal included an asset impairment charge of million  net of a million recovery of previously accrued closure costs 
in fiscal  we impaired our portland  providence and hartford markets 
in addition  we closed restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets and restaurants in our portland market  in fiscal these markets represented a relatively small portion of our overall system 
table of contents in the us  but historically had a disproportionately negative impact on average unit volumes 
average unit volumes for standard restaurants in the providence and hartford markets were approximately half of our other core markets in the us asset impairment and closure costs in fiscal related to our closure of underperforming company operated restaurants in southern new england and the impairment of our providence and hartford markets in the us the company sold its joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries for a pre tax gain of million on october  long term debt includes long term debt and capital leases  including their current portions 
net income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda attributable to thi is defined as ebitda after deducting ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests 
ebitda is used by management as a performance measure for benchmarking against our peers and our competitors 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry 
ebitda is not a recognized term under us gaap 
ebitda should not be viewed in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to calculate ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
for instance  ebitda does not include interest expense  and because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and because we use property and equipment  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue  and income tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of our operations  tax expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to operate 
additionally  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as capital expenditures  contractual commitments  interest payments  tax payments and debt service requirements 
since not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the following table is a reconciliation of ebitda to our net income fiscal years in thousands net income interest expense  net income tax expense operating income depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests ebitda attributable to tim hortons inc ebitda includes and has not been adjusted for the asset impairment and closure costs  net of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
it has also not been adjusted for the gain on sale from our interest in maidstone bakeries in fiscal of million  partially offset by the million allocated to our restaurant owners  for a total net pre tax gain of million 

table of contents operating margin represents operating income expressed as a percentage of total revenues 
total systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
us dollar sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from the republic of ireland and the united kingdom licensed locations 
includes both franchised and company operated restaurants 
franchised restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately to restaurants whose results of operations are consolidated with ours as variable interest entities 
us average sales per standard and non standard restaurant are disclosed in both canadian and us dollars  the reporting and functional currency  respectively  of our us operations 
the us average sales per standard and non standard restaurant were converted into canadian dollars for each year using the average foreign exchange rate in the applicable year  which includes the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and decreases comparability between the years 
we believe the presentation of the us dollar average sales per standard and non standard restaurant is useful to investors to show the local currency amounts for restaurants in the us and provides transparency on the underlying business performance without the impact of foreign exchange 
our standard restaurant typically measures between  to  square feet  with a dining room  a counter for placing orders and drive thru service 
standard restaurants comprised of our north american system as of january  our non standard restaurants include small  full service restaurants and or self serve kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  airports  grocery stores  gas and convenience locations and drive thru only units on smaller pieces of property  including full serve event sites located in sports arenas and stadiums that operate only during these events with a limited product offering 
included in our us non standard restaurant counts as at january  are event sites 
on average  of these sites were operating during fiscal and had average unit volumes of these sites are important as they heighten brand awareness in our developing markets by exposing the brand to a large number of guests and encourage trial as we generally have product exclusivity at these locations 
non standard restaurants comprised of our north american system as of january  average unit volumes for non standard restaurants exclude volumes from self serve kiosks 
self serve kiosks differ in size and product offering and  as a result  have significantly different economics than our full serve standard and non standard restaurants  including substantially less capital investment  and also contribute significantly less to both systemwide sales as well as our revenues and operating income in each respective region 
self serve kiosks are  however  important as we believe they drive convenience and brand penetration  especially in the us  where our brand is less developed 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the fiscal consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended january  annual report 
all amounts are expressed in canadian dollars unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that are not historical facts  but reflect our current expectations regarding future results 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the matters discussed below 
please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in our annual report for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at franchisee owned restaurants and restaurants run by independent operators collectively  we hereunder refer to both franchisee owned and franchisee operated restaurants as franchised restaurants  and company operated restaurants 
as at january    or of our restaurants were franchised  including in canada and in the united states 
the amount of systemwide sales affects our franchisee royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution income 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants  and are ultimately driven by consumer demand 
same store sales growth represents the average growth in retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide that have been open for thirteen or more months ie  includes both franchised and company operated restaurants 
it is one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance and provides a useful comparison between periods 
we believe systemwide sales and same store sales growth provide meaningful information to investors regarding the size of our system  the overall health and financial performance of the system  and the strength of our brand and restaurant owner base  which ultimately impacts our consolidated and segmented financial performance 
franchised restaurant sales are not generally included in our consolidated financial statements except for certain non owned restaurants consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting rules  however  franchised restaurant sales result in royalties and rental revenues  which are included in our franchise revenues  and also supports growth in distribution sales 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap or gaap 
however  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also contains certain non gaap financial measures to assist readers in understanding the company s performance 
non gaap financial measures either exclude or include amounts that are not reflected in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap

description of business we franchise tim hortons restaurants primarily in canada and the us as the franchisor  we collect royalty income from franchised restaurant sales 
our business model also includes controlling the real estate for the majority of our franchised restaurants  which generates a recurring stream of rental income 
as of january   we leased or owned the real estate for approximately of our full serve system restaurants 
real estate that is not controlled by us is generally for non standard restaurants  including  for example  full serve kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  stadiums  arenas  and airports  as well as self serve kiosks located in gas and convenience locations  and grocery stores 
we distribute coffee and other beverages  non perishable food  
table of contents supplies  packaging and equipment to system restaurants in canada through our distribution centres  and  in some cases  through third party distributors 
in addition to dry goods  we also supply frozen and some refrigerated products from our existing guelph distribution facility  and more recently from our new kingston replacement distribution facility  to approximately of our canadian restaurants  namely those located in ontario and quebec 
construction was completed on our replacement distribution centre in kingston  ontario in the second half of fiscal this facility is now capable of supplying frozen and some refrigerated products  in addition to the dry products that were previously distributed 
we began start up operations in late july  and were servicing approximately restaurants by the end of fiscal in the us  we supply similar products to system restaurants through third party distributors 
in keeping with our vertical integration model  we also operate coffee roasting facilities located in hamilton  ontario  and rochester  new york  and a fondant and fills manufacturing facility in oakville  ontario 
performance against targets the following table sets forth our fiscal actual performance as compared to our fiscal financial targets  as well as management s comments on our performance relative to such targets measure target actual commentary same store sales growth canada us our same store sales growth was driven mainly by menu innovation with quality products introduced at targeted price points which contributed to positive product mix  and combined with pricing  resulted in a higher average cheque in both canada and the us additional advertising targeted at our core growth markets in the us also contributed favourably  and we believe was a significant factor in the strong performance in our us market 
restaurant development canada us restaurants full serve restaurants restaurants full serve restaurants self serve restaurants we ramped up our restaurant development efforts in fiscal and achieved our targets in both canada and the us with a combined total of full serve restaurant openings 
restaurant development in canada was focused on our western and quebec markets  with two thirds of standard restaurant openings and more than half of all new openings occurring in these markets 
in the us  we continued to build scale in our core markets and continued to use self serve restaurant openings as a capital efficient method of increasing brand awareness and convenience within our us markets 
us operating income us million us million us million we achieved record earnings in our us segment in fiscal led primarily by the strength of same store sales growth  as noted above 
we continue to gain momentum and we are pleased with the progress in our us operations 

table of contents measure target actual commentary effective tax rate approximately our effective tax rate was at the low end of our target mainly because we benefited from a combination of a favourable jurisdictional shift of income and preferential tax treatment of certain income items 
diluted earnings per share attributable to tim hortons inc eps a combination of operating income growth driven primarily by continued strength in systemwide sales in both canada and the us  a lower effective tax rate  and our share repurchase program contributed to our eps performance in fiscal actual eps includes an approximate per share reduction related to the ceo separation agreement 
excluding this charge  eps would have been at the higher end of the range 
capital expenditures million million million capital spending was focused on new restaurant development and renovations 
in addition  we completed the construction of our kingston replacement distribution centre 
capital spending was at the lower end of our target due primarily to lower spending on new restaurants 
we had fewer restaurant openings in locations where we had the ability to acquire the real estate and utilized a higher number of capital leases than anticipated 
the separation agreement of million with our former president and chief executive officer  which included severance charges  advisory fees  and other related costs and expenses ceo separation agreement  was not contemplated as part of management s fiscal guidance for eps 
executive overview we continued our strong momentum in fiscal with systemwide sales growth of in fiscal despite economic conditions that remained challenging 
while we began to see some economic stability in north america with unemployment levels and consumer confidence improving slightly  a number of global events transpired in fiscal that posed threats to the north american economic recovery 
these events included supply chain disruptions in the aftermath of the japan tsunami which impacted manufacturing based markets  the volatility of commodity prices which had an impact on commodity based markets  and the european sovereign debt crisis which contributed greatly to general consumer concern 
we are certainly not immune to these global influences  nor north american recessionary and or inflationary impacts  but historically  we have proven to be fairly resilient during challenging economic times  and we continue to believe we are well positioned in both canada and the us  due  in part  to our quality product offerings at reasonable prices 
systemwide sales growth was driven primarily by strong same store sales growth in both canada and the us  with new restaurant development contributing in both markets as well 
new product innovations and introductions in both canada and the us were significant factors driving same store sales growth in fiscal a number of new product introductions contributed to a favourable product mix  and combined with pricing  resulted in a higher average cheque 
total transactions grew in both markets in fiscal  which included transactions from new restaurant development in both canada and the us and continued 
table of contents same store transactions growth in the us partially offsetting these growth factors was continued economic weakness and generally challenging macro operating conditions  which we believe were factors that led to a slight decline in same store transactions in canada 
we opened a total of restaurants which included self serve kiosks in fiscal compared to restaurants which included self serve kiosks in fiscal  with a significant portion occurring in the fourth quarter of each year 
in fiscal  we ramped up our restaurant development in both canada and the us in canada  we focused on increasing convenience in our urban markets and continued our expansion in our quebec and western markets  utilizing a higher proportion of standard restaurant formats over non standard formats 
in the us  we focused most of our development in our core markets with a combination of both standard and non standard locations 
we continue to use self serve kiosks primarily in the us as a capital efficient way of increasing market exposure of the tim hortons brand in new and developing markets 
we execute our development activities in both canada and the us in a disciplined manner and only with what we believe to be the right opportunities 
our flexible we fit anywhere design allows us to scale the size of our restaurants to the market opportunities available 
there were major events that occurred in fiscal that impact the comparability of our operating results year over year 
the first event was the sale of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries maidstone bakeries  which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a significant gain on the sale and  subsequent to the sale  the loss of maidstone bakeries operating income 
the second event was an asset impairment charge relating to our portland  hartford  and providence markets in the new england region and subsequent closure of restaurants primarily in our hartford and providence markets in the us maidstone bakeries we sold our interest in maidstone bakeries for gross cash proceeds of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the sale of maidstone bakeries resulted in a pre tax gain of million  less approximately million which  for accounting purposes  was deferred and is being amortized over the remaining term of the supply agreement  resulting in a net gain of million recognized in fiscal our obligation to purchase donuts and timbits tm from maidstone bakeries extends until early  and we have supply rights until late  at our option  allowing us sufficient flexibility to secure alternative means of supply  if necessary 
in addition  we allocated million from the proceeds of the maidstone bakeries sale to support our key relationship with our restaurant owners  which was intended to help partially mitigate rising operating costs 
collectively  the gain on sale  net of the allocation to our restaurant owners  represented approximately million after tax or approximately per share in fiscal the results of maidstone bakeries were consolidated in our financial results as a variable interest entity vie until october   at which point we were no longer required to consolidate its results 
due to the continuing business relationship that exists  maidstone bakeries did not qualify to be presented as discontinued operations 
in fiscal  maidstone bakeries  on a full consolidation basis  contributed approximately million to operating income and million to net income  of which represents our share of earnings for the ten month period prior to the sale 
partially offsetting this reduced income was the amortization of the supply agreement  which reduced cost of sales by million in fiscal million in fiscal 
asset impairment and closure costs in the second half of fiscal  we determined that the future expected cash flows from our portland  providence and hartford markets were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets in these markets 
in addition  we decided to close restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets and restaurants in our portland market 
the providence and hartford markets were among the most densely penetrated market areas in the us by quick service restaurants  and we were not successful in expanding our customer base to the levels required for future profitability 
as a result  total asset impairment and 
table of contents related closure costs of million were recorded in our us operating segment in fiscal these markets represented a relatively small portion of our overall system in the us  but historically had a disproportionately negative impact on earnings  average unit volumes and same store sales growth in the us segment 
average unit volumes for standard restaurants in the providence and hartford markets were approximately half of those in our other core markets in the us there was no associated tax benefit related to the impairment  so the negative impact on net income was million  or approximately per share in fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to our portland market  which reflected current real estate and equipment values  partially offset by million of previously accrued closure costs which were reversed into operating income upon the substantial conclusion of closure activities related to the above noted closures  for a net impairment charge of million 
financial performance operating income decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the sale of maidstone bakeries in fiscal that was offset  in part  by asset impairment and related closures costs  as noted above 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million in fiscal related to the ceo separation agreement  which included severance charges  advisory fees  and other related costs and expenses 
excluding the three above noted items ie maidstone bakeries  asset impairment and closure costs  and the ceo separation agreement  adjusted operating income increased by million in fiscal  or refer to non gaap reconciliation table on page  driven primarily by strong systemwide sales growth in both canada and the us  resulting in higher rents and royalties and higher distribution income through increased underlying product demand 
partially offsetting this operating growth was higher general and administrative expenses focused primarily on advertising and promotional activities in our core markets in the us  where we made targeted investments that were funded with a portion of the savings we realized from our restaurant closures  in canada on our cold stone creamery co branding initiative  and on our international expansion 
net income attributable to tim hortons inc decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in net income was primarily a result of the net after tax impact of the significant events in fiscal noted above 
absent the impact of these events and the ceo separation agreement  net income attributable to tim hortons inc would have increased by million  or 
the primary factors driving the increase were higher adjusted operating income refer to non gaap reconciliation table on page noted above and a lower effective tax rate on these earnings 
our underlying effective tax rate benefited from statutory tax rate reductions in canada  which lowered our average statutory tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
eps decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal absent the negative impact related to the ceo separation agreement in fiscal  the per share net positive impact of the gain of maidstone bakeries in fiscal  and per share negative impact of the asset impairment and closure costs in fiscal and fiscal  eps growth year over year would have been 
a substantial component of our eps growth resulted from the positive  cumulative impact of our share repurchase programs 
the repurchase programs were primarily funded during fiscal with the use of substantially all of the net proceeds received from the sale of maidstone bakeries  which were fully distributed by september we had approximately million average fully diluted common shares outstanding during fiscal  which was million  or  fewer average fully diluted common shares outstanding than in fiscal 
table of contents performance targets the following table sets forth our performance targets  as well as management s views on achieving such objectives see accompanying notes below measure target commentary same store sales growth canada us we expect to build on our strong same store sales performance from fiscal in both canada and the us by continuing to execute our strategic plan by i creating menu and product innovation to respond to guest needs and trends  ii introducing product and category extensions as well as new product platforms such as chilled drinks and espresso based beverages  iii leveraging our marketing strengths and advantages in canada and increasing capacity at our existing canadian restaurants through the design and implementation of a number of drive thru initiatives  where feasible  and through continued evolution of our in restaurant guest queuing systems  and iv enhancing our brand identity positioning efforts in the us as a unique cafe and bake shop destination focused on freshness and value and sustaining increased marketing and advertising spending with a focus on our core growth markets to increase awareness of our brand in the us restaurant development canada us international restaurants restaurants approximately restaurants we expect to open a total of to restaurant locations

our increased capital expenditures also reflect investments to accelerate renovations in canada  which will feature more contemporary design elements similar to our new restaurant development sites 
in addition  our canadian advertising fund will be investing up to million to expand the use of digital menu boards in our canadian restaurants in fiscal  along with new drive thru rotating menu boards  which we believe will benefit our guests and our restaurant system 
these expenditures are expected to be funded primarily with third party financing  secured by the canadian advertising fund s assets 
as we consolidate our advertising funds as vies for accounting purposes  this transaction will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements accordingly

systemwide sales growth systemwide sales growth  which excludes the effects of foreign exchange  was as a result of continued same store sales growth in canada and the u 
s  and new restaurant expansion in fiscal and our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales primarily in canada and the us  which include restaurant level sales at both franchised and company operated restaurants  although approximately of our system is franchised 
franchised restaurant sales are reported to us by our restaurant owners 
franchised restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately non owned restaurants  on average  for fiscal  whose results of operations are consolidated with ours as vies 
the amount of systemwide sales impacts our royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution income 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants ie  historically  the net addition of new restaurants and are ultimately driven by consumer demand 
systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
foreign currency sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from our republic of ireland and united kingdom licensed locations as these locations operate on a significantly different business model compared to our north american and other international operations 
same store sales growth same store sales growth represents growth  on average  in retail sales at restaurants franchised and company operated restaurants operating systemwide that have been open for thirteen or more months 
it is one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance and provides a useful comparison between periods 
our same store sales growth is generally attributable to several key factors  including new product introductions  improvements in restaurant speed of service and other operational efficiencies  hospitality initiatives  frequency of guest visits  expansion into  and enhancement of  broader menu offerings  promotional activities and pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as coffee and other commodities  labour  supplies  utilities and business expenses 
there can be no assurance that these price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon guests maintaining the frequency of their visits and same volume of purchases at the new pricing 
in fiscal  canadian same store sales increased over fiscal  which was our th consecutive annual increase in canada 
in the us  same store sales measured in us dollars increased in fiscal over fiscal  which represented our st consecutive annual increase 
product innovation is one of our long standing  focused strategies to drive same store sales growth  including innovation at breakfast  lunch and snacking dayparts 
we had strong menu development in fiscal that was designed to provide our guests with additional menu choices by providing a number of new  quality products at various price points 
we introduced specialty bagels  and we enhanced our prepared food offering with the introduction of new breakfast sandwich variations with ham and belt options  our beef lasagna casserole canada only and the panini sandwich launch us only 
we also added new drink categories to our menu  real fruit smoothies and  more recently  lattes and espresso based specialty drinks 
marketing and promotional activities coupled with operating efficiencies and initiatives  during fiscal  also supported same store sales growth in both canada and the us 
table of contents the following tables set forth same store sales growth by quarter for the   and fiscal years and by fiscal year for the year period from to our historical same store sales trends are not necessarily indicative of future results 
historical same store sales increase st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year canada us canada us year average indicates fiscal years that had weeks  for calculation of same store sales increase  the comparative base also includes weeks 

table of contents new restaurant development opening restaurants in new and existing markets in canada and the us has been a significant contributor to our growth 
below is a summary of restaurant openings and closures for our   and fiscal years fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year full serve standard and non standard self serve kiosks total full serve standard and non standard self serve kiosks total full serve standard and non standard self serve kiosks total canada restaurants opened restaurants closed net change us restaurants opened restaurants closed net change international restaurants opened total company restaurants opened restaurants closed net change from the beginning of fiscal to the end of fiscal  we opened system restaurants  net of restaurant closures  including both full serve and self serve locations 
typically  to system restaurants are closed annually  the majority of which have been in canada 
restaurant closures made in the normal course of operations may result from an opportunity to acquire a more suitable location  which will permit us to upgrade size and layout or add a drive thru and typically occur at the end of a lease term or the end of the useful life of the principal asset 
we have also closed  and may continue to close  restaurants for which the restaurant location has performed below our expectations for an extended period of time  and or we believe that sales from the restaurant can be absorbed by surrounding restaurants 
in fiscal  we closed standard restaurants and self serve kiosks in the new england region and in our portland market  all of which arose from strategic profitability reviews of our us operations 
self serve locations generally have significantly different economics than our full serve restaurants  including substantially less capital investment  as well as significantly lower sales in their respective markets and  therefore  lower associated royalties and distribution income 
in the us  self serve locations are intended to increase our brand presence and create another outlet to drive convenience  which we believe is important in our developing markets 
in canada  we have recently used self serve kiosks in locations where existing full service locations are at capacity 
one of our strategic planning initiatives is to grow differently in ways we have not grown before 
initiatives in support of this strategy include the expansion of our cold stone creamery co branding concept 
in fiscal  we began to co brand certain us restaurants with cold stone creamery and  in the second half of fiscal  we expanded this initiative into canada 
we have exclusive development rights in canada  and certain rights to use licenses within the us where a cold stone creamery is located within a tim hortons restaurant  to operate ice cream and frozen confection retail outlets 
as of january   we had co branded locations  including co branded locations in tim hortons restaurants in canada and co branded locations in the us in tim hortons restaurants and in cold stone creamery locations 

table of contents in addition  we opened locations in the gulf cooperation council gcc under our master license agreement with apparel fzco apparel in the second half of fiscal the master license agreement with apparel is primarily a royalty based model that also includes an upfront license fee  opening fees per location  and distribution sales 
apparel is responsible for the capital spending and real estate development to open restaurants  along with operations and marketing 
tim hortons restaurant design generally evolves with changing business and guest needs 
in fiscal  we began testing an enhanced restaurant design in certain us markets to further differentiate our brand as a cafe and bake shop destination 
we have completed our testing of this enhanced design  and based on results  we are now applying significant elements of the enhanced design in all new restaurants in the us  including certain interior and exterior design treatments  menu items  equipment and fixtures 
in  we are also incorporating various elements from this design into our new canadian restaurants as well as renovations 
the following table shows our restaurant count as of the end of fiscal  and and provides a breakdown of our company operated and franchised restaurants 
systemwide restaurant count fiscal year canada company operated franchised standard and non standard franchised self serve kiosks total franchised us company operated franchised standard and non standard franchised self serve kiosks total franchised international gcc franchised standard franchised n a n a total system company operated franchised standard and non standard franchised self serve kiosks total franchised segment operating income loss systemwide sales and same store sales growth is affected by the business and economic environments in canada and the us we manage and review financial results from canadian and us operations separately 
we  therefore  have determined the reportable segments for our business to be the geographic locations of canada and the us each segment includes the gross operating results of all manufacturing and distribution operations that are located in their respective geographic locations 
we continue to manage the development of our international 
table of contents operations in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  which consist primarily of branded  licensed self serve kiosk locations  corporately 
in addition  our international operations now include our expansion into the gcc  which is in its early stages and is also being managed corporately 
as such  results from these operations are included in corporate charges in our segmented operating results and  currently  are not significant 
our reportable segments generally exclude vies financial results  reflective of the way our business is managed

beginning in fiscal  we modified certain allocation methods resulting in changes in the classification of certain costs  with the main change being corporate information technology infrastructure costs are now included in corporate charges rather than in the canadian operating segment 
this change has been consistently applied for all comparative periods 
corporate charges include overhead costs that support all business segments  and the operating results associated with our international operations discussed above  which are being managed corporately 
fiscal compared to fiscal a number of events occurring in both fiscal and fiscal operating income  as outlined below  significantly impact the comparability of results year over year 
consolidated operating income declined by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal our canadian segment included the disposition of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries in october  which resulted in a significant gain on the sale of million  partially offset by a related million restaurant owner allocation 
in addition  prior to the sale of maidstone bakeries  we consolidated of its results as a vie 
as such  our fiscal consolidated operating income included of maidstone 
table of contents bakeries operating income prior to the sale  which was million 
for reportable segment purposes  of maidstone bakeries operating income was included in canada and the remaining was included in vies  which was consistent with the underlying legal ownership of maidstone bakeries and ultimately  with the views of our chief decision maker 
amortization of million and million related to the deferred gain allocated to our continuing supply agreement with maidstone bakeries was included in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as a positive contribution to earnings 
in total  these items represented million of the decrease in operating income for our canadian segment year over year 
our us segment included asset impairment and related closure costs of million in fiscal related to certain markets in the new england region  as we determined that the future expected cash flows of these markets were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets in these markets  and we closed restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets and restaurants in our portland market 
the providence and hartford markets were among the most densely penetrated market areas in the us by quick service restaurants  and while progress was achieved  we were ultimately not successful in expanding our customer base to the levels required for future profitability within a reasonable period of time 
in fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge  net of a recovery of previously accrued closure costs  of million 
approximately million related to our us vies  whereas our us segment included a net recovery of million related to the reversal of previously accrued closure costs  net of an asset impairment charge 
in total  these items represented million of the increase in operating income for our us segment year over year 
adjusted operating income  which excludes the above noted items and the ceo separation agreement see non gaap reconciliation table on page  increased by million in fiscal  or 
the underlying growth was driven primarily by our canadian operating segment  with strong systemwide sales resulting from same store sales growth at existing locations and incremental systemwide sales at new restaurants  both of which drove higher rents and royalties and distribution income 
our us segment s strong systemwide sales growth resulted in significant underlying operating income growth year over year 
absent the ceo separation agreement  corporate charges were lower and  coupled with improved vie income excluding the asset impairment charge  also contributed favourably to our growth 
canada in fiscal  operating income for our canadian segment was million compared to million in fiscal excluding the above noted items totaling million  the underlying operating income of our canadian segment increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to systemwide sales growth of  driven by same store sales growth of and incremental sales from the net addition of new restaurants during the year 
comparatively  systemwide sales growth was in fiscal week basis  including same store sales growth of and incremental sales from the net addition of restaurants 
total restaurant transactions in fiscal continued to grow as a result of the net addition of new restaurants 
same store sales growth in fiscal was driven by an increase in average cheque  which benefited from both favourable product mix and pricing 
our product mix was favourably influenced by a strong promotional calendar  including new breakfast sandwich variations with ham and belt options  our new beef lasagna casserole  as well as the introduction of our specialty bagels 
we also launched new drink categories with our popular real fruit smoothies  and more recently  our espresso based specialty coffee products 
partially offsetting these growth factors was continued economic weakness and generally challenging macro operating conditions  which we believe were factors that led to slightly lower same store transactions in quarters of fiscal we opened restaurants in canada  of which were self serve kiosks  and closed restaurants  of which were self serve kiosks  in fiscal comparatively  we opened restaurants including self serve kiosks and closed restaurants in fiscal our new restaurant development was skewed more heavily toward the fourth quarter in each year 

table of contents canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income  as well as higher income from our distribution business 
the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to manage costs to our restaurant owners and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
partially offsetting this growth in segment operating income were higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business as well as investments in our co branding strategy 
in addition  we incurred start up and transition costs associated with the ramp up of our replacement distribution facility in kingston  ontario  which began in late july and is now capable of supplying refrigerated and frozen products  in addition to its previous dry products capabilities  to restaurant owners in eastern ontario and quebec 
the kingston facility was servicing approximately restaurants by the end of fiscal us in fiscal  operating income from our us segment was million compared to an operating loss of million 
excluding of the above noted items totaling million  the underlying operating income of our us segment increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal we continued to make significant improvements in our us segment profitability despite a persistently challenging macro economic climate in many of our core markets in the us systemwide sales growth of was driven by same store sales growth of and growth of from the net addition of full serve restaurants to the system year over year  partially offset by the closure of restaurants in the new england region late in fiscal same store sales growth in fiscal was driven primarily by an increase in average cheque  which benefited from pricing in the system and from a favourable product mix  and moderately higher transactions contributed to the growth as well 
our product mix was favourably influenced by a strong promotional calendar  including our new panini sandwiches launched late in fiscal  and specialty bagels 
in addition  we promoted our popular real fruit smoothies  new frozen lemonade and  similar to canada  we recently introduced our espresso based specialty coffee products 
moderately higher transactions during fiscal were supported by these new products and our enhanced menu  and by increased marketing and promotional efforts  which were designed to increase brand awareness  and guest traffic 
we opened restaurants in the us  of which were full serve standard and non standard restaurants  and closed restaurants in fiscal comparatively  we opened restaurants including self serve kiosks and closed restaurants in fiscal  of which were in the new england region and to were in our portland market 
similar to canada  our new restaurant development in the us was skewed more heavily toward the fourth quarter in each year 
although self serve kiosks contribute minimally to systemwide sales and operating earnings  they are one of the ways we seed our brand and offer convenience to our guests in a capital efficient manner 
us systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income  as well as higher income from our distribution business 
our distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
the closure of certain underperforming restaurants  in fiscal  contributed approximately million to the improvement in the us segment operating income due to lower relief and lower depreciation and support costs 
partially offsetting this growth was the reinvestment of approximately million of our savings from these closed restaurants into our core us growth markets in northeast and midwest us in fiscal by increasing our advertising and marketing scale to expand awareness of our brand 
we believe that this investment was one of the key drivers of our us systemwide sales performance in fiscal we are typically able to identify restaurant owners for new restaurants  but in certain developing markets  it may be more challenging  however  it has not historically been a major impediment to our growth 
despite the current economic climate and credit conditions  our restaurant owners continue to have access to lending programs with third party lenders  although processing may take longer and costs may be higher  consistent with prevailing market conditions 
we continue to experience a higher number of past due notes under our franchise 
table of contents incentive program fip  with approximately of the notes past due as of january  in many cases  we have also chosen to hold the note for a longer period of time than we have historically done to allow the restaurant more time to achieve certain profitability targets or to accommodate a restaurant owner seeking to obtain third party financing 
if a restaurant owner does not repay the note  we are able to take back ownership of the restaurant and equipment  based on the terms of the underlying franchise agreement  which collateralizes the note and  therefore  minimizes our credit risk 
in fiscal  we began entering into operator agreements more frequently than full franchise agreements when opening new restaurants  which are not eligible for a fip 
after these restaurant are established and reach certain profitability measures  we may sell the restaurant to the operator under a full franchise agreement with the restaurant owner s financing provided by a third party rather than through a fip arrangement 
variable interest entities our vies income before income tax pertains to the entities that  for accounting purposes  we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
these entities included maidstone bakeries  until the date of the sale of our joint venture interest in october  and certain non owned restaurants 
in fiscal  the income attributable to vies was million  compared to million in fiscal  of which maidstone bakeries represented million 
operating income of million from non owned restaurants in fiscal was driven by canada contributing million and was partially offset by a loss of million from the us the us loss was due to an asset impairment charge of million related to the portland market 
in fiscal  non owned consolidated restaurants contributed million of operating income  primarily from canadian vies with million  partially offset by a loss of million from us vies 
the majority of the restaurants we closed in the new england region in the fourth quarter of fiscal were previously included within our us non owned consolidated restaurants 
these restaurants were underperforming restaurants and thus negatively impacted the overall operating profit from vies within the us in fiscal we consolidated and non owned restaurants  on average  in fiscal and  respectively 
approximately of non owned restaurants that we consolidated were us non owned consolidated restaurants approximately in fiscal 
these us locations have historically had lower revenues and income than canadian non owned consolidated restaurants 
corporate charges corporate charges include overhead costs that support all business segments  and the operating results associated with our international operations  which continue to be managed corporately 
corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary factor contributing to higher corporate charges year over year was the million charge related to the ceo separation agreement  partially offset by lower professional fees due to spending on a number of corporate initiatives in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal the company has branded  licensed locations in the republic of ireland and in the united kingdom  which are primarily self serve kiosks operating under the tim hortons brand in fiscal 
these kiosks are operated by independent licensed retailers 
the distribution of coffee and donuts through licensed locations with respect to these self serve kiosks is not a material contributor to our net income and  therefore  is netted in corporate charges 
we have a master license agreement with apparel to develop up to multi format restaurants over a year period in the gcc 
under this agreement  full serve  franchised restaurants were opened in the united arab emirates within the gcc during the second half of fiscal we are currently managing our international expansion corporately 
our top priority continues to be growing our canadian and us businesses 
operating results from our irish  united kingdom and gcc international operations are currently not significant 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal reportable segment operating income increased million  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  and  as a percentage of total revenues  was and  respectively 
our canadian segment included a million gain on the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries  less million allocated to our restaurant owners and million of income relating to the amortization of our deferred gain in connection with our supply agreement with maidstone bakeries 
also included in our fiscal segment operating income are asset impairment and related closure costs of million related to certain markets in the new england region that was recorded in our us segment 
excluding the gain on sale and related impacts  allocation to restaurant owners and asset impairment and related closure costs  reportable segment operating income would have increased million  or 
fiscal had weeks of operations whereas fiscal included a rd week of operations 
the rd week reduced fiscal segment revenues and reportable segment operating income growth rates by approximately and  respectively 
canada exclusive of the items described above  our canadian segment operating income increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to systemwide sales increases and increased contribution from our distribution business 
canadian same store sales growth was in fiscal  which includes some pricing benefits 
in fiscal  we opened restaurants in canada and closed  compared to opening restaurants and closing in fiscal transaction growth continued to add to same store sales growth  benefiting from menu initiatives  promotions  and operational initiatives such as our hospitality program 
we also co branded locations in fiscal with cold stone creamery  which contributed slightly to the segment s same store sales growth and contributed positively to our canadian franchise fee income 
the rd week reduced our fiscal operating income growth rate by approximately in canada 
canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income  as well as higher income from our distribution business 
the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
also contributing to our canadian segment operating income growth was our new coffee roasting facility in hamilton  ontario  which began operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal partially offsetting this growth in segment operating income were higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business as well as investments in our hospitality and co branding strategies and lower franchise fee income primarily due to a shift in mix of restaurant type openings to a greater number of non standard restaurants with lower franchise fees 
our canadian segment operating income included of operating income from our previously held interest in maidstone bakeries 
due to the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries on october   the income in fiscal only included months of operations  as compared to months in fiscal us in fiscal  our us segment had an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million in fiscal the operating loss was entirely due to the asset impairment and closure costs recorded in the second half of fiscal relating to our underperforming restaurants in the new england region described below 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  we would have more than doubled our us segment operating income from fiscal to million in fiscal this was a considerable improvement over the prior year  due  in large part  to same store sales growth of amid a continued challenging macro economic climate in many of our core markets in the us the closure of the underperforming restaurants also contributed to the improvement in us segment operating income as it resulted in higher rents and royalties due primarily to lower relief 
the rd week had a minimal impact on our fiscal operating income growth rate in the us 
table of contents during the third quarter of fiscal  asset impairment and related closure cost charges of million were recorded in our us operating segment based on our decision to close restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets and restaurants in our portland market 
these charges were comprised of million as an asset impairment charge and million in restaurant closure costs representing primarily lease commitment obligations 
we also adapted our marketing and promotional activities to the challenging economic environment and related circumstances 
commencing in fiscal  a number of our competitors also commenced and or intensified discounting heightened by the continuing economic challenges in north america and combo or value pricing practices  as well as free product promotions 
this cross over of brands and menu offerings  and increased competition on price and other factors  continued through fiscal in fiscal  we continued to offer targeted value priced food and beverage programs  in addition to the launch of new products at a variety of everyday value price points 
in the us  we also introduced the use of coupons as a vehicle to attract new customers and introduce them to our brand and new product offerings 
during fiscal  we opened new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closed restaurants and self serve kiosks in the us  as compared to opening new restaurants and closing restaurants  in fiscal the majority of the self serve openings in fiscal were part of an expansion of our strategic alliance with tops friendly markets and are located in tops stores in western and central new york  and northern pennsylvania 
although self serve kiosks contributed minimally to sales and operating earnings  they are one of the ways we seed our brand and offer convenience to our customers 
variable interest entities our vies income before income tax pertains to the entities that we are required to consolidate in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
these entities include maidstone bakeries  until the date of sale of our joint venture ownership interest  and certain non owned restaurants 
in fiscal  our vies income before income tax was million as compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million related to maidstone bakeries  respectively 
the year over year decrease in income from maidstone bakeries is due to only months of income consolidated in our fiscal results prior to selling our interest on october  we consolidated approximately restaurants on average in fiscal and  with a greater proportion representing us non owned consolidated restaurants as a result of the progression of us restaurants to our operator model versus company operated restaurants and increased participation in our fip 
corporate charges corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million increase primarily reflects higher salary and benefit costs  of which a significant portion related to increased stock based compensation costs  reflecting a higher common share price year over year 
in addition  higher professional fees were incurred relating to corporate initiatives including developing our international strategy 
partially offsetting these higher costs were the professional advisory and shareholder costs associated with our public company reorganization in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal  which amounted to million

rents and royalties revenues consist of i royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchised restaurant sales  and ii rents  which consist of base and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us  and typically range from to of gross franchised restaurant sales 
franchised restaurant sales are reported to us by our restaurant owners 
franchised restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and non owned restaurants  on average  in fiscal and whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
franchised restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and 
table of contents rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution income 
the reported franchised restaurant sales including those consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules were fiscal years franchised restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars revenues our revenues include sales  which is comprised of distribution sales  sales from company operated restaurants  sales from vies that we consolidated  for accounting purposes  as we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  and franchise revenues 
sales sales for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  to  million 
the increase in sales was primarily driven from our distribution business  but was also favourably impacted by the million allocation made to restaurant owners in fiscal  which was recorded as a reduction of sales  and to a lesser extent  higher company operated restaurant sales 
partially offsetting these increases were lower sales from vies 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  from  million to  million in fiscal systemwide sales growth increased distribution sales by approximately million due to continued same store sales growth and the higher number of system restaurants year over year  and new products managed through our supply chain  including additional output from maidstone bakeries 
favourable product mix and pricing represented approximately million of the increase in distribution sales  due primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities reflective of the higher underlying costs 
in addition  growth year over year benefited from a million reduction in fiscal sales related to the restaurant owner allocation made in relation to the sale of maidstone bakeries 
our distribution revenues continue to be subject to changes related to underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  wheat  sugar  and other product costs 
increases and decreases in underlying costs are largely passed through to restaurant owners  but will typically occur after changes in spot market prices as we utilize fixed price contracts as a method to provide restaurant owners with consistent  predictable pricing and to secure a stable source of supply 
we generally have forward purchasing contracts in place for months of future supply for our key commodities  but have occasionally extended beyond this time frame in periods of elevated market volatility or tight supply conditions 
underlying commodity costs can also be impacted by currency changes 
these cost changes can impact distribution sales  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
these changes may impact margins in a quarter as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up over a pricing period which may extend beyond a quarter 
in fiscal  the loss of earnings associated with our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries due to the sale  net of the amortization of the deferred gain in connection with our supply agreement  negatively impacted our margin percentage by approximately basis points 
company operated restaurants sales 
company operated restaurant sales vary with the average number and mix ie  size  location and type of company operated restaurants 
company operated restaurant sales were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal on average  we operated company operated restaurants during fiscal compared to during fiscal restaurants with higher sales were the primary driver of sales growth year over year  partially offset by a shift towards a higher proportion of transitional us company operated restaurants  which generally have lower average sales than canadian company operated restaurants  and a lower number of restaurants on average during the year 

table of contents we ended fiscal with company operated restaurants in canada  and in the us  representing in total approximately of total systemwide restaurants 
on occasion  we may repurchase restaurants from existing restaurant owners  operate them corporately for a short period of time  and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is also impacted by the timing of these events throughout the year 
variable interest entities sales 
vies sales represent sales from the consolidation of certain non owned restaurants of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  and also included sales from the consolidation of our previously held joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries  which are not included in our fiscal results 
sales from vies were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in sales of million was primarily due to the disposition and deconsolidation of maidstone bakeries in october maidstone bakeries represented million of the sales decline  which was partially offset in distribution sales in fiscal in addition  the number of non owned restaurants consolidated  on average  in the us last year included many of the underperforming new england region restaurants  which  as discussed within segment operating income above  were closed in late fiscal  resulting in fewer restaurants and lower sales being included in fiscal partially offsetting these sales declines were an increase in the number of canadian restaurants consolidated  and in restaurants with higher sales volumes  both of which contributed positively to sales 
during fiscal  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants in canada and in the us  on average  compared to non owned restaurants in canada and in the us  on average  during fiscal foreign exchange 
sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal systemwide sales growth was driven primarily by higher same store sales and sales from new restaurants opened during the year  both of which resulted in higher royalty and rental revenues because both are typically based  in whole or part  on a percentage of restaurant sales 
same store sales growth during fiscal provided approximately million of rents and royalties growth 
the net addition of new full service restaurants in canada and the us year over year and the net restaurants additions from fiscal which have not yet been open for more than months contributed approximately million 
lower relief  primarily recognized in the us  mainly from the closure of underperforming restaurants in certain markets in the new england region in the fourth quarter of fiscal  contributed much of the remaining growth 
partially offsetting these growth factors was a negative impact resulting from the consolidation of non owned restaurant vies which  as noted above  had a higher weighting of canadian vies in fiscal the consolidation of non owned restaurants essentially replaces our rents and royalties with restaurant sales  which are included in vie sales 
franchise fees 
franchise fees were million in fiscal  increasing million over fiscal a higher number of standard and non standard restaurant openings were the primary growth driver during fiscal in addition  a higher number of resales and replacements  and the recognition of fees associated with our master license agreement with apparel related to our international expansion  also contributed to growth year over year 
a replacement restaurant refers to a site change that results in a rebuild generally within a kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
partially offsetting these growth factors were fewer cold stone creamery co branded openings in canada

non standard restaurants include full serve kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  grocery stores  universities  stadiums  arenas and office buildings 
in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in fiscal compared to self serve kiosks in fiscal self serve kiosks do not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants  due primarily to the size of the equipment package required

cost of sales growth was driven by higher distribution cost of sales  higher cost of sales from vies and  to a much lesser extent  higher company operated restaurants cost of sales 
distribution cost of sales 
distribution cost of sales increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  driven mainly by systemwide sales growth and products for which we now manage the supply chain logistics  including additional output from maidstone bakeries  which  when combined  contributed approximately million of the increase in cost of sales 
approximately million of the distribution cost of sales increase related primarily to higher underlying commodity costs  specifically coffee  and product mix 
we began start up operations at our kingston replacement distribution facility in late july and incurred certain start up costs in the second half of fiscal our distribution costs are subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  wheat  sugar  and other product costs 
underlying product costs can also be impacted by currency fluctuations 
increases and decreases in product costs are largely passed through to restaurant owners  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
these changes may also impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up over a pricing period which may extend beyond a quarter and can create volatility when compared to the prior year see item a

these costs increased by million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal cost of sales increased from restaurants with higher sales and consequently higher cost of sales 
this increase was partially offset by a shift towards a higher proportion of

in addition  we operated fewer company operated restaurants  on average  during the year 
variable interest entities cost of sales 
vies cost of sales was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
vies cost of sales represents cost of sales from the consolidation of certain non owned restaurants of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  and also included cost of sales from the consolidation of our previously held joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries  which was not included in fiscal beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we began managing the supply chain logistics for a more significant proportion of output from maidstone bakeries  which is reflected as a higher distribution cost of sales in fiscal  as noted above 
the disposition and deconsolidation of maidstone bakeries in october resulted in higher overall cost of sales year over year  as we no longer benefited from the integration of this facility 
during fiscal  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants  on average  compared to non owned restaurants  on average  during fiscal the decline in non owned restaurants year over year was largely the result of the closure of underperforming new england restaurants in late fiscal  many of which were consolidated as vies 
notwithstanding this decline  we had more restaurants consolidated in canada as well as restaurants with higher sales volumes  and consequently higher cost of sales  both of which resulted in an increase in vie cost of sales

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal a significant portion of this increase was related to the million charge related to the ceo separation agreement

in addition  we also incurred higher salaries and benefits in support of the growth in our business 
partially offsetting these higher costs were lower professional fees in fiscal compared to those incurred for corporate initiatives in fiscal in general  our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed systemwide sales growth over the longer term 
there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to the timing of certain expenses or events that may impact growth rates in any particular quarter 
from time to time  we may increase investments to support certain strategic initiatives  which may cause general and administrative expense growth to be higher than systemwide sales growth

table of contents restaurants  on average whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to applicable accounting rules

the reported franchised restaurant sales including those consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules were fiscal years franchised restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars revenues sales sales for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  to  million 
the increase in sales was primarily driven from our distribution business  however  partially offsetting the increase were lower sales from vies consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting rules and company operated restaurants 
also negatively impacting year over year sales growth was the million allocation made to restaurant owners which has been recorded as a reduction of sales 
fiscal also had the benefit of an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week of operations  which impacted sales growth in fiscal by approximately 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  from  million to  million driven by continued systemwide sales growth and new products managed through our supply chain  product mix and higher commodity prices contributed to distribution sales growth 
systemwide sales growth increased distribution sales by approximately million due to continued same store sales growth and the higher number of system restaurants year over year  and new products managed through our supply chain  including additional output from maidstone bakeries 
product mix and pricing related primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities due to higher underlying costs also contributed to the sales increase 
distribution sales growth was negatively impacted by the million allocation to restaurant owners made in relation to the sale of maidstone bakeries in the fourth quarter of fiscal distribution sales growth was also negatively impacted by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations in fiscal  as well as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates

variable interest entities sales 
vie sales include sales from the consolidation of our previously held interest in maidstone bakeries and from the consolidation of certain non owned restaurants in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
vie sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline is mainly due to a more significant proportion of output from maidstone bakeries being managed and billed through our supply chain 
in addition  the sale and de consolidation of maidstone bakeries in october resulted in only months of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which had a full year of operations 
the majority of non owned restaurants that are consolidated operate either solely under an operator agreement or are franchised locations participating in our fip 
on average  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants during fiscal and while the overall number of non owned consolidated restaurants remained consistent  a greater proportion of us non owned restaurants were consolidated as a result of the progression of us restaurants to the owner operator model from company 
table of contents operated restaurants noted previously 
these us locations had lower sales and income than canadian non owned restaurants that were previously consolidated 
also contributing to the year over year sales decline is the impact of approximately from the inclusion of a rd week of operations in fiscal foreign exchange

the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal  ahead of fiscal systemwide sales growth of  unadjusted for currency 
systemwide sales growth was driven by higher same store sales and sales from new restaurants opened during the year  both of which resulted in higher royalty and rental revenues because both are typically based  in whole or part  on a percentage of restaurant sales 
rents and royalty growth was driven by overall systemwide sales growth and lower relief  partially offset by unfavourable foreign exchange 
both canada and the us excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation contributed to our growth in rents and royalties revenues largely in proportion to their overall share of systemwide sales 
continued same store sales growth provided million to our rents and royalties growth  while the addition of new full serve restaurants in the system and fiscal restaurants which have not yet been open for or more months year over year contributed approximately million 
relief  which was primarily all within our us operations  was lower in fiscal on a year to date basis as compared to fiscal  partially due to foreign exchange and lower relief provided  due mainly from less week of operations in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  from the closure of restaurants in the new england region 
rents and royalties growth was negatively impacted by approximately due to an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week in fiscal which we did not benefit from in fiscal franchise fees 
franchise fees were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in franchise fees year over year was primarily the result of adding co branded cold stone creamery locations either within existing or new tim hortons locations  mainly in canada 
partially offsetting this increase were lower franchise fee revenues recognized under our fip  and a change in restaurant mix to a higher number of non standard locations 
in fiscal  we opened a total of standard and non standard restaurants  excluding self serve kiosks  consistent with standard and non standard restaurants openings in fiscal in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in fiscal compared to self serve kiosks in fiscal while self serve kiosks represented a disproportionate amount of overall unit growth in fiscal  they did not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units were significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants  due primarily to the size of the equipment package required

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity has historically been  and continues to be  cash generated from canadian operations which has  for the most part  self funded our operations  growth in new restaurants  capital expenditures  dividends  normal course share repurchases  acquisitions and investments 
our million revolving bank facility revolving bank facility provides an additional source of liquidity  if needed 
in  we may occasionally use our revolving bank facility as a short term source of cash due to the timing of expenditures being made in advance of cash generated from canadian operations 
our us operations have historically been a net user of cash given investment plans and stage of growth  and we expect this trend to continue through in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations  as compared to cash generated from operations of million in fiscal  for a net decrease of million see comparative cash flows below for a description of sources and uses of cash in fiscal 
we believe that we will continue to generate adequate operating cash flows to fund both our capital expenditures and expected debt service requirements over the next twelve months 
if additional funds are needed for strategic initiatives or other corporate purposes beyond current availability under our revolving bank facility  we believe  with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong capital structure  we could borrow additional funds 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited by our financial and other covenants under our revolving bank facility

the effective yield including all fees  premium and the impact of the interest rate forwards loss is 
the senior notes bear a fixed interest coupon rate of with interest payable in semi annual installments  in arrears  which commenced december  the senior notes rank equally and pari passu with each other and with the notes of every other series regardless of their actual time of issue issued under the trust indenture  and  with all other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of tim hortons inc the borrower  including amounts owing under the revolving bank facility see below  except as to any sinking fund which pertains exclusively to any particular indebtedness of the borrower and statutory preferred exceptions 
the senior notes are initially guaranteed by the tdl group corp 
tdl  the borrower s largest canadian subsidiary 
for as long as the borrower s and tdl s third party revenues represent at least of the consolidated revenues of the company  as tested quarterly on a rolling twelve month basis  tdl will remain the sole guarantor 
to the extent combined third party revenues of these entities is less than of consolidated revenues  additional guarantors must be added until of consolidated revenues are reached or exceeded 
in each case  the borrower s subsidiary with the highest gross revenue must be one of the guarantors 
alternatively  if the borrower s third party revenues reach or exceed of consolidated revenues  the guarantors will be released 
there are also certain covenants limiting liens to secure borrowed money subject to permitted exceptions and limiting our ability to undertake certain acquisitions and dispositions subject to compliance with certain requirements 
the senior notes are redeemable  at the borrower s option  at any time  upon not less than days notice  but no more than days notice  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i a price calculated to provide a yield to maturity from the redemption date equal to the yield on a non callable government of canada bond with a maturity equal to  or as close as possible to  the remaining term to maturity of the senior notes  plus  and ii par  together  in each case  with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date fixed for redemption 
in the event of a change of control and a resulting rating downgrade to below investment grade  the borrower will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
in march  we entered into interest rate forwards with a notional amount of million as a cash flow hedge to limit the interest rate volatility in the period prior to the issuance of the senior notes 
these interest rate forwards were settled in june  resulting in a loss of million of which million remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
this loss is being recognized in interest expense over the year term of the senior notes  as noted above 
when evaluating our leverage position  we look at metrics that consider the impact of long term operating and capital leases as well as other long term debt obligations 
we believe this provides a more meaningful measure of our leverage position given our significant investments in real estate 
at january   we had approximately million in long term debt and capital leases on our balance sheet 
we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet  including our cash position  provides us with opportunity and flexibility for future growth while still enabling us to return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and our share repurchase program 
given the ongoing credit concerns in financial markets  we continue to be more focused on capital preservation than yield when investing cash 
we invest primarily in short term money market instruments of several canadian financial institutions  thereby minimizing both the liquidity risk and counterparty risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction  renovations of existing restaurants  expansion of our business through vertical integration and general corporate needs 
in addition  we utilize cash to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 
historically  our annual working capital needs have not been significant  however  currently our needs have increased due to higher green coffee inventory levels and elevated levels of finished goods in support of our specialty coffee promotion in early we do not anticipate our finished goods or green coffee inventory volumes to remain at current levels for an extended period of time  although green coffee inventory values can fluctuate with changes in commodity costs 
in each of the last fiscal years  operating cash flows have funded our capital expenditure requirements for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
our more than a great brand strategic plan outlined key aspects of our business that we intend to focus on until the end of leveraging significant levels of vertical integration and continuing to explore additional systemwide benefits through vertical integration was one of the key initiatives outlined in the strategic plan 
consistent with that plan  we have completed construction of a replacement distribution centre in kingston  ontario  which is capable of providing one stop service to our restaurant owners in eastern ontario and quebec by adding warehouse capacity and distribution capability for frozen and refrigerated products in addition to dry goods 
we began start up operations at this facility in late july and incurred certain start up costs in the second half of fiscal we were servicing approximately restaurants by the end of fiscal as with other vertical integration initiatives  we expect this new facility will deliver important system benefits  including improved efficiency and cost effective service for our restaurant owners  as well as providing a reasonable financial return for the company 
we continue to believe that distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to manage costs to our restaurants owners and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our overall profitability 
our capital spending in is expected to be higher than in previous years as we will be executing a number of operational initiatives along with our restaurant owners and may continue at these higher levels in the future 
in addition to restaurant development in both canada and the us  our increased spending also includes our share of investments to increase restaurant capacity in canada including initiatives such as selectively implementing drive thru order station relocations  double order stations and  double lane drive thrus 
our increased capital expenditures also reflect investments to accelerate renovations in canada  which will feature more contemporary design elements similar to our new restaurant development locations 
we will also continue with the installation of digital menu boards  along with new drive thru rotating menu boards  that began late in fiscal to enhance our overall guest experience at our canadian restaurants 
this menu board capital initiative will be funded directly by our canadian advertising fund  which we expect to be financed primarily with third party borrowings  secured by the advertising fund s assets 
in fiscal  we continued to repurchase shares under our previously announced share repurchase program  which authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common shares  not to exceed the regulatory maximum of  shares  which was equivalent to of the public float of the company as defined in section of the tsx company manual at the time of regulatory approval on february  the program  which received toronto stock exchange tsx approval on february  under tsx normal course issuer bid rules  commenced on march  and is due to terminate on march   or earlier if the million or share maximum is reached 
the first purchases were made under the program on march   and the aggregate dollar value of shares that we currently expect to purchase under the program is approximately million 
the program was funded from cash flow generation and cash on hand and  in addition  up to million from the remaining undistributed net proceeds from the maidstone bakeries sale in october under the program  shares were repurchased through a combination of a b  or automatic trading program  and through management s discretion  subject to regulatory requirements  market  cost  and other considerations 
in fiscal  we spent approximately million to purchase and cancel approximately million shares under our share repurchase programs at an average cost of per share 

table of contents on february   our board of directors approved and we obtained regulatory approval from the toronto stock exchange tsx to commence a new share repurchase program program for up to million in common shares  not to exceed the regulatory maximum of  shares  representing of our public float as of february   as defined under the tsx rules 
subject to the negotiation and execution of a broker agreement  our common shares will be purchased under the program through a combination of a b automatic trading plan purchases  as well as purchases at management s discretion in compliance with regulatory requirements  and given market  cost and other considerations 
repurchases will be made on the tsx  the new york stock exchange nyse  and or other canadian marketplaces  subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  or by such other means as may be permitted by the tsx and or nyse  and under applicable laws  including private agreements under an issuer bid exemption order issued by a securities regulatory authority in canada 
purchases made by way of private agreements under an issuer bid exemption order by a securities regulatory authority will be at a discount to the prevailing market price as provided in the exemption order 
the program will expire on march   or earlier if the million or the share maximum is reached 
common shares purchased pursuant to the program will be cancelled 
the program may be terminated by us at any time  subject to compliance with regulatory requirements 
as such  there can be no assurance regarding the total number of shares or the equivalent dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the program 
our outstanding share capital is comprised of common shares 
an unlimited number of common shares  without par value  is authorized  and we had  common shares outstanding at january  as at this same date  we had issued options to acquire  of our common shares to officers of the corporation pursuant to our stock incentive plan  of which  were exercisable 
our board of directors approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per common share in february in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per common share  totaling approximately million at this new rate 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totaling approximately million 
our long term  targeted dividend payout range is of prior year  normalized annual net income attributable to tim hortons inc  which is net income attributable to tim hortons inc adjusted for certain discrete items  such as gains on divestitures  tax impacts and asset impairments  that affect our annual net income attributable to tim hortons inc in february  our board of directors approved an increase in the dividend from to per common share paid quarterly  representing an increase of  reflecting our strong cash flow position  which allows us to continue our first priority of funding our business growth investment needs while still returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
the board declared the first quarterly dividend at the increased rate of per share  payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  dividends are declared and paid in canadian dollars to all shareholders with canadian resident addresses 
for us resident shareholders  dividends paid will be converted to us dollars based on prevailing exchange rates at time of conversion by the clearing and depository services inc for beneficial shareholders and by us for registered shareholders 
notwithstanding our targeted payout range and the recent increase in our dividend  the declaration and payment of all future dividends remains subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the company s continued financial performance  debt covenant compliance  and other risk factors 
we have historically paid for all dividends primarily from cash generated from our operations  and we expect to continue to do so in 
table of contents credit facilities we have an unsecured revolving bank facility  which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal  replacing our prior senior bank facility 
the revolving bank facility was set to mature on december   however subsequent to the end of fiscal we amended the facility on january th  to take advantage of reduced commitment fees and applicable margins  and extend the term to january th  the facility is now supported by a syndicate of financial institutions  of which canadian financial institutions hold approximately of the total funding commitment 
we use the borrowings under the revolving bank facility for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions and other business initiatives 
the revolving bank facility has the same guarantee structure as the senior notes and may be drawn by the borrower or tdl  and as such  has a tim hortons inc guarantee that cannot be released 
the revolving bank facility is for million which includes million overdraft availability and million letter of credit facility 
the revolving bank facility is undrawn  except for approximately million fiscal million to support standby letters of credit 
we also incur commitment fees  whether the facility is used or unused 
under the revolvers  the commitment fees varied according to the our leverage ratio  whereas under the revolving bank facility the commitment fees vary according to our credit rating on our senior notes and  as at both january  and january   equaled of the facility amount 
the revolving bank facility provides variable rate funding options including bankers acceptances or libor base rate or prime rate loans plus an applicable margin 
this facility does not carry a market disruption clause 
the revolving bank facility contains various covenants which  among other things  requires the maintenance of financial ratios a consolidated maximum total debt coverage ratio  and  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as at january  the consolidated maximum debt coverage ratio is computed as consolidated total debt divided by net income excluding net income of vies and before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and net of discrete non cash losses and gains or extraordinary losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business the denominator 
consolidated total debt the numerator primarily includes without duplication all liabilities for borrowed money  capital lease obligations  letters of credit whether or not related to borrowed money  the net marked to market under swap agreements and guarantee liabilities excluding those scheduled in the revolving bank facility 
the minimum fixed charge coverage is computed as net income excluding net income of vies and before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  rent expense  and net of discrete non cash losses and gains or extraordinary losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business  collectively as the numerator  divided by consolidated fixed charges 
consolidated fixed charges include interest and rent expense 
the following table outlines the level of our covenant compliance for fiscal under the revolving bank facility actual required consolidated total debt to ebitda minimum fixed charge consolidated total debt to ebitda cannot exceed 
minimum fixed charge cannot be less than 
the revolving bank facility contains certain covenants that will limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  create liens  merge with other entities  sell assets  make restricted payments  make certain investments  loans  advances  guarantees or acquisitions  change the nature of our business  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into certain restrictive agreements  or pay dividends or make share repurchases if we are not in compliance with the financial covenants  or if such transactions would cause us to not be in compliance with the financial covenants 

table of contents events of default under the revolving bank facility include a default in the payment of the obligations under the revolving bank facility or a change in control of tim hortons inc additionally  events of default for the borrower  tdl or any future guarantor include a breach of any representation  warranty or covenant under the revolving bank facility  certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation  and  any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds million 
on september   the tim hortons advertising and promotion fund canada inc ad fund entered into a million revolving credit facility to be used to finance the acquisition and installation of lcd screens  media engines  drive thru menu boards and ancillary equipment in our restaurants 
at the end of fiscal  approximately million of this facility had been drawn upon 
the facility is not guaranteed by tim hortons inc or any of its subsidiaries and is secured by the ad fund s assets 
the loan facility matures december   at which point  the ad fund currently intends to refinance this facility 
comparative cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million 
strong earnings during both fiscal and fiscal were the primary drivers of operating cash flows 
the decrease year over year was primarily driven by working capital movements  mainly attributable to the timing of accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and taxes 
we had a number of significant payments earlier in fiscal from accounts payables and accrued liabilities with the distribution of the majority of our million allocation to restaurant owners related to the sale of maidstone bakeries  tim card redemptions that were not offset by a reduction in restricted cash and cash equivalents as million of restricted investments matured and are reflected in investing activities below 
we also had fiscal tax payments  including cash taxes of approximately million related to the sale of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries  which were remitted in early fiscal we do not expect working capital changes to be of such significance in future years as those changes experienced in fiscal and fiscal were generally specific to the sale of maidstone bakeries 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million provided from investing activities in fiscal  representing a decrease of million 
the decrease year over year was due primarily to the gross proceeds received from the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries of million  offset by million of cash and cash equivalents held by maidstone bakeries and deconsolidated at the time of sale 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal increased capital spending year over year related primarily to our increased development of standard and non standard restaurants and spending related to our new replacement distribution facility in kingston  which added frozen and refrigerated distribution capabilities in addition to existing dry goods capabilities 
additionally  we received million in proceeds from the sale of restricted investments  while other investing activities required million in fiscal comparatively  million was required for a net purchase of restricted investments  while million was provided from other investing activities in fiscal 
table of contents capital expenditures are typically the largest ongoing component of our investing activities and include expenditures for new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  and other corporate capital needs 
a summary of capital expenditures for fiscal   and is as follows fiscal years in millions capital expenditures new restaurants existing restaurants replacement distribution facility ad fund new coffee roasting facility other capital needs total capital expenditures capital expenditures for existing restaurants relate primarily to renovations and restaurant replacements

in addition  capital expenditures in fiscal included expenditures related to the completion of our new coffee roasting facility in hamilton  ontario 
capital expenditures for new restaurants by operating segment were as follows fiscal years in millions canada us total we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be between million and million for new restaurant development  remodeling  drive thru enhancements  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
we anticipate these and future capital needs related to our normal business activities will be funded through ongoing operations 
in addition  we will also continue with the installation of digital menu boards  along with new drive thru rotating menu boards  that began late in fiscal to enhance our overall guest experience in our canadian restaurants 
the ad fund will invest up to million on this initiative  which we expect will be funded with primarily third party financing  and will be secured by the ad fund s assets 
financing activities 
financing activities used cash of million in in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we purchased and cancelled million of common shares and paid dividends of million in fiscal compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal our increased spending for financing activities is a direct result of additional share repurchases we made as we deployed the net proceeds received in october from the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries 
our program of up to million  of which approximately million was still available to be purchased as at 
table of contents january   has been funded to date from operating cash flows  cash on hand  and the net proceeds from the maidstone bakeries sale in october  which have been fully deployed 
we currently expect to repurchase approximately million in fiscal under the program prior to its termination on march  in addition  we repaid million of term debt  prior to maturity and without penalty in fiscal this prepayment was made primarily with net proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes 
contractual obligations our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of january  are shown in the following table 
purchase obligations primarily include commitments for purchases for certain food ingredients and advertising expenditures 
payments due by period less than year years years after years total liability recorded on balance sheet future commitment not recorded on balance sheet in thousands contractual obligations long term debt  including interest and current maturities capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations the above table does not reflect uncertain tax position liabilities of million including related interest as the company is unable to make a reasonable reliable estimate when possible cash settlements with a taxing authority would occur refer to note to the consolidated financial statements

included in the purchase obligations outlined above are commitments relating to the following commodities green coffee  sugar  palm soybean oil and wheat 
some of these purchase commitments are made on behalf of third party suppliers  including maidstone bakeries 
we generally purchase to months forward in these commodities  but in periods of rising prices  we may extend these purchase commitments for longer periods 
we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including setting fixed prices with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future  and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
in general  we do not have contracts with our suppliers of commodities that extend greater than twelve months 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements as of january  and january  as that term is described by the sec

table of contents equity income includes income from equity investments in partnerships and joint ventures and other minority investments over which we exercise significant influence  excluding joint ventures that we are required to consolidate 
equity income from these investments is considered to be an integrated part of our business operations and is  therefore  included in operating income

the application of critical accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note of our audited historical consolidated financial statements 
included in our significant accounting policies are certain policies that we believe are both significant and may require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of our operations 
these assumptions and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates and judgments are inherent in  but not limited to  the following income taxes  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of assets and other intangibles and or restaurant closure costs  the estimation of the useful lives of long lived assets  assessing and determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  valuations associated with estimating stock based compensation expense  and reserve contingencies for litigation and various other commitments and contingencies 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates based on new events occurring  additional information being obtained or more experience being acquired 
the following are new accounting standards which have been adopted during the current fiscal year 
effective july   the company adopted asu no 
 a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring  as codified in asc receivables 
the amendments in this update provide additional guidance to assist creditors in determining whether a restructuring of a receivable 
table of contents meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  a creditor must separately conclude that both of the following exist i the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties  and ii the restructuring constitutes a concession 
the adoption of this update has been reflected in our related disclosures see note to the consolidated financial statements 
described below are critical accounting policies which involve a higher degree of judgment and or complexity  and which should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition the timing of revenue recognition for sales distribution  company operating restaurants and vies  and franchise revenues rents  royalties and franchise fees does not involve significant estimates and assumptions 
sales we operate warehouses in canada to distribute coffee  other dry goods and refrigerated and frozen products to an extensive restaurant system 
revenues from these sales are recorded when the product is delivered to the restaurant owners  or in certain cases  where the product is delivered to a third party distributor for sale to restaurant owners or retailers 
revenue from company operated restaurants and non owned restaurant vies is recognized upon tender of payment at the time of sale 
franchise revenues our restaurants are predominantly franchised 
we grant franchise licenses or operator agreements to independent operators who in turn pay franchise fees and other amounts  which typically include payments for equipment  royalties  and in most cases  rent 
franchise fees are collected at the time of sale or extension of franchise rights 
franchise fees and equipment sales are generally recognized as income when each restaurant commences operations and payment is received from the restaurant owner  unless the restaurant owner is participating in our fip 
we generally control  either through ownership or by leasing  a significant majority of the real estate on which our restaurants are located  and we lease the real estate to our restaurant owners 
rental income is recorded on an accrual basis 
most leases with restaurant owners provide for fixed payments with contingent or percentage rent after sales exceed certain levels  while others provide for monthly rent based solely on a percentage of sales 
fixed  or base  rental revenue is recorded on a straight line basis and contingent or percentage rental revenue is recognized when sales exceed certain levels 
royalties  based on a percentage of monthly sales  are recognized as income in the month earned on the accrual basis 
from time to time  the company will record royalty revenue and or contingent rent based on an estimate of the restaurant s sales 
these estimates have historically been materially consistent with actual amounts reported 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method whereby income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for accounting purposes as compared to tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are expected to be realized  except for the amount of earnings related to our foreign operations where repatriation is not contemplated in the foreseeable future 
income taxes reported in the consolidated statement of operations include the current and deferred portions of the expense 
income taxes applicable to items charged or credited to equity are netted with such items 
changes in deferred income taxes related to a change in tax rates are recognized in the period when the tax rate change is enacted 
in addition  the consolidated statement of operations contains items that are non taxable or non deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  cause the income tax provision to be different from what it would be if based on statutory rates 

table of contents when considered necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflect the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
changes in judgment that result in subsequent recognition  derecognition or a change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period including any related interest and penalties are recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs 
we record interest and potential penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we classify a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit as a long term liability except for the liabilities that are expected to be settled within the next months 
property and equipment we carry our property and equipment at cost 
depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or lease terms 
we estimate useful lives based on historical data and industry trends 
we monitor our capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
changes in the planned use  or legal  contractual or estimated useful lives of these assets may result in accelerated depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and tested for impairment whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicates impairment may exist triggering event  which may include a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of prior to its estimated useful life 
restaurant related long lived assets are grouped into operating markets as this is the lowest identifiable level of independent cash flows 
events such as prolonged negative same store sales growth in the operating market  which is a key operating metric  or prolonged negative cash flows in the operating market  are indicators that we use in evaluating whether an impairment may exist 
we also test for impairment if we have a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in any one market 
we also consider the length of time we have been in the market as it takes time to fully establish a market 
the impairment analysis of the triggering events described above differs depending upon whether the affected market is considered a developed market or a developing market 
in developed markets  one of the key indicators for the overall health of an operating market is same store sales growth 
in developing markets  we assess a number of factors  including systemwide sales growth  which includes both new restaurants and same store sales growth  the stage of growth of the operating market  the average unit sales volume trends  overall long term performance expectations  as well as higher than normal restaurant closures in a market 
non restaurant related assets are grouped based on their ability to generate independent cash flows 
in the case of our manufacturing facilities  they are grouped on a facility by facility basis 
corporate assets  which relate primarily to land  buildings  and computer hardware and software systems  are grouped on a consolidated level with all long lived assets as they support the entire business and independent cash flows are not generated from these specific assets 

table of contents if it is determined that a triggering event has occurred  an undiscounted cash flow analysis is completed on the affected market to determine if the future expected cash flows of a market are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
a key assumption within our undiscounted cash flow analysis is estimated same store sales growth 
if it is determined that the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient  then the market is deemed to be impaired 
in addition  if our estimates or underlying assumptions change  we may be required to record an impairment in the future 
the fair value of the property and equipment is estimated using primarily third party appraisals or the discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
reserve contingencies for litigation and other matters in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of reasonably possible obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimation process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates and adjustments to income could be required 
variable interest entities we analyze our variable interests  including our equity investments and certain license or operator arrangements with various entities 
we determine our interests in vies  and then assess whether we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of these vies 
if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary  we then consolidate the vie s assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows 
we estimate the assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses of certain vies where financial information is not available from other sources 
if we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for such interests using other applicable gaap 
we enter into lease arrangements with certain operators who are not required to invest a significant amount of capital 
in addition  us restaurant owners participating in the fip fip restaurant owner do not have a significant amount of initial capital invested that is not financed directly by us 
the legal entity within which such an operator or fip restaurant owner operates is considered not to be adequately capitalized  and therefore  that entity is considered a vie 
based on management s review of the financial statements it receives from these operators and fip restaurant owners  the projections performed by the company indicate that we are  in some instances  the primary beneficiary of expected returns or losses of these vies 
vies for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary have no impact on our reported consolidated net income attributable to thi or eps 
there are a small percentage of restaurants considered to be vies in which we hold a significant variable interest  but for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this small percentage of franchised restaurants is nominal 
we have no equity interest in any of our restaurant owners 
none of our assets serve as collateral for the consolidated restaurants  and creditors of these vies have no recourse to us 
stock based compensation our employee stock based compensation plan allows for a broad range of equity based compensation awards  including in the form of restricted stock units rsus  stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  dividend equivalent rights ders  performance awards and share awards 
we currently provide compensation to certain employees in the form of rsus and stock options with tandem sars 
in addition  we issue deferred stock units dsus to our directors under our non employee director deferred stock unit plan 
restricted stock units rsus and performance conditioned rsus are measured at the fair market value based on the closing price of our common shares traded on the toronto stock exchange on the first business day preceding the grant date 
rsus are expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period except for grants to retirement eligible employees  which are expensed immediately 
performance conditioned rsus are expensed on a straight line basis beginning when the performance measures are set and extends over the vesting period or 
table of contents to the grant date for retirement eligible employees  based on management s determination that the achievement of the performance condition for the planned grants is probable 
since the awards are settled with common shares  the award is accounted for using the equity method 
deferred stock units dsus are granted to non employee members of our board of directors and are expensed on the date of grant since they vest immediately  although they are not payable until a director s separation from service 
since the awards are settled in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed 
dsus have accompanying ders  which are expensed as earned 
stock options the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model to value outstanding options which requires the use of subjective assumptions  such as the estimated length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them the expected term  and the expected volatility of our common share price over the expected term 
the awards are accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period  and are expensed over the vesting period 
stock options with tandem sars see below granted to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately 
changes in subjective assumptions as well as changes in the share price from period to period  can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
the following assumptions were used in the black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of outstanding stock options sars year ended january  january  expected share price volatility risk free interest rate expected life years years expected dividend yield closing share price stock appreciation rights sars may be granted alone or in conjunction with a stock option 
a sar related to an option terminates upon the expiration  forfeiture  or exercise of the related option  and is exercisable only to the extent that the related option is exercisable 
stock options with tandem sars enable the employee to exercise the stock option to receive common shares or to exercise the sar and receive a cash payment  in each case of a value equal to the difference between the market price of the share on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods  beginning after december  the adoption of this update will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements other than some additional disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments in this 
table of contents update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted and beginning with this annual report  we have re ordered our consolidated financial statements so that the consolidated statement of comprehensive income immediately follows the consolidated statement of operations 
subsequently  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
which defers only those changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments and the effect of those reclassifications on the face of the financial statements 
the adoption of this update  absent the deferral  did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
the amendments in this update will enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments that are either i offset in accordance with applicable gaap  or ii subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar arrangement 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods  beginning on or after january  and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
the company is currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this update may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
impact of accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in february  the sec released commission statement in support of convergence and global accounting standards 
the statement includes a detailed work plan to be executed by the sec staff in its analysis in determining both whether and how to incorporate international financial reporting standards ifrs into the us financial reporting system 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board 
under the proposed roadmap  if the sec incorporates ifrs into the us domestic reporting system  companies could be required to prepare financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with ifrs as early as fiscal as a foreign private issuer  the company is able to apply ifrs earlier if certain approvals are obtained 
subsequently  in may  the sec released a staff paper outlining a possible approach for incorporating ifrs into the us financial reporting system  should the sec decide that such incorporation is in the best interests of us investors 
in july  the sec held a roundtable consisting of investors  regulators and smaller public companies to discuss both the staff paper and the benefits and challenges of incorporating ifrs into the us financial reporting system 
in november  the sec released two additional staff papers i an analysis of ifrs in practice  and  ii a comparison of us gaap and ifrs  both of which are to contribute to the execution of the work plan by presenting the staff s observations regarding consistency of ifrs application and on identifying areas in which the requirements of ifrs and us gaap continue to differ 
the sec has yet to make a decision on if  or how to proceed  with incorporating ifrs 
as such  pending the developments of the sec s work plan  we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ifrs and fasb iasb joint projects would have on the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and disclosures  and we will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 
further  although canadian securities laws generally require canadian reporting issuers to apply ifrs beginning in fiscal  national instrument acceptable accounting principles and auditing 
table of contents standards permits issuers that have a class of securities registered under section of the us securities exchange act of  as amended  the exchange act or are required to file reports under section d of the exchange act and which are not registered or required to be registered as an investment company under the us investment company act of  as amended  to elect to prepare financial statements that are filed with or delivered to a securities regulatory authority or regulator other than acquisition statements in accordance with us gaap 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and inflation 
in accordance with our policies  we manage our exposure to these various market based risks 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
our primary foreign exchange exposure to our cash flows results from purchases by canadian operations in us dollars and payments from canadian operations to us operations 
net cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were approximately million for fiscal in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations when we translate our us operating results into canadian dollars for reporting purposes 
while these fluctuations are not significant to the consolidated operating results  the fluctuations in exchange rates do impact our us segment operating results  and can affect the comparability between quarters and year to year 
also  from time to time  we hold us dollars and other us dollar net positions in canadian dollar functional currency entities to support our business needs 
the holding of us dollar net positions in these entities can cause foreign exchange gains and losses which are included in other expense income  net  and can  therefore  affect our earnings 
we seek to manage significant cash flows and net income exposures related to exchange rate changes between these two currencies 
we may use derivative products to reduce the risk of a significant impact on our cash flows or net income 
forward currency contracts are entered into to reduce some of the risk related to purchases paid for by the canadian operations in us dollars  such as coffee  and certain intercompany purchases 
we do not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
we have a policy forbidding speculating in foreign currency 
by their nature  derivative financial instruments involve risk  including the credit risk of non performance by counterparties  and our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
to minimize this risk  except in certain circumstances  we limit the notional amount per counterparty to a maximum of million 
we have reviewed counterparty risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
forward currency contracts to sell canadian dollars and buy us million and us million were outstanding as of january  and january   respectively  primarily as a cash flow hedge for coffee purchases from third parties  including intercompany purchases 
the fair value unrealized gain on these forward contracts was million as of january   compared to an unrealized loss of million as of january  at the current level of annual operating income generated from our us operations and current us dollar cash flow exposures  if the us currency rate changes by the entire year  the annual impact on our net income and annual cash flows would not be material 
commodity risk we purchase certain products such as coffee  wheat  edible oil and sugar and other prepared products  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices  in the normal course of business 
therefore  we are exposed to some price volatility related to weather and  more importantly  various other market conditions outside of our 
table of contents control 
however  we do employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally  these techniques include setting fixed prices for periods of up to one year with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future  and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
we purchase a significant amount of green coffee and typically have purchase commitments fixing the price for a minimum of to months depending upon prevailing market conditions 
we also typically hedge against the risk of foreign exchange on green coffee prices at the same time 
we do not make use of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of our other contract pricing techniques outlined above 
as we make purchases beyond our current commitments  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions 
increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to restaurant owners  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
we and our restaurant owners have some ability to increase product pricing to offset a rise in commodity prices  subject to acceptance by restaurant owners and customers 
these cost and pricing changes can impact revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
see item a 
risk factors increases in the cost of commodities or decreases in the availability of commodities could have an adverse impact on our restaurant owners and on our business and financial results 
interest rate risk in fiscal  we issued million of senior notes  which were offered on a private placement basis in canada with a term of years 
net proceeds from the senior notes were primarily used to prepay million of our existing term debt  prior to maturity 
the senior notes bear a fixed coupon interest rate of  and an effective rate of resulting from the settlement of interest rate forwards used to hedge the interest rate prior to the issuance of the first portion of the senior notes  premium recorded on the subsequent issue of senior notes and the deferred financing fees associated with the issuances 
as our cash is invested in short term variable rate instruments  we are now exposed on a net basis to interest rate movements on a net asset position when historically we have been exposed on a net liability position 
if interest rates change by basis points  the impact on our annual net income would not be material 
we have a million revolving bank facility that was undrawn at the end of fiscal  other than to support standby letters of credit 
if we were to borrow on this facility in the future  we may be exposed to interest rate risk on a net liability position at that time 
inflation consolidated financial statements determined on an historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for our business inventories approximate current market prices  property holdings at fixed costs are substantial  and there is some ability to adjust prices 
however  if several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time  such as commodity price increases beyond our ability to control and increased labour costs  we and our restaurant owners may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand
