overview we are a life sciences company that has developed and commercialized a dna sequencing platform for whole human genome sequencing and analysis 
our goal is to become the preferred solution for whole human genome sequencing and analysis 
our complete genomics analysis platform  or cga platform  combines our proprietary human genome sequencing technology with our advanced informatics and data management software and our innovative  end to end  outsourced service model to provide our customers with data that is immediately ready to be used for genome based research 
we believe that our solution can provide academic  biopharmaceutical  and translational medicine researchers with whole human genome data and analysis at an unprecedented combination of quality  cost and scale without requiring them to invest in in house sequencing instruments  high performance computing resources and specialized personnel 
by removing these constraints and broadly enabling researchers to conduct large scale complete human genome studies  we believe that our solution has the potential to advance medical research and expand understanding of the basis  treatment and prevention of complex diseases 
we have targeted our complete human genome sequencing service at academic  governmental and other research institutions  as well as biopharmaceutical and healthcare organizations 
in the dna sequencing industry  whole human genome sequencing is generally deemed to be coverage of at least of the nucleotides in the genome 
we perform our sequencing service at our mountain view  california headquarters facility  which began commercial operation in may in the near term  we expect to make significant expenditures related to the expansion of our mountain view sequencing facility and our research and development initiatives  as well as to increase our sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses to support our commercial operations and anticipated growth 
in future years  we may construct additional genome centers in the united states and in other strategic markets to accommodate an expected growing  global demand for high quality  low cost whole human genome sequencing on a large scale 
our ability to generate revenue  and the timing of our revenue  will depend on generating new orders and contracts  receiving qualified dna samples from customers and the rate at which we can convert our backlog of sequencing orders into completed and delivered data and the price per genome contracted with the customer 
we define backlog as the number of genomes for which customers have placed orders that we believe are firm and for which no revenue has yet been recorded 
as of december   we had a backlog of orders for sequencing over  genomes 
the speed with which we can convert orders into revenue depends principally on the speed with which our customers provide us with qualified samples after submitting an order  the rate at which our system can sequence a genome  and the rate at which all significant contractual obligations are fulfilled 

table of contents changes in these variables will cause our results of operations to fluctuate  perhaps significantly 
in addition  we are rapidly developing and implementing new generations of sample preparation handling and automation processes  sequencing instruments  and information analysis and storage systems 
as a result  we have a very limited history to guide us in predicting variables like equipment failure  throughput yield  customer delivery of qualified genomic samples and other factors that could affect revenue 
we also experience delays from time to time due to challenges in implementing these new processes and systems 
we have not been profitable in any period since we were formed 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and we recognized revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we believe that  based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  our cash and cash equivalents balances  our term loans and interest income we earn on these balances  will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the twelve months beyond the december  balance sheet 
our recurring operating losses and negative cashflow from operations and our requirement for additional funding to execute our business objectives beyond this period gives rise to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
although we do not anticipate any material seasonal effects  given our limited operating history as a revenue generating company  our sales cycle is uncertain 
in  pfizer inc and the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
if demand for our services expands as expected  we do not anticipate that the loss of any individual customer would have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
in november  we closed the initial public offering of our common stock  in connection with which we sold  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from this transaction 
on june   we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share and received net proceeds of approximately million from this transaction 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable periods 
management bases its estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements  which  in turn  could materially change the results from those reported 
our management evaluates its estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
however  if our assumptions change  we may need to revise our estimates  or take other corrective actions  either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from selling our human genome sequencing services 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
upon completion of the sequencing process  we ship or make available the research ready genomic data to the customer 
we use shipping documents and third party evidence to verify shipment of the data 
in order to determine whether collectability is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the 
table of contents customer 
if we determine that collectability is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collectability becomes reasonably assured 
through a signed contract  which may be in the form of a signed agreement or purchase order  we establish persuasive evidence of an arrangement with our customers and whether there is a fixed and determinable price 
the contract outlines terms and conditions to determine our obligations associated with the contract 
revenue is recognized  net of discounts and incentives  when the individual genomic data is shipped or made available to customers and upon satisfaction of our obligations 
if we have not satisfied our obligations as outlined in the terms and conditions of the contract  revenue is deferred until these obligations are satisfied 
in certain circumstances  we may agree to contract modifications prior to our fulfillment of an arrangement and recognition of related revenue 
in these instances  the modifications are accounted for as additional contract obligations or deliverables 
revenue is then allocated to the modified deliverables and recognized when the four general revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we also receive down payments from customers prior to the commencement of the genome sequencing process 
any down payments received are recorded as deferred revenue until we meet all revenue recognition criteria 
in the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements which amended existing accounting guidance for revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
simultaneously  we created a dedicated customer support team 
we applied the provisions asu on a prospective basis to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified since the beginning of in general  our multiple element arrangements provide for delivery of research ready genomic data and technical customer support 
we have evaluated the allocation of the arrangement consideration to our deliverables using the relative selling price hierarchy required in asu of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence tpe or our best estimate of selling price esp 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
we typically are not able to determine vsoe for an element because a substantial majority of the selling prices for our services do not fall within a reasonably narrow range 
tpe is determined based on a competitor s price for similar deliverables when sold separately 
we typically are not able to determine tpe as we are unable to reliably determine competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
therefore  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration to our genome sequencing data and our technical support services 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would enter into a transaction with the customer if the service were to be sold by us on a standalone basis 
specifically  for such price determination  we consider the cost to provide the service  the targeted margin on that service  the economic conditions and trends  and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
the revenue related to the technical customer support service is recognized on a straight line basis  beginning from the date the revenue related to the delivery of the genome sequencing data is recognized  over the time period during which the technical support services are provided 
estimated useful lives of property and equipment we depreciate our property and equipment using a straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our property primarily consists of lease improvements  and our equipment primarily consists of our sequencing instruments and computer equipment used in the sequencing process 
while we use our best judgment  based on the useful lives observed for similar technological assets  to determine the useful lives of our sequencing instruments and computer equipment  a significant change in technology or the emergence of an advanced technology could result in a shorter useful life than we initially anticipated 
our equipment represents the largest asset on our balance sheet  and a subsequent reduction in the useful lives of equipment could have a material impact on our statement of operations 

table of contents inventory inventory consists of the raw materials we use in our sequencing process  work in process and finished goods 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using standard costs  which approximate actual costs  on a first in  first out basis 
market value is determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventories  giving consideration to potential obsolescence  our product life cycle and development plans  product expiration and quality issues 
we anticipate these estimates to increase in significance as our sequencing volumes increase as expected 
valuation of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets for impairment every year in the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we test for recoverability by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against future net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected discounted future net cash flows arising from the assets 
we make estimates and judgments about future undiscounted cash flows and fair values 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans  there is significant exercise of judgment involved in determining the cash flow attributable to a long lived asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
our estimates of anticipated cash flows could be reduced significantly in the future 
as a result  the carrying amounts of our long lived assets could be reduced through impairment charges in the future 
there have been no such impairments of long lived assets to date 
however  we anticipate that a future impairment could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in light of the dollar significance of the long lived assets carried on our balance sheet 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights  or awards  based on the estimated fair value of the awards granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
we also use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of nonemployee stock option grants 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  the fair value of nonemployee stock option grants is re measured as they vest  and the resulting increase or decrease in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of our expected stock price volatility  the expected life of the awards  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
determining these assumptions requires significant judgment 
we determined the expected life and volatility rate of the employee stock option grants based on that of publicly traded companies in the dna sequencing  diagnostics or personalized medicine industries 
when selecting the public companies in these industries to be used in the volatility calculation  we selected companies with comparable characteristics to us  including enterprise value and financial leverage  and removed companies with significantly higher enterprise values  lower risk profiles or established positions within their applicable industry 
we also selected companies with historical share price volatility information sufficient to meet the expected life of our stock options 
the historical volatility data was computed using the daily closing prices for the selected companies shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stock options 
along with using the data of comparable peer companies  we will continue to analyze our own historical expected term and stock price volatility assumptions as more historical data for our own options and common stock  respectively  becomes available 
we determined the expected volatility of our stock purchase rights based on our stock price volatility over the six month life of those rights 
the expected life of the nonemployee option grants was based on their remaining contractual life at the measurement date 
the risk free interest rate assumption was based on us treasury instruments whose terms were consistent with the option s expected life 
the expected dividend assumption was based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 

table of contents in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation  we only record stock based compensation expense for stock option awards that are expected to vest 
as a result  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures may differ 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our statements of operations could be materially impacted when we record a true up for the difference 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
recognition of deferred tax assets is appropriate when realization of such assets is more likely than not 
we recognize a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
we adopted the new authoritative guidance to account for uncertain tax positions 
none of our currently unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective income tax rate if recognized  due to the valuation allowance that currently offsets our deferred tax assets 
we do not anticipate the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at december  will significantly increase or decrease in the next months 
we assess all material positions taken in any income tax return  including all significant uncertain positions  in all tax years that are still subject to assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities 
assessing an uncertain tax position begins with the initial determination of the position s sustainability and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
as of each balance sheet date  unresolved uncertain tax positions must be reassessed  and we will determine whether the factors underlying the sustainability assertion have changed  and the amount of the recognized tax benefit is still appropriate 
the recognition and measurement of tax benefits requires significant judgment 
judgments concerning the recognition and measurement of a tax benefit might change as new information becomes available 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
in addition  as of december   we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
in addition  as of december   we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire in  if not used  and the state research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire 
because of the net operating loss and credit carryforwards  all of our tax years  dating to inception in  remain open to federal tax examinations 
most state tax jurisdictions have four open tax years at any point in time 
under federal and similar state tax statutes  substantial changes in our ownership  may limit our ability to use our available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the annual limitation  as a result of a change in control  may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
we conducted an analysis 
table of contents through december  to determine whether ownership changes occurred 
we concluded that three ownership changes had occurred 
however  as of december   we believe no net operating losses and million or research and development tax credits will expire unused as a result of these changes

change change revenue costs and expenses costs of revenue start up production costs research and development general and administrative sales and marketing total operating expenses loss from operations interest expense interest and other income expense  net net loss result is not meaningful revenue during  we recognized million of revenue  compared to million during as a result of continued market adoption of complete human genome sequencing and our expanded marketing and sales activities over the past year  we sequenced significantly more genomes during than we did during however  the prices for our genome sequencing service have declined significantly during thereby partially offsetting the increase in sequenced genomes 
our quarterly revenue was million  million  million and million in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
we recognized revenues for over  over  over and over genomes in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
our revenues in the third and fourth quarters were lower than revenues in the first and second quarters due to lower average selling prices of delivered genomes in the last two quarters of and a delay that we experienced in scaling up our sample preparation and library preparation capacity in the fourth quarter  which resulted in a delay in completing sequencing orders 
costs of revenue before the commercialization of our technology platform for our human genome sequencing services in may  our costs of revenue were presented as start up production costs 
by  our processes were sufficiently mature to shift to a traditional cost of revenue presentation 
during  we incurred million of costs to provide our genome sequencing service 
the million of cost of revenue primarily consisted of million in salary  benefits and overhead  million in equipment depreciation and million in materials 

table of contents we anticipate that these costs as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate as we increase sequencing capacity  our capacity utilization changes  the sequencing prices we charge to our customers change and as we continue to improve and automate our human genome sequencing processes 
however  we anticipate that our total cost of revenue will increase in absolute dollars as we sequence additional genomes and our revenue grows 
start up production costs during  we incurred million of start up production costs to support the development of our genome sequencing service 
the million of cost of revenue primarily consisted of million in salary  benefits and overhead  million in equipment depreciation and million in materials 
research and development during  we recognized million of research and development expenses  compared to million during  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense of million  an increase of million in consulting and outside services and an increase of million in supplies and materials to support development activities 
the increase in salaries and benefits cost is a result of increased headcount and refocusing of certain research and development resources that had been directed to start up production activities in the prior year 
we expect to continue to invest in research and development activities as we seek to enhance our sequencing processes  components and systems to improve the yield and throughput and reduce the cost of our sequencing service 
consequently  we believe that in the near future  our research and development expenses will increase 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of million in employee salaries and benefits  an increase of million in legal fees  an increase of million in recruiting fees and an increase of million in certain expenses related to being a public company such as directors and officers insurance  board of director fees and accounting fees 
the increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support operations as a public company 
the increase in legal expense is primarily related to our ongoing litigation with illumina 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in to support our operations as a growing public company and ongoing litigation with illumina 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million during  compared to million during  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is due primarily to an increase in employee salaries and benefits expense of million  an increase in consulting and outside services expense of million  an increase in marketing activities of million and an increase of million in stock based compensation 
the increase in expenses was primarily a result of the growth of our sales and marketing organization to support the increased sales activity and overall growth of the company 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase during as we increase our headcount for sales and marketing personnel to expand our customer base and to generate growth in terms of both whole human genomes ordered and revenues 
interest expense during and  we incurred interest expense of million and million  respectively 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  was an expense of million for compared to an expense of million for the decreased expense in was primarily due to the change in the fair value of our warrant liability 
comparison of the years ended december  and during the year ended december   our results of operations were impacted by the following events  which should be considered when reading the discussion of our results of operations comparing and in  we initiated start up production activities using resources from our research and development organization 
using these research and development resources for production activities decreased research and development expenses during by million 
in the second quarter of  we implemented temporary cost reduction initiatives to conserve cash in light of macroeconomic conditions 
the temporary cost reduction initiatives included a salary reduction for all company employees that averaged approximately 
the impact of the temporary cost reduction initiatives on operating results was a reduction of expenses of approximately million  including reductions in employee salaries and benefits of approximately million  consulting and outside engineering services of approximately million and prototype equipment expenses of approximately million 
as a result of these cost reduction initiatives  research and development  general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses decreased million  million and million  respectively  during during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated the expected useful lives of our equipment and determined that for certain of our equipment the useful life should be shortened 
accordingly  we accelerated depreciation of this equipment  resulting in an additional million in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter of of this million charge  approximately million was recorded as start up production costs and approximately million was recorded as research and development expense 
during  we did not have equipment that required acceleration of depreciation

the million increase in start up production costs was primarily due to increases in employee salaries and benefits and stock based compensation expenses of million and million  respectively  depreciation expense of million  facilities and maintenance expense of million  and consulting expense of million 
we continued to incur start up costs in excess of revenue during to initiate and bring our human genome sequencing production process to commercial scale 
research and development during  we recognized million of research and development expenses  compared to million during  representing a decrease of million  or 
while there was only a change in research and development expenses between the two periods  there were changes in the composition of the expenses 
the primary changes during compared to were a reduction in depreciation expense of million  an increase in salaries and benefits expense and stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  and an increase in facilities and maintenance costs of million 
the decrease in depreciation expense was primarily due to the acceleration of depreciation expense of certain equipment in and the redeployment of equipment to start up production activities 
the increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to a charge associated with an equity grant to one of our founders in and the temporary cost reduction initiatives implemented during the second quarter of  which resulted in lower overall salaries and benefits expense for the increase in facilities and maintenance costs was associated with the expansion of our facilities during general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for  compared to million for  representing an increase of million  or

the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to an increase in employee salaries and benefits of million and an increase in outside services of million 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses was also impacted by increases in travel expenses and allocation of facilities and maintenance costs of million each 
the increase in expenses was primarily a result of the growth of our sales and marketing organization to support the increased sales activity and overall order growth in interest expense during  we incurred interest expense of million  compared to million during the decrease in interest expense was primarily a result of lower amortization of the debt discount related to the common stock warrants issued in  compared to amortization of the debt discount related to the series d preferred stock warrants issued in the series d preferred stock warrants were issued in the first quarter of while the common stock warrants were issued during the second quarter of  resulting in a shorter period of amortization during versus

liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have generated operating losses in every quarter  resulting in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we have financed our operations to date primarily through private placements of preferred stock and promissory notes  borrowings under our credit facilities  proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings and term debt 
as of december   we had working capital of million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
as of december   working capital was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
cash in excess of immediate operating requirements is invested primarily in money market funds and short term investments in accordance with our investment policy  primarily with the goals of capital preservation and liquidity maintenance 
we believe that  based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  our cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances  including interest income we earn on those balances  will not be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the twelve months beyond the december  balance sheet 
our requirement for additional funding to execute our business objectives beyond this period gives rise to substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
additional sources of capital  which are not in place at this time  may be from the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in a public or private offering  from an additional credit facility  or strategic partnership coupled with an investment in our company or a combination of both 
the report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph stating that our recurring losses from operations and significant negative cash flow from operations raise substantial doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities  or other debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations 
the issuance of any equity securities will also dilute our current stockholders 
there is no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional financing on terms that are acceptable  if at all 
given the risks associated with our business  including our limited operating history and our new business model in an emerging industry  and recent difficulties for life sciences companies raising funds in the capital markets  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise additional capital in the amounts we require  if at all 
if we fail to raise additional capital  and in sufficient amounts  our ability to operate our business beyond the twelve month period stated above and to meet our long term business objectives will be significantly impaired

the significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities include an increase in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventory of million 
the increase in deferred revenue was due to increased advance billing arrangements during the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily due to compensation and benefits including increased sales commissions and bonuses  and employee deposits for our employee stock purchase program that began in may of net cash used in operating activities was million during and consisted of a net loss of million  offset by noncash items of million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of million

the significant items in the change in operating assets and liabilities include a decrease in prepaid expenses of million  an increase in deferred revenue of million and increases in inventory and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in prepaid expenses was due to the use of fully refundable short term deposits in to order components used in the construction of sequencers whose specifications were validated during the increase in inventory was due to materials inventory purchases and work in process to support customer orders

the significant changes in operating assets and liabilities include increases in deferred rent of million  accounts payable of million and deferred revenue of million  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the significant change in deferred rent was due to the difference between rent amounts paid and amounts expensed during on our facility  while the significant increase in prepaid expenses is due to making fully refundable short term deposits for components used in the construction of sequencers whose specifications were undetermined 
the increase in accounts payable during was due to increased purchases associated with the start up of our production facilities during the fourth quarter of the increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were due to revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of and advance billing arrangements with customers

operating and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and we expect this trend to continue as our cash expenditures will remain significant in the short term 
we plan to fund our short term liquidity requirements using cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  including interest income earned on those balances 
at january   our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund our operating losses  to fund our working capital for commercial operations  including personnel costs and other operating expense  to expand the sample preparation  sequencing and computing capacity in our mountain view and santa clara leased facilities  to finance the further research and development of our sequencing technology and services  to finance sales and marketing activities  and to service our debt obligations 
we have a capital intensive business model and we forecast investing approximately million in additional capital during in addition  as a public company we also incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our business and build our infrastructure 

table of contents in addition to our continued expenditures for the expansion of our mountain view sequencing facility  further development of our sequencing technology and services  and expansion of our sales and marketing activities  our principal long term liquidity needs are to fund our working capital for commercial operations  including any growth in working capital required by growth in our business  to finance the possible development of additional sequencing centers  and to service our debt obligations 
the timing and amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the financial success of our genome sequencing business  our ability to increase the genome sequencing capacity in our mountain view facility  whether we are successful in obtaining payments from customers  whether we can enter into collaborations and establish a recurring customer base  the progress and scope of our research and development projects  the filing  prosecution and enforcement of patent claims  the rate at which we establish possible additional genome sequencing centers  if any  and whether we can find suitable partners with which to establish those centers  the effect of any joint ventures or acquisitions of other businesses or technologies that we may enter into or make in the future  and lawsuits brought against us by third parties 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative  sales and marketing and research and development activities are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under the caption risk factors 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect
