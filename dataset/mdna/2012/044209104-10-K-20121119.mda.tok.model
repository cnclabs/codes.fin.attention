under the sale agreement  each originator will transfer  on an ongoing basis  substantially all of its accounts receivable  certain related assets and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to cvg 
under the terms of the transfer and administration agreement  cvg may  from time to time  obtain up to million in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of ashland and its subsidiaries from the conduit investors  the uncommitted investors and or the committed investors through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable  related assets and collections 
the transfer and administration agreement has a term of three years  but is extendable at the discretion of the investors 
ashland will account for the securitization facility as secured borrowings  and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable 
fundings under the transfer and administration agreement will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected  with new fundings being advanced through daily reinvestments as new accounts receivable are originated by the originators and transferred to cvg  with settlement generally occurring monthly 
ashland continues to classify any borrowings under this facility as a short term debt instrument within the consolidated balance sheets 
once sold to cvg  the accounts receivable  related assets and rights to collection described above will be separate and distinct from each originator s own assets and will not be available to its creditors should such originator become insolvent 
substantially all of cvg s assets have been pledged to the agent in support of its obligations under the transfer and administration agreement

such measurements are not prepared in accordance with us gaap and as related to pro forma adjustments  contain ashland s best estimates of cost allocations and shared resource costs 
management believes the use of non gaap measures on a consolidated and business segment basis assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance by presenting comparable financial results between periods 
the non gaap information provided is used by ashland management and may not be determined in a manner consistent with the methodologies used by other companies 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide a supplemental presentation of ashland s operating performance on a consolidated and business segment basis

in addition  certain financial covenants related to ashland s senior credit facility are based on similar non gaap measures and are defined further in the sections that reference this metric 
ashland has included free cash flow as an additional non gaap metric of cash flow generation 
ashland believes free cash flow is relevant because capital expenditures are an important element of ashland s ongoing cash activities  and dividends  while discretionary  have and will likely continue to be an ongoing part of ashland s business operation 
by deducting these amounts from operating cash flows  ashland is able to provide a better indication of the ongoing cash being generated that is ultimately available for both debt and equity holders as well as other investment opportunities

results of operations business segment review as previously discussed  ashland s businesses are managed along four industry segments specialty ingredients  water technologies  performance materials and consumer markets 
results of ashland s business segments are presented based on its management structure and internal accounting practices 
the structure and practices are specific to ashland  therefore  the financial results of ashland s business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other comparable companies 
ashland allocates all costs to its business segments except for certain significant company wide restructuring activities  such as certain restructuring plans described in note f of notes to consolidated financial statements  and other costs or adjustments that relate to former businesses that ashland no longer operates  as well as certain components of pension and other postretirement costs 
ashland refines its expense allocation methodologies to the reportable segments from time to time as internal accounting practices are improved  more refined information becomes available and businesses change 
revisions to ashland s methodologies that are deemed insignificant are applied on a prospective basis 
the ebitda and adjusted ebitda amounts presented within this business section are provided as a means to enhance the understanding of financial measurements that ashland has internally determined to be relevant measures of comparison for each segment 
each of these non gaap measures is defined as follows ebitda operating income plus depreciation and amortization  adjusted ebitda ebitda adjusted for key items  which may include pro forma effects for significant acquisitions or divestitures  as applicable  and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda  which may include pro forma adjustments  divided by sales or sales adjusted for pro forma results 
ashland does not allocate items to each business segment below operating income  such as interest expense and income taxes 
as a result  business segment ebitda and adjusted ebitda are reconciled directly to operating income since it is the most directly comparable us gaap measure 
change in accounting policy regarding pension and other postretirement benefits during  ashland elected to change its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
previously  ashland recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized the gains and losses into operating results over the average future service period of active employees within the related plans 
ashland has elected to immediately m recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense will be recorded on a quarterly basis 
while ashland s previous policy of recognizing pension and other postretirement benefit expense is considered acceptable under us gaap  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results 
this change also improved transparency within ashland s operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred 
this change in accounting policy has been applied retrospectively  adjusting all periods prior to in connection with this change in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits  ashland also elected to change its method of accounting for certain costs included in inventory 
ashland has elected to exclude the amount of its pension and other postretirement benefit costs applicable to inactive participants from inventoriable costs and charge them directly to cost of sales 
while ashland s previous policy of including all pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a component of inventoriable costs was acceptable  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable  as inventoriable costs will include costs that are directly attributable to current employees within cost of sales 
applying this change in retrospectively  in connection with the change in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs  did not have a significant impact on previously reported inventory  cost of sales or segment reported results in any of the prior period financial statements 
in addition  as a further attempt to properly match actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring  ashland changed its expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during previously  ashland allocated all components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses to each business segment on a ratable basis 
ashland now allocates only the service cost component of these plans to the business segment that incurred this expense 
all other pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense components are recorded within the unallocated and other reporting segment 
ashland believes the revised expense allocation will more appropriately match the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment 
the prior year financial information disclosed in the following tables for each business segment reflects the retrospective application of this expense allocation change 
the following table shows sales  operating income and statistical operating information by business segment for each of the last three years ended september m in millions sales specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets operating income loss specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets unallocated and other depreciation and amortization specialty ingredients water technologies performance materials consumer markets unallocated and other operating information specialty ingredients a b sales per shipping day metric tons sold thousands gross profit as a percent of sales water technologies a sales per shipping day gross profit as a percent of sales performance materials a b sales per shipping day metric tons sold thousands gross profit as a percent of sales consumer markets a lubricant sales gallons premium lubricants percent of us branded volumes gross profit as a percent of sales a sales are defined as sales and operating revenues

debt issued in in july  ashland commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the premium million aggregate principal of the senior notes 
in conjunction with this tender offer  ashland issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured  unsubordinated notes due the proceeds of the new notes  together with available cash  were used to pay the consideration  accrued and unpaid interest and related fees and expenses in connection with ashland s cash tender offer of the senior notes 
at the close of the tender offer  million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes was redeemed by ashland  representing of the old notes 
in addition  a redemption premium of million was paid to the former note holders 
on august   ashland entered into a million accounts receivable securitization facility pursuant to i a sale agreement  among ashland and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries each an originator and collectively  the originators and cvg capital iii llc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary of the originators cvg and ii a transfer and administration agreement  among cvg  each originator  ashland  as master servicer  certain conduit investors  uncommitted investors  letter of credit issuers  managing agents  administrators and committed investors  and the bank of nova scotia  as agent for various secured parties the agent 
under the sale agreement  each originator will sell  on an ongoing basis  substantially all of its accounts receivable  certain related assets and the right to the collections on those accounts receivable to cvg 
under the terms of the transfer and administration agreement  cvg may  from time to time  obtain up to million in the form of cash or letters of credit for the benefit of ashland and its subsidiaries from the conduit investors  the uncommitted investors and or the committed investors through the sale of an undivided interest in such accounts receivable  related assets and collections 
the transfer and administration agreement has a term of three years  but is extendable at the discretion of the investors 
ashland will account for the securitization facility as secured borrowings  and the receivables sold pursuant to the facility are included in the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable 
fundings under the transfer and administration agreement will be repaid as accounts receivable are collected  with new fundings being advanced through daily reinvestments as new accounts receivable are originated by the originators and m sold to cvg  with settlement generally occurring monthly 
ashland continues to classify any borrowings under this facility as a short term debt instrument within the consolidated balance sheets 
once sold to cvg  the accounts receivable  related assets and rights to collection described above will be separate and distinct from each originator s own assets and will not be available to its creditors should such originator become insolvent 
substantially all of cvg s assets have been pledged to the agent in support of its obligations under the transfer and administration agreement 
in addition  the originators equity interests in cvg have been pledged to the lenders under the senior credit facility 
at september   the outstanding amount of accounts receivable sold by ashland to cvg was million 
ashland had drawn million under the facility as of september  in available funding from qualifying receivables 
funds drawn at the inception of the accounts receivable securitization facility were used to prepay million of principal on ashland s term loan b facility 
the weighted average interest rate for this instrument was during debt covenant restrictions the senior credit facility contains certain usual and customary representations and warranties  and usual and customary affirmative and negative covenants which include financial covenants for leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  limitations on liens  additional indebtedness  further negative pledges  investments  payment of dividends  mergers  sale of assets and restricted payments  and other customary limitations 
as of september   ashland is in compliance with all debt agreement covenant restrictions 
the maximum consolidated leverage ratios permitted under the current senior credit facility are as follows as of september   from the period december  through september  and as of december  and each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the senior credit facility defines the consolidated leverage ratio as the ratio of consolidated indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents to consolidated ebitda covenant adjusted ebitda for any measurement period 
in general  the senior credit facility defines covenant adjusted ebitda as net income plus consolidated interest charges  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  fees and expenses related to capital market transactions  restructuring and integration charges  noncash stock and equity compensation expense and any other nonrecurring expenses or losses that do not represent a cash item in such period or any future period  less any noncash gains or other items increasing net income 
in general  consolidated indebtedness includes debt plus all purchase money indebtedness  banker s acceptances and bank guaranties  deferred purchase price of property or services  attributable indebtedness and guaranties 
the computation of covenant adjusted ebitda differs from the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda  which have been reconciled previously on page m the minimum required consolidated fixed charge coverage ratios under the current senior credit facility are as of september  and as of december  and each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the senior credit facility defines the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as the ratio of covenant adjusted ebitda less the aggregate amount of all cash capital expenditures to consolidated fixed charges for any measurement period 
in general consolidated fixed charges are defined as the sum of consolidated interest charges  the aggregate principal amount of all regularly scheduled principal payments and the aggregate amount of all restricted payments  which include any dividend or other distribution with respect to any capital stock or other equity interest 
at september   ashland s calculation of the consolidated leverage ratio per the refinancing was compared to the maximum consolidated leverage ratio permitted under ashland s senior credit facility 
at september   ashland s calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio was compared to the minimum required consolidated ratio 
cash projection ashland projects that cash flow from operations and other available financial resources such as cash on hand and revolving credit should be sufficient to meet investing and financing requirements to enable ashland to comply with the covenants and other terms of its financing obligations 
these projections are based on various assumptions that include  but are not limited to operational results  working capital cash generation  capital expenditures  pension funding requirements and tax payment and receipts 
based on ashland s current debt structure included in note i of notes to consolidated financial statements  future annual interest expense is expected to range from approximately million to million based on applicable fixed and floating interest rates  assuming interest rates remain stable 
stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased million since september  to  million at september  this decrease was primarily due to regular cash dividends of million  deferred translation losses of million and unrealized losses on m interest rate swaps of million  partially offset by net income during the year of million  million from common shares issued under stock incentive and other plans and adjustments to pension and postretirement obligations of million 
in march  the board of directors of ashland approved a million stock repurchase program 
under the program that began on april   ashland purchased common shares through a million b automatic trading plan 
effective may   as a result of the announcement of the pending isp acquisition  ashland terminated the b automatic trading program 
purchases under the plan amounted to million  or million shares 
ashland still has the ability to make discretionary purchases of ashland common stock on the open market  pursuant to the board s original million share repurchase authorization 
ashland did not repurchase any shares during or in may  the board of directors of ashland announced a quarterly cash dividend increase to cents per share  cents per share on an annual basis  to eligible shareholders of record 
this amount was paid for quarterly dividends in june and september  and was an increase from the quarterly cash dividend of cents per share paid during the first and second quarters of during the prior year  a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share was paid for the first and second quarters  while cents per share was paid for the third and fourth quarters 
capital expenditures ashland is currently forecasting approximately million of capital expenditures for  funded primarily from operating cash flows 
capital expenditures were million for and averaged million during the last three years  excluding distribution 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations  which is calculated by adding equity to capital investment  as of the end of the last three years follows

e includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt assuming no prepayments 
variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant through the end of the term at rates that existed as of september  f due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities  ashland is unable to determine the timing of payments related to noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties 
therefore  these amounts were included in the more than years column 
g ashland issues various types of letters of credit as part of its normal course of business 
for further information  see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with us gaap 
new accounting pronouncements for a discussion and analysis of recently issued accounting pronouncements and its impact on ashland  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  liabilities and receivables associated with asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets tangible assets the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
buildings are depreciated principally over to years and machinery and equipment principally over to years 
ashland reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that ashland uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
total depreciation expense on property  plant and equipment for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
depreciation expense for  and included million  million and million  m respectively  in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation 
capitalized interest for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
finite lived intangible assets finite lived intangible assets principally consist of certain trademarks and trade names  intellectual property  customer relationships and sales contracts 
these intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the cost of trademarks and trade names is amortized principally over to years  intellectual property over to years  customer relationships over to years and other intangibles over to years 
ashland reviews finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
ashland monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
amortization expense recognized on finite lived intangible assets was million for  million for and million for  and is primarily included in the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income 
goodwill in accordance with us gaap  ashland reviews goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment either annually or when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
this annual assessment is performed as of july and consists of ashland determining each reporting unit s current fair value compared to its current carrying value 
ashland has determined that its reporting units for allocation of goodwill include the specialty ingredients  water technologies  consumer markets and performance materials segments 
within the performance materials reportable segment  because further discrete financial information is provided and management regularly reviews this information  this reportable segment is further broken down into the composite polymers specialty polymers adhesives and elastomers reporting units 
goodwill associated with each of these reporting units as of september  was  million for specialty ingredients  million for water technologies  million for consumer markets  million for composites polymers specialty polymers adhesives and million for elastomers 
when externally quoted market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  ashland makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units through the use of a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples for guideline public companies in each reporting unit s industry peer group 
discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions 
significant assumptions ashland utilized in these models for the current year included projected business results and future industry direction  long term growth factors ranging from to and weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to 
ashland uses assumptions that it deems to be reasonable estimates of likely future events and compares the total fair values of each reporting unit to ashland s market capitalization  and implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
subsequent changes in these key assumptions could affect the results of future goodwill impairment reviews 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of goodwill  ashland s valuation techniques did not indicate any impairment 
each reporting unit s fair value was significantly over its carrying values  except for the water technologies reporting unit  whose calculated fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 
based on the sensitivity analysis performed on two key assumptions in the discounted cash flow model of the water technologies reporting unit  a negative change in the long term growth factor assumption would have resulted in a fair value still above the current carrying value  while a negative change in the weighted average cost of capital assumption would have resulted in a fair value slightly below the current carrying value 
in calculating the fair value of water technologies within the model  ashland assumed a long term growth factor of and a weighted average cost of capital of 
the weighted average cost of capital of is considered by ashland to be conservative based on ashland s significantly lower overall weighted average borrowing rate at september  of as well as the general overall lower interest rate environment that currently exists in the credit markets 
assuming no changes in the key assumptions identified and projected results  ashland currently anticipates the future fair value of the water technologies reporting unit to increase over time  however  future declines in the operating results of water technologies could indicate a need to reevaluate the fair value of this business under us gaap requirements and may ultimately result in an impairment to goodwill 
ashland continues to monitor for any potential indicators of impairment 
ashland compared and assessed the total fair values of the reporting units to ashland s market capitalization at the annual assessment date  including the implied control premium  to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
the calculated fair value for each reporting unit summed together exceeded ashland s market value as of the annual impairment testing date for by approximately  which ashland considers reasonable 
because the fair value results for each reporting unit did not indicate a potential impairment existed  ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during  and subsequent to this annual impairment test  no indications of an impairment were identified 
m other indefinite lived intangible assets other indefinite lived intangible assets include in process research and development ipr d and certain trademarks and trade names 
these assets had a carrying value of million as of september  ashland reviews these intangible assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
ashland tests these assets using a relief from royalty valuation method compared to the carrying value  except for ipr d assets  which are described within its section 
significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for these intangibles include  but are not limited to  such estimates as projected business results  growth rates  weighted average cost of capital  which ranged from to  and royalty rates ranging from to 
in conjunction with the july annual assessment of indefinite lived intangible assets  ashland s models did not indicate any impairment  as each indefinite lived intangible asset s fair value exceeded their carrying values 
ashland s assessment of an impairment charge on any of these assets classified currently as having indefinite lives  including goodwill  could change in future periods if any or all of the following events were to occur with respect to a particular reporting unit a significant change in projected business results  a divestiture decision  increase in ashland s weighted average cost of capital rates  decrease in growth rates or other assumptions  economic deterioration that is more severe or of a longer duration than anticipated  or another significant economic event

ipr d ashland has identified in process research and development ipr d projects within the acquired isp business that  as of the date of acquisition  had not been established in the marketplace 
these projects consist of various enhancements of existing products or new potential applications for products 
ashland used various valuation models based on discounted probability weighted future cash flows on a project by project basis in identifying projects as distinct assets 
during  ashland finalized its strategic assessment and evaluation of these projects 
initially  ashland recorded the value of these projects as million 
since ashland had not been given the opportunity to fully investigate each ipr d project before the acquisition was completed  the newly appointed management team completed its assessment of each ongoing ipr d project from isp during the fourth quarter of this resulted in an adjustment to the initially recorded value  reducing the fair value assigned to ipr d projects to million  with a corresponding increase to goodwill 
additionally as a part of this assessment  ashland identified several projects that were abandoned during due to ongoing research and development activities that occurred subsequent to the acquisition of isp 
ashland s abandonment of these projects based on post acquisition events resulted in a million impairment charge during  classified within the research and development expense caption of the statements of consolidated income 
the completion of this strategic assessment resulted in projects identified as distinct assets that totaled million 
identified ipr d acquired in a business combination is capitalized and tested for impairment annually and when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
as such  these assets have and will continue to be subjected to future impairment or amortization as the individual projects continue through the various stages of the feasibility assessment process 
the future feasibility of these assets will be evaluated on a quarterly basis by ashland or when a significant event has been deemed to have occurred

employee benefit obligations pension plans ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
in addition  ashland has non qualified unfunded pension plans which provide supplemental defined benefits to those employees whose benefits under the qualified pension plans are limited by the employee retirement income security act of and the internal revenue code 
ashland funds the costs of the non qualified plans as the benefits are paid 
pension obligations for applicable employees of non us consolidated subsidiaries are provided for in accordance with local practices and regulations of the respective countries 
for further information  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other postretirement benefit plans ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor health care and life insurance plans for eligible employees in the us and canada who retire or are disabled 
ashland s retiree life insurance plans are noncontributory  while ashland shares the costs of providing health care coverage with its retired employees through premiums  deductibles and coinsurance provisions 
ashland funds its share of the costs of the postretirement benefit plans as the benefits are paid 
for further information  see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements 
m change in accounting policy regarding pension and other postretirement benefits during  ashland elected to change its method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
previously  ashland recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity within the consolidated balance sheet on an annual basis and amortized the gains and losses into operating results over the average future service period of active employees within the related plans 
ashland elected to immediately recognize the change in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever a plan is determined to qualify for a remeasurement during a fiscal year 
the remaining components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense are recorded on a quarterly basis 
while ashland s historical policy of recognizing pension and other postretirement benefit expense is acceptable under us gaap  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable as it eliminates the delay in recognizing gains and losses within operating results 
this change also improves transparency within ashland s operating results by immediately recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions in the year these gains and losses are actually incurred 
this change in accounting policy was applied retrospectively during  adjusting all periods presented prior to change in expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans in connection with the change in accounting policy for pension and other postretirement benefits  ashland also elected during to change its method of accounting for certain costs included in inventory 
ashland elected to exclude the amount of its pension and other postretirement benefit costs applicable to inactive participants from inventoriable costs and charge them directly to cost of sales 
while ashland s historical policy of including all pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a component of inventoriable costs was acceptable  ashland believes that the new policy is preferable  as inventoriable costs only include costs that are directly attributable to current employees 
applying this change retrospectively during  in connection with the change in accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit costs  did not have a significant impact on previously reported inventory  cost of sales or segment reported results in any of the prior period financial statements 
in addition  as a further attempt to properly match actual operational expenses each business segment is incurring  ashland changed its expense allocation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans during previously  ashland allocated all components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expenses to each business segment on a ratable basis 
ashland now allocates only the service cost component of these plans to the actual business segment that incurred this expense 
all other pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense components are recorded within the unallocated and other reporting segment 
ashland believes the revised expense allocation more appropriately matches the cost incurred for active employees to the respective business segment 
actuarial assumptions ashland s pension and other postretirement obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions including the discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of compensation increase  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the mercer pension discount yield curve spot rates 
ashland uses this approach to reflect the specific cash flows of these plans for determining the discount rate 
the discount rates determined as of september  ranged from for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  and the rate of the compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be for  for and for the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be for  and for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to in and in m the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans will be for however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
ashland estimates total fiscal pension income for us and non us pension plans to be approximately million  which excludes the impact of actuarial gains or losses 
shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate us pension legislation and future funding requirements in july  the moving ahead for progress in the st century act map was enacted in the us and  in part  provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of specifically  map allows for the use of a year average interest rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years  as was previously required 
this relief will impact ashland s future required funding contributions to its us qualified pension plans 
reflecting the impact of this new law  ashland expects to contribute million to million to its us pension plans and million to its us pension plans during income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment in the forecasting of taxable income using historical and projected future operating results is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and deferred taxes 
under us gaap  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from ashland s estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation  geographic mix of earnings  completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans  the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment by ashland 
if actual results differ from the estimates made by ashland in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the respective deferred tax asset 
additionally  the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which includes such evidence as historical earnings  projected future earnings  tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences 
in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets ashland gives consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities other than those with an indefinite reversal period  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
ashland attaches the most weight to historical earnings due to their verifiable nature 
in evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide  we consider three years of cumulative income or loss 
in addition  ashland has reflected increases and decreases in our valuation allowance based on the overall weight of positive versus negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
as a result of the isp and hercules acquisitions during and  respectively  significant historical tax positions and structures related to isp and hercules are in the process of being combined within ashland 
some of these previous tax positions m and structures from isp and hercules required a complete reassessment regarding certain of ashland s pre acquisition tax positions and structures 
as such  material changes in certain tax matters may occur in the future based on deviations from ashland s current estimates and assumptions in combining these tax positions and structures

asbestos litigation ashland and hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland  have liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions  ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz associates  inc hr a 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims and litigation defense 
the claim experience of ashland and hercules are separately compared to the results of previously conducted third party epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ashland asbestos related litigation the claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos asserted against ashland result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
ashland asbestos related liability from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent update  completed during  it was determined that the liability for ashland asbestos claims should be increased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  ashland asbestos related receivables ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
for the ashland asbestos related obligations  ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best  as of september  the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  whose insurance policy obligations have been transferred to a subsidiary of berkshire hathaway 
ashland discounts this portion of the receivable based upon the projected timing of the receipt of cash from those insurers unless likely settlement amounts can be determined 
during fiscal  ashland entered into a new agreement with a number of london market insurance companies with respect to coverage for asbestos related insurance claims 
as a result  a million increase to the ashland asbestos receivable was recorded within the consolidated balance sheet  which had a million after tax effect on the statement of consolidated income within the discontinued operations caption 
during the year ended september   ashland received million in cash after reaching a settlement with certain insolvent london market insurance companies 
the cash received from this settlement during the current period was recognized as an after tax gain of million within discontinued operations of the statement of consolidated income since ashland s policy is to not record asbestos receivables for any carriers that are insolvent 
at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million excluding the hercules receivable for asbestos claims  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of m valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers  was updated 
this model update resulted in an additional million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
hercules asbestos related litigation hercules  a wholly owned subsidiary of ashland acquired during  has liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims typically arise from alleged exposure to asbestos fibers from resin encapsulated pipe and tank products which were sold by one of hercules former subsidiaries to a limited industrial market 
because claims are frequently filed and settled in large groups  the amount and timing of settlements and number of open claims can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
hercules asbestos related liability from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs  which generally approximates the mid point of the estimated range of exposure from model results 
ashland reviews this estimate and related assumptions quarterly and annually updates the results of a non inflated  non discounted approximate year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
during the most recent annual update of this estimate  completed during  it was determined that the liability for hercules asbestos related claims should be increased by million 
total reserves for asbestos claims were million at september  compared to million at september  during december  ashland essentially completed the final valuation assessment of the hercules asbestos claims liability existing as of the acquisition date and underlying claim files as part of transitioning to a standardized claims management approach 
this assessment resulted in a million and million reduction to the asbestos liability and receivable  respectively  which was accounted for as an adjustment to hercules opening balance sheet since the adjustment related to claims that had been incurred as of the acquisition date 
during the annual update  it was determined that the liability for asbestos claims should be reduced by million 
ashland reviewed the assumptions underlying the asbestos valuation model for both pre and post acquisition periods and noted declines in certain asbestos claim filing and expenditure trends  which is one of the key assumptions in the methodology used to project future asbestos liabilities 
ashland determined that a portion of the reductions in claim filing trends pertaining to pre acquisition claims should have been applied to the final acquisition date valuation assessment completed during the first quarter of  which resulted in million of the million adjustment being recorded to goodwill 
this million increase to goodwill was partially offset by a million reduction in probable insurance recoveries  resulting in a net million increase to goodwill 
as previously described  the methodology applied by hr a utilizes recent claim and settlement experience and the estimate and related assumptions are updated annually 
during and  there were favorable trends in some of the factors that impact the reserve estimate for the hercules asbestos claims 
as a result  and consistent with established practices  ashland made reductions to the projected future asbestos claim liability for hercules and a corresponding decline in the asbestos insurance receivable for estimated coverage amounts in both periods 
hercules asbestos related receivables for the hercules asbestos related obligations  certain coverage in place agreements with insurance carriers exist 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve are partially offset by probable insurance recoveries 
ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
as of september   this estimated receivable consists exclusively of domestic insurers  of which approximately have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best 
as of september  and  the receivables from insurers amounted to million and million  respectively 
during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve and its impact on valuation of future recoveries from insurers was updated 
this model update caused a million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
asbestos litigation cost projection projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes that the asbestos reserves for ashland and hercules m represent the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop these estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models was developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has currently estimated in various models ranging from approximately to year periods that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately million for the ashland asbestos related litigation and approximately million for the hercules asbestos related litigation or approximately billion in the aggregate  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
environmental remediation and asset retirement obligations ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september  compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the isp acquisition on august   ashland assumed certain environmental and asset retirement obligation contingencies 
the total obligations assumed by ashland in were million  which includes an increase of million for different remediation approaches than prior isp assumptions 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering  technical and feasibility studies are used  along with historical experience and other factors  to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland continues to discount certain environmental sites and regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and  ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately million 
no individual remediation location is material  as the largest reserve for any site is approximately or less of the remediation reserve 
outlook ashland achieved several noteworthy accomplishments during  which included significant earnings expansion as adjusted ebitda grew over compared to the prior year 
in addition  ashland reduced ongoing costs by million during the year through a broad corporate cost reduction program which included savings related to the integration of isp 
additionally  ashland improved its capital structure by refinancing certain long term debt instruments that have lowered future interest expense while reducing debt approximately million 
these accomplishments during have positioned ashland to continue its progress towards longer term financial performance objectives 
ashland has three primary objectives for first  ashland intends to focus on sales growth and cost management 
second  ashland expects to complete the remaining cost reduction programs  which are estimated to save an additional million by the end of the upcoming fiscal year 
finally  ashland is focused on continuing to generate free cash flow that will enable it to pay down debt and consider other value creating opportunities 
near term financial performance expectations for each region have not changed 
north and latin america continue to improve while asia and europe remain weak 
generally  each business should follow normal seasonal trends 
one exception is the specialty ingredients business  which will be challenged in the upcoming quarter by demand instability for certain guar products  which m represented approximately of sales within the energy business in since september   demand for these products has slowed in anticipation of the harvest expected in the last half of ashland s first quarter  which has led to significant price volatility in the current market and implied inventory values at or below current carrying costs 
depending on where the market eventually settles after upcoming crop yields are known  a range of possible outcomes from full realization of the carrying value of the inventory to a significant negative adjustment to the cost of inventory on hand could occur 
ashland is currently waiting for the market to stabilize before re entering 
the remainder of the specialty ingredients business is in position to perform well  including the other segments of the energy market 
in the three primary markets of focus  which include pharmaceutical  personal care and coatings  ashland expects solid growth in the upcoming year 
effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting in accordance with us gaap and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
as of september   ashland s monetary assets exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it currently more exposed to the effects of future inflation 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the united states in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflationary pressures seem moderate 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would substantially exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs during inflationary periods 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements including  without limitation  statements made under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation md a  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of ashland has identified some of these forward looking statements with words such as anticipates  believes  expects  estimates  is likely  predicts  may  will  should and intends and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology 
in addition  ashland may from time to time make forward looking statements in its annual report to shareholders  quarterly reports and other filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases and other written and oral communications

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately m to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on ashland s open foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would be a million impact on ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
ashland did not transact or have open any hedging contracts with respect to commodities or any related raw material requirements for the year ended september  during  ashland entered into interest rate swap agreements in order to manage the variable interest rate risk associated with term loans a and b that were borrowed in conjunction with the isp acquisition 
as of september   the total notional value of interest rate swaps related to term loans a and b equaled billion and million  respectively 
ashland records these hedges at fair value  with the effective portion of the gain or loss reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the fair value of ashland s interest rate swap assets and liabilities are calculated using standard pricing models 
these models utilize inputs derived from observable market data such as interest rate spot rates and forward rates  and are deemed to be level measurements within the fair value hierarchy 
counterparties to these interest rate swap agreements are highly rated financial institutions which ashland believes carry only a minimal risk of nonperformance
