item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a 
risk factors 
overview executive summary with an improving economy  our total revenue increased approximately from the level and we continued to keep our business right sized  allowing us to maintain a strong adjusted ebitda margin of during we have been cash flow positive for sixteen consecutive quarters and have used this positive cash flow to pay down debt of approximately million since june  our level of business started to improve on a year over year basis by the fourth quarter of and there were signs of economic recovery beginning in we continued to enact selective price increases  focusing on both new and existing customers that had units out on rent for an extended period of time  and  to date we have observed no measurable difference in the attrition rates for these customers 
we continue to optimize our hybrid sales model incorporating a local  as well as centralized component  with both groups incentivized on the basis of performance 
the sales personnel at the branches primarily focus on construction customers who tend to be large multi unit customers that benefit from local service  while those in our nsc in tempe  arizona are targeting the balance of our customers which includes single unit customers 
we also have a similar program in europe 
we monitor our business activity levels through a variety of metrics that we use to determine the optimal efficiencies for our drivers  dispatchers  managers  salespeople and corporate staff needed while continuing our focus on customer service and sales activity levels 
in  we converted a number our branches to operational yards by leveraging our branch management to cover more than one market  which allowed us to significantly lower our cost structure of these locations 
as our business began to stabilize from the economic downturn in  we began entering additional markets through three greenfield operational yards where we redeployed existing fleet to these new locations 
with growth returning to our business in  we accelerated the expansion of our business and opened an additional ten greenfield locations 
in addition to these ten greenfields  we entered two additional locations in by acquiring market leaders through traditional acquisitions just prior to year end 
we believe these continued efforts  together with managing working capital and controls over capital expenditures  will allow us to generate free cash flow in in  we have reduced our debt million and had million of unused borrowing capacity under our prior credit agreement as of december  our focus is on sales growth at both our existing and new locations as we continue our sophisticated sales campaign strategies at our nsc and branches 
we accomplish this in part through increasing sales personnel accountability through our disciplined sales processes  which we believe gives us a significant competitive advantage 
general we are the world s leading provider of portable storage solutions  through a total lease fleet of over  units at december  we operate in locations throughout north america and europe  maintaining a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements strong leadership position in virtually all markets served 
we offer a wide range of portable storage products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as our patented locking systems  premium doors  electrical wiring and shelving 
our portable storage units provide secure  accessible temporary storage for a diversified client base across various industries 
we derive most of our revenues from leasing our portable storage containers  security office units and mobile office units 
in addition to our leasing business  we also sell our portable storage containers and occasionally sell our security office units and mobile office units 
we also sell non core asset  when the opportunity arises 
our sales revenues represented of total revenues in on june   we acquired the outstanding shares of our largest competitor  msg  and msg became a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini 
we refer to this transaction as the merger or the msg acquisition throughout this annual report 
the msg acquisition was the largest acquisition we have completed and significantly expanded the number of our geographic locations in both the us and the us and also expanded our presence in a number of existing markets 
following the merger  we implemented our business model across the newly acquired msg branches 
this enabled us to close locations and combine branch management in overlapping markets as well as reposition our lease fleet to align with customer demand 
our consolidated statements of income for the periods reported include certain estimated expenses expected or incurred related to integration of msg acquisition and restructuring charges related to restructuring of our manufacturing operations as a result of the msg acquisition 
prior to acquiring msg  we grew both organically and through smaller acquisitions  which we used to gain a presence in new markets 
traditionally  we enter new markets through the acquisition of smaller local competitors and then implement our business model  which is typically more focused on customer service and marketing than the acquired business or other market competitors 
given our current utilization levels  we are primarily entering new markets by migrating idle fleet to new low cost greenfield operational yards and occasionally by acquiring an existing business when the right economic conditions are present 
these greenfield operational yards do not have all the overhead associated with a fully staffed branch as they typically only have a sales representative  drivers and yard personnel to handle deliveries and pick ups of our fleet 
a new location will generally have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as we penetrate the new market through our marketing efforts and increase the number of units on rent at the new location  we are typically able to reach company average levels of profitability after several years 
the costs associated with opening a greenfield operational yard are lower than a fully staffed branch which should have a comparatively positive effect on margins 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing new infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum levels of staffing and delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we are able to generate relatively high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level contributes significantly to profitability 
conversely  any additional fixed expenses require us to achieve additional revenue in order to maintain our margins 
when we refer to our operating leverage in this discussion  we are describing the impact on margins once we either cover our fixed costs or if we incur additional fixed costs in a market 
the level of non residential construction activity is an important external factor that we examine to determine the direction of our business 
because of the degree of our operating leverage  increases or decreases in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
beginning in the second quarter of  the level of our construction related business slowed down and then declined 
the decline continued and adversely affected our results of operations 
although the construction business has not returned to pre levels  the level of our construction related business stabilized and then began to increase in in  our construction activity improved quarter over quarter  compared to the same period in  and then slowed down in the fourth quarter while our retail activity in the fourth quarter 
table of contents 
index to financial statements increased with the seasonal business 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately and of our leased units at december  and  respectively 
in managing our business  we focus on growing leasing revenues  particularly in existing markets where we can take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
our goals are to maintain a stable operating margin and  after the economy returns to normalized conditions  a steady growth rate in leasing revenues 
we are a capital intensive business  so in addition to focusing on earnings per share eps  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  debt restructuring or extinguishment expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into and it provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to exclude the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 
in managing our business  we measure our adjusted ebitda margins from year to year based on the size of the branch 
we define this margin as adjusted ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new branch or operational yard  we must first fund and absorb the start up costs for setting up the new location  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new location will have lower adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the branch increases the number of units it has on rent 
because this operating leverage creates higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch will be expected to remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis if expenses remained the same or would decrease if fixed costs increased 
because ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures  as defined by the sec  we include in this annual report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
these reconciliations are included in item selected financial data 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage containers and combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are i cost of sales  ii leasing  selling and general expenses and iii depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units and mobile offices in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  remanufacture and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include  among other expenses  payroll and payroll related costs  advertising and other marketing expenses  real property lease expenses  commissions  repair and maintenance costs of our lease fleet and transportation equipment  stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our principal asset is our lease fleet  which has historically maintained value close to its original cost 
the steel units in our lease fleet other than van trailers are depreciated on the straight line method using an estimated useful life of years  after the date the unit is placed in service  with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data  which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
our wood mobile office units are depreciated over years to of original cost 
van trailers  which constitute a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over years to a residual value 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we also have other non core products that are added to our fleet as a result of acquisitions that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values

this increase is primarily due to variable costs associated with an increased level of business activity 
the major increases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were i delivery and freight costs increased million due to an increase in delivery activity of units and the relocation of fleet units to higher growth markets  including the deployment of units to our twelve new locations in  ii payroll and related payroll costs increased by million primarily due to additional yard personnel  drivers and sales commissions due to increased deliveries and the cost of fully staffing the nsc as well as strategic hires in sales and new market locations and iii repairs and maintenance expenses of our lease fleet and delivery equipment increased million as a result of an increase in delivery activity in both our core business and holiday rental business

twelve months ended december   compared to twelve months ended december  total revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in leasing  our primary revenue focus  accounted for approximately of total revenues during leasing revenues in decreased million  or  to million from million in this decrease in leasing revenues resulted from a decrease in the average number of units on lease  partially offset by a increase in yield 
yield was primarily driven by higher trucking and ancillary revenues  while the average rental rate per unit remained virtually unchanged 
in  the decline in both leasing and sales revenues was primarily the result of a reduction in business activity  including non residential construction activity  due to the weakness in the global economy 
our leasing revenue decline in improved sequentially over the same period in the prior year and was   and for the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively  as the year over year decline in our business leveled off by the time the year ended

leasing  selling and general expenses decreased million  or  to million in from million in leasing  selling and general expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  were and in and  respectively 
this slight increase as a percentage of revenues is due to our fixed costs in a declining revenue environment and was partially offset by variable cost saving reductions achieved by the cost cutting measures we implemented in response to the reduced revenue levels  primarily payroll related reductions and migrating a number of our branches to operational yards 
these operational yards do not have all the personnel and overhead expenses associated with a fully staffed branch 
the major decreases in leasing  selling and general expenses for were i payroll and related payroll costs  which decreased by million primarily due to reductions in our workforce and the decrease in commission expense resulting from the lower revenues levels  ii insurance expense  which decreased million due to improved safety programs and general reductions in premiums and iii advertising costs  which decreased million as we moved further away from printed advertising campaigns

liquidity and capital resources liquidity summary leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets which we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurring maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we deploy into our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our leasing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years  our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to our cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings 
for the past four years  we were cash flow positive after capital expenditures but excluding the merger 
during the past three years  our capital expenditures and acquisitions have been funded from our operating cash flow 
our operating cash flow is generally weakest during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units and as a result of seasonal weather in some of our markets 
during  and  we significantly reduced our capital expenditures and were able to fund capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we expect this trend to continue in in addition to cash flow generated by operations  our principal current source of liquidity is our credit agreement described below 
revolving credit facility 
on february   we entered into the new million credit agreement with deutsche bank ag new york branch and other lenders party thereto 
the new credit agreement refinanced our million prior credit agreement 
all amounts outstanding under the new credit agreement are due on february  the obligations of us and our subsidiary guarantors under both the credit agreement and the prior credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets 
at december   we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding and million of additional borrowing availability under the prior credit agreement  based upon borrowing base calculations as of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements such date 
we were in compliance with the terms of the prior credit agreement as of december  and were above the minimum borrowing availability threshold and therefore not subject to any financial maintenance covenants 
amounts borrowed  under both agreements  and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed 
outstanding amounts under the prior credit agreement bore interest at our option at either  i libor plus a defined margin  or ii the agent bank s prime rate plus a margin 
the applicable margins for each type of loan ranged from to for libor loans and to for base rate loans depending upon our debt ratio at each measurement date 
under the new credit agreement  the applicable margins for each type of loan will be for libor loans and for base rate loans for six months after february  and thereafter will be based on an availability based pricing grid and will range from to for libor loans and to for base rate loans at each measurement date 
availability of borrowings under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible container fleet including containers held for sale  work in process and raw materials and machinery and equipment  each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit 
the lease fleet is appraised at least once annually by a third party appraisal firm and up to of the net orderly liquidation value  as defined  is included in the borrowing base to determine how much we may borrow under this new facility 
the credit agreement provides for uk borrowings  which are  at our option  denominated in either pounds sterling or euros  by our uk subsidiary based upon a uk borrowing base  canadian borrowings  which are denominated in canadian dollars  by our canadian subsidiary based upon a canadian borrowing base  and us borrowings  which are denominated in us dollars  by mobile mini based upon a us borrowing base along with any canadian assets not included in the canadian subsidiary 
the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  i allow certain liens to attach to the company or its subsidiary assets  ii repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities  prepay certain indebtedness or make acquisitions or other investments subject to payment conditions  and iii incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions 
payment conditions as defined in the credit agreement allow restricted payments and acquisitions to occur without financial covenants as long as we have million of pro forma excess borrowing availability under the credit agreement 
we also must comply with specified financial maintenance covenants and affirmative covenants 
only if we fall below million of borrowing availability levels are the financial maintenance covenants applicable 
we believe our cash provided by operating activities will provide for our normal capital needs for the next months 
if not  we have sufficient borrowings available under our credit agreement to meet any additional funding requirements 
we monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an ongoing basis using publicly available information 
based upon that information  we do not presently think that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders might not be able to honor its commitments under the credit agreement 
senior notes 
at december   we had two series of outstanding senior notes i million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes and ii million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes and together with the notes  the mobile mini notes 
we issued the notes in november at an initial offering price of of their face value 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to redeem approximately million of the senior notes originally issued by msg due the msg notes and together with the mobile mini notes  the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements senior notes  to pay the redemption and tender offer premium approximately million and accrued interest approximately million on the msg notes  and to pay fees and expenses related to the offering 
we used the remaining net proceeds of approximately million to repay borrowings under the prior credit agreement 
the remaining million aggregate principal amount of outstanding msg notes at december  was fully redeemed in january and is no longer outstanding 
the senior notes include covenants  indemnities and events of default that are customary for indentures of this type  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt  sales of assets and payment of dividends 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior notes as of december  operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in over was primarily attributable to an increase in net income  after giving effect to non cash items  and to a lesser extent  reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in compared to the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in over was primarily attributable to a decrease in net income  after giving effect to non cash items and a decrease in working capital 
in  working capital was primarily affected by a decrease in accrued liabilities 
this decrease reflects the continued reduction in certain liabilities associated with the merger and the interest payment in connection with the million redemption of the msg notes 
in  there were decreases in receivables  inventories and deposits and prepaid expenses  which were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
these decreases were primarily due to the weakened economy  our restructured manufacturing operations and reduction of certain liabilities associated with the merger 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to cash provided of million and million in and  respectively 
in  we acquired businesses for cash payments of million 
we did not have any acquisitions in either or capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  provided net cash proceeds of million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
our capital expenditures for our lease fleet increased in as we acquired and remanufactured more units with the increased level of our leasing activity and prepared units for lease at the new locations 
capital expenditures for our lease fleet decreased in compared to as we required fewer units to be manufactured or remanufactured from prior acquisitions due to the then economic slowdown 
proceeds from sale of lease fleet units increased  compared to  and decreased in  compared to additions to the lease fleet primarily included remanufacturing of prior acquisition units and manufactured steel offices 
during the past several years  we have increased the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our products from our competitors products  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding wood mobile offices 
with the current economic conditions  we anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on remanufacturing units acquired in prior acquisitions to meet our lease fleet standards as these units are placed on rent  including supplying new locations with inventory to meet their demand 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from any sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were primarily for delivery equipment  technology and communication improvements and improvements to our branch locations 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
we have no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for enhancements to our computer information and communication systems 
our maintenance capital expenditures were approximately million in  million in and million in

in connection with the redemption of the msg notes we incurred approximately million in tender premiums 
in november  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes  which we used to redeem million in principal amount of msg notes 
in conjunction with the redemption of the msg notes  we incurred approximately million in tender and consent premiums

as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our prior credit agreement  and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under such agreement 
hedging activities 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments that we have used to manage our interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
we historically have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate so that the rate is payable based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
at december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under our prior credit agreement and million of senior notes  together with other primarily unsecured notes payable obligations  and obligations under capital leases 
we also have operating lease commitments for i real estate properties for the majority of our branches with remaining lease terms typically ranging from to years  ii delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price and iii office related equipment 
at december   primarily in connection with the issuance of our insurance policies  we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately million in letters of credit 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
we enter into operating and capital lease obligations from time to time

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season 
these retailers usually return these leased units to us in december and early in the following year 
this seasonality has historically caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in our operating cash flow during the first quarter of each year 

table of contents 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
lease and leasing ancillary revenues and related expenses generated under portable storage containers and mobile office units are recognized on a straight line basis 
delivery and hauling revenues and expenses from our portable storage containers and mobile office units are recognized when these services are earned 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and mobile office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell our products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with our customers 
share based compensation 
we account for the share based compensation using the modified prospective method and recognize the fair value of share based compensation transactions in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of our share based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we historically have not paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend rate 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in the past  we have issued stock options and restricted stock  which we also refer to as nonvested share awards 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
in  the share based compensation expense was reduced by million to reflect anticipated shortfalls related to nonvested share awards with vesting subject to performance conditions 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share awards at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves 
table of contents 
index to financial statements against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts receivables 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted eps as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
we operate in two reportable segments  which is comprised of three operating segments that also represent our reporting units north america  the uk and the netherlands 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these three reporting units 
at december   only north america and the uk have goodwill subject to impairment testing 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at december in addition  we perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we consider both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures  tax payments and discount rates 
each approach is given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
as of december   management assessed qualitative factors and determined it is more likely than not each of our two remaining reporting units assigned goodwill had estimated fair values greater than the respective reporting unit s individual net asset carrying values  therefore  the two step impairment test was not required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
there were no indicators of impairment at december  and depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over the estimated useful life of our units  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over seven years to an estimated residual value 
we have other non core products that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
van trailers and other non core products are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 
we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the competitors in our industry  profit margins we achieve on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from a residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual value and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted eps as reflected in the table below 
residual value useful life in years in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance are purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we 
table of contents 
index to financial statements must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies 
at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
our north america health benefits programs are considered to be self insured products  however  we buy excess insurance coverage that limits our medical liability exposure on a per individual insured basis 
additionally  our medical program has a limitation on our total aggregate claim exposure and we accrue and reserve to the total projected losses 
our canadian and european employees are primarily provided medical coverage through their governmental national insurance programs 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 
deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
at december   we have a million valuation allowance and million of gross deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of the deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management believes that certain state net operating loss carryforwards will expire unused and  as a result  has created a valuation allowance of million 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations  or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years 
table of contents 
index to financial statements beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered 
purchase accounting 
we account for acquisitions under the purchase method 
under the purchase method of accounting  the price paid by us  including the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock  if any  is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and the fair value of the convertible redeemable participating preferred stock issued at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired represents goodwill that is subject to annual impairment testing 
earnings per share 
basic net income per share is calculated by dividing income allocable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  net of shares subject to repurchase by us during the period 
income allocable to common stockholders is net income less the earnings allocable to preferred stockholders  if applicable 
diluted net income per share is calculated under the if converted method unless the conversion of the preferred stock is anti dilutive to basic net income per share 
to the extent the inclusion of preferred stock is anti dilutive  we calculate diluted net income per share under the two class method 
potential common shares include restricted common stock and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of nonvested share awards and upon conversion of convertible preferred stock using the treasury stock method 
recent accounting pronouncements multiple element arrangements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
this new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective for arrangements entered into after january  we adopted this accounting standard and it did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued clarification on the accounting guidance for business combinations 
this new accounting guidance clarifies the disclosure requirement for public entities that have entered into a new business combination during the current fiscal year 
such public entities must present comparative financial statements disclosing revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current fiscal year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this guidance is effective for business combinations entered into after january  we adopted this accounting standard and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
goodwill 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for goodwill impairment testing 
this new accounting guidance states that for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the reporting unit should perform step of a goodwill impairment test after considering the evidence of adverse qualitative factors that an impairment may exist 
this guidance is effective for us beginning january  we adopted this accounting standard and do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in september  the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
the amended guidance allows companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this accounting standard for the year ended december  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

index to financial statements comprehensive income 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  entities have the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities no longer have the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this amendment is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which for us is the first quarter in the adoption of this amendment will result in a change to our current presentation of comprehensive income  but will not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
under the amended guidance discussed in the preceding paragraph  an entity is required to present the effect of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to this provision and decided to defer the effective date  pending reconsideration  of the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
however  the requirement to present comprehensive income in one or two consecutive financial statement rather than to permit the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity remains 
fair value measurement 
in may  the fasb issued amendments to the existing guidance on fair value measurement 
the amendments are intended to create consistency between us generally accepted accounting standards and international financial reporting standards on measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including i the application of the highest and best use valuation premise concepts  ii measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s stockholders equity and iii quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level in addition  the amendments require additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us is calendar year these changes are required to be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of these amendments will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
we seek to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates through a financial arrangement intended to provide a hedge against a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
we continue to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments we have used to manage interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
at december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
we enter into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement meets the objectives described  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes

we currently have branch operations outside the us and we bill those customers primarily in their local currency  which is subject to foreign currency rate changes 
our operations in canada are billed in the canadian dollar  operations in the uk are billed in pound sterling and operations in the netherlands are billed in the euro 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant with our canadian operations  but we have more exposure to volatility with our european operations 
in order to help minimize our exchange rate gain and loss volatility  we finance our european entities through our revolving line of credit which allows us  at our option  to borrow funds locally in pound sterling denominated debt
