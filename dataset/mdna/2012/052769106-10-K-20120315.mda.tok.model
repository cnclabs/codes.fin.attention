we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry 
our backlog is primarily comprised of current software license product orders which have not yet shipped 
the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
backlog was million at january  compared to million at january  the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors not related to future trends or events such as the order fulfillment process  the method of software delivery or the linearity of our business within the fiscal period

risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks  a number of which are beyond our control 
in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business  financial condition and future results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted  causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  these risks and uncertainties may impact the forward looking statements described elsewhere in this form k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference 
they could affect our actual results of operations  causing them to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
current global economic uncertainty may impact our business  financial results and financial condition 
as our business has expanded globally  we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions 
the past several years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions  a tightening in the credit markets  high unemployment  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  increased government deficit spending and debt levels  uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt and extreme volatility in many financial instrument markets 
although some of these conditions appear to be abating there are a number of mixed indicators and it is not yet clear whether a sustainable recovery is occurring or a renewed slow down is taking place 
over the past several years  many of our customers have experienced tighter credit  negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces  thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us 
in addition  a number of our customers rely  directly and indirectly  on government spending 
current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues has caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases has forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations 
this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 
these actions may impact  and over the past several years have negatively impacted  our business  financial results and financial condition 
in addition  these factors may cause  and over the past several years have caused  us to restructure our business and in turn incur restructuring charges as well as take impairment charges on some of our long term assets 
in addition  the improvement of our financial performance over the past several fiscal quarters may be negatively impacted by lack of credit available to and the insolvency of key channel partners  impairing our distribution channels and cash flows  counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury functions  including timely access to our cash reserves and third party fulfillment of hedging transactions  counterparty failures negatively affecting our insured risks  inability of banks to honor our existing line of credit  which could increase our borrowing expenses or eliminate our ability to obtain short term financing  and decreased borrowing and spending by our end users on small and large projects in the industries we serve  thereby reducing demand for our products 
existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our net revenue and profits 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
furthermore  a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third party applications  or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes  including those related to cloud computing  mobile devices  and new computing platforms  may adversely affect the sale of our products 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would likely harm our business 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation and price 

table of contents our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines 
in addition to the other factors described in this part i  item a  some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include general market  economic  business and political conditions  including the impact of sales in particular geographies  including emerging economies  the ability of governments around the world to meet their financial and debt obligations  and finance infrastructure projects  lower growth or contraction of our upgrade or maintenance programs  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the success of our hedging activity  failure to expand our autocad and autocad lt products customer base to related design products  the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the success of new business or sales initiatives and increasing our portfolio of product suites suites  failure to maintain our revenue growth and profitability  the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels  weak or negative growth in the industries we serve  including architecture  engineering and construction  manufacturing and digital media and entertainment markets  failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses or to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions  and successfully integrate such acquired businesses and technologies  perceived or actual technical or other problems with a product or combination of products  unexpected or negative outcomes of matters and expenses relating to litigation or regulatory inquiries  failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications  restructuring or other accounting charges and unexpected costs or other operating expenses  pricing pressure or changes in product pricing or product mix  platform changes  timing of product releases and retirements  failure to continue momentum of frequent release cycles or to move a significant number of customers from prior product versions in connection with our programs to retire major products  failure to achieve and maintain planned cost reductions and productivity increases  changes in tax laws or regulations  tax arrangements with foreign governments or accounting rules  such as increased use of fair value measures and the potential requirement that us registrants prepare financial statements in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs  changes in sales compensation practices  dependence on and the timing of large transactions  failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs  especially in developing countries  our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes  including those related to cloud computing  mobile devices  and new computing platforms  failure to achieve sufficient sell through in our channels for new or existing products  renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements  interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers  the timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities  failure to achieve continued success in technology advancements  and natural disasters such as the earthquakes and tsunami in japan in march we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions 
in particular  our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually 
table of contents affected by a slower summer period  and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability 
greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 
further  gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of creative finishing products and consulting services  which historically have had lower margins  grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher margin products and services 
if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel  or achieve anticipated levels of sell through  our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 
if our distribution channel suffers financial losses  becomes financially unstable or insolvent  is negatively impacted by the recent consolidation between two important distributors  or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products  our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 
we sell our software products both directly to end users and through a network of distributors and resellers 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers  and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network 
computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized  have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years 
we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them 
in the past we have taken steps to support them  and may take additional steps in the future  such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts 
these steps  if taken  could harm our financial results 
if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent  they would not be able to maintain their business and sales  or provide customer support services  which would negatively impact our business and revenue 
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates tech data 
tech data accounted for  and of our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
on october   tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software mum in europe 
mum has been a european distributor of our products in that region 
the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data and on a consolidated basis would have accounted for of our revenue for the fiscal year ended january   respectively if the acquisition had occurred on february  although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data  including following the acquisition of certain assets of mum  if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate  it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be  at least temporarily  negatively impacted 
this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 
over time  we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers  such as their incentive programs  pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives 
changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business 
in addition  the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sell through with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business 
in particular  if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us  we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers 
these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue  decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell negatively impacts our future revenue and financial results 
our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period  which is typically one year 
our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including overall global economy  the health of their businesses  and the perceived value of the maintenance program 
if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products  our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 
in addition  a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number 
table of contents of licenses that we sell 
any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell  even if our customers attach rates do not change  will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue 
this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts  which is predominantly one year  but may also range up to five years 
decreases in net maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue  however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount  timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 
we are dependent on international revenue and operations  exposing us to significant regulatory  global economic  intellectual property  collections  currency exchange rate  taxation  political instability and other risks  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue 
our international revenue  including that from emerging economies  is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets  including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time 
these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our international revenue  and consequently our business as a whole 
further  our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends  which can negatively impact our financial results  even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 
we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue  and  as we expand our international development  sales and marketing expertise  will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates  including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and practices  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  transportation delays  operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices  particularly in emerging economies  increasing enforcement by the us under the foreign corrupt practices act  adoption of stricter anti corruption laws in certain countries  including the united kingdom  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  potential changes in tax laws  including possible us tax law changes that  if enacted  could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings  tax arrangements with foreign governments  including our ability to meet and review the terms of those tax arrangements  and laws regarding the management of and access to data and public networks  possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses  increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities  inadequate local infrastructure  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  and other factors beyond our control  including popular uprisings  terrorism  war  natural disasters and diseases 
some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 
even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations  our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 
our business could suffer as a result of risks  costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 
we regularly acquire or invest in businesses  software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions  strategic alliances or equity or debt investments 
the risks associated with such acquisitions include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating products  operations and personnel  inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims  the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections  the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the diversion of management s time and attention 
our recent increase in the number of acquisitions further exacerbates these risks 
in addition  such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as the inability to retain customers  vendors  distributors  business partners  and other entities associated with the acquired business  the potential impact on relationships with existing customers  vendors  distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business  the potential that due diligence of the acquired business or product does not identify significant problems  the potential any one or multiple of the investments become impaired in a given reporting period  the potential for incompatible business cultures  and 
table of contents significant transaction or integration related costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks  and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business 
in addition  such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transaction related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments 
these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period  cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 
the current global economic uncertainty may impact our business forcing us to take actions that could be costly and may not be as effective as we anticipate  and may force us to take additional actions to reduce our expenses and stimulate demand for our products 
the current global economic uncertainty may lead to a reduction of our revenue levels and force us to take actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our reduced revenue levels 
over the past several years we have on several occasions taken such actions 
in taking any future restructuring actions  we may incur  and over the past several years have incurred  additional costs that negatively impact our operating margins 
if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives  we may eliminate critical elements of our operations  the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from eventual economic growth 
in addition  such global economic uncertainty and resulting impact on our business may cause us to take  and over the past several years we have taken  actions to stimulate demand for our products through a number of programs 
although we attempt to balance the cost of these programs against the longer term benefits  it is possible that we will make such investments without corresponding increases in demand for our products and our revenue 
this would further reduce our operating margins and have a negative impact on our financial results 
net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the other factors described in this part i  item a and the following changes in estimates of future results or recommendations by securities analysts  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  shortfalls in our expected financial results  including net revenue  earnings or key performance metrics  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  unusual events such as significant acquisitions  divestitures  regulatory actions and litigation  changes in laws  rules or regulations applicable to our business  general socio economic  political or market conditions  and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance  such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors 
significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and time consuming litigation 
historically  after periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation 
this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources 
our strategy to develop and introduce new product and service offerings  including new product features  exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance  costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 
rapid technological changes  as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences  characterize the software industry 
we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies  such as our design and entertainment products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products 
in addition  we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as an increase in our portfolio of  and focus on  suites 
we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products  as well as through acquisitions of new product lines 
such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs  or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers  adversely affecting our competitive position 

table of contents in particular  a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our suites 
over time  we aim to migrate customers using standalone autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our suites offerings 
should sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or standalone autodesk flagship products decrease without a corresponding increase in suites product revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our suites  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
additionally  the software products we offer are complex  and despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
further  given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry  the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing  mobile devices  new computing platforms and other technologies  our executive management team must act quickly  continuously and with vision 
although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges  if we fail to execute properly on that strategy  adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve  fail to internalize and execute on that strategy  we may fail to meet our customers expectations  fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees 
this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives  if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology  we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations  and expanding our portfolio of suites and our offering of software as a service  and realign our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency 
we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful 
market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price 
often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis 
if any of our assumptions about expenses  revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect  or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful  our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  and our financial results will be negatively impacted 
because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products  including our autocad based software products including suites  if these products are not successful  our net revenue will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products  including autocad software  products based on autocad  which includes our suites that serve specific markets  upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad 
any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycle  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition  economic and market conditions and the availability of third party applications  would likely harm our financial results 
during the fiscal year ended january   combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products  not including suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component  represented of our total net revenue 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protections  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software products is time consuming and costly 
while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem 
furthermore  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
additionally  we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets  including our source code 
if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs  we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code 
the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality  which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation 
we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of non disclosure agreements with our customers  contractors  vendors and partners 
however  it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization 
if this were to occur  it may be difficult and or costly for us to enforce our rights  and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

table of contents we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 
because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change  and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 
we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our earnings exposure and cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as part of our risk management strategy  we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets  liabilities and other obligations  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for to months in the future  and provide us with some protection against currency exposures 
however  our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful  resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 
the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period 
although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility  we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk  and in any case  will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs 
such volatility  even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses  impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as more software patents are granted worldwide  the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap  we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been  and may in the future be  asserted against us  and any such assertions could harm our business 
additionally  certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents 
any such claims or threats  whether with or without merit  have been and could in the future be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and diversion of resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  which would likely harm our business 
our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends  market volatility and other economic factors 
if general economic conditions further cause interest rates to decline  credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate  or illiquidity in the financial marketplace  we may continue to experience a decline in interest income  an inability to sell our investments  or impairment in the value of our investments 
it is our policy to invest our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with  and in the custody of  financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution  type of security and issuer 
however  we are subject to general economic conditions  interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments  the net realizable value of our investments including our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them 
in the us  for example  the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions 
any one of these factors could reduce our interest income  or result in material charges  which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 
if we were to experience a loss on any of our investments that loss may cause us to record an other than temporary impairment charge 
the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 
in any of these scenarios  our liquidity may be negatively impacted  which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business  taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 
we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries  and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future  all of which are costly  distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome  or a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or the trading price for our securities 
we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies 
as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved  we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries 
like many other high technology companies  the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices  and the business practices of others in our industry  have increased in recent years 
in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency  we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes 
while outcomes of such actions vary  any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us  whether successful or not  could result in 
table of contents expensive costs of defense  costly damage awards  injunctive relief  increased costs of business  fines or orders to change certain business practices  significant dedication of management time  diversion of significant operational resources  or otherwise harm our business 
in any of these cases  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products  harm our reputation  create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 
we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our product source code and computer systems 
there appears to be an increasing number of computer hackers developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses  worms  and the like that could attack our products and computer systems 
despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs  it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk 
like all software products  our software is vulnerable to such attacks 
the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products  cause errors in the output of our customers work  allow unauthorized access to sensitive  proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes 
if this were to occur  our reputation may suffer  customers may stop buying our products  we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section  we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
the report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
while we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january   as indicated in our management report on internal control over financial reporting  included in this annual report on form k  we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting 
if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements  which  if not accurate  may significantly impact our financial results 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates for a number of items  including the fair value of financial instruments  goodwill  long lived assets and other intangible assets  the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards 
we also make assumptions  judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions  bonuses  and sabbaticals  and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions  partner incentive programs  product returns reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies 
these assumptions  judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from our estimates  and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 
changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices  or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices  new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules  or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 
further  such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 
for example  the us based financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles gaap under sec regulations and those who are required to follow ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the 
table of contents fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including  but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 
in addition  the sec has not yet made a determination regarding how or if ifrs will be incorporated into the financial reporting system for us companies 
a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results 
it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective  whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  as we evolve and change our business and sales models  we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models  particularly in the area of revenue recognition 
our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 
we are a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings  statutory rates  intercompany transfer pricing  and enacted tax rules 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 
our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  professional  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
historically  competition for these key personnel has been intense 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineering and sales personnel  could make it difficult to meet key objectives  such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would likely harm our business 
disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 
we license certain key technologies from third parties 
licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
in particular markets  such disruptions have in the past  and would likely in the future  negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
additionally  technology created by outsourced product development  whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions  have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products  adequate transfer of technology know how and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 
as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development  our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 
we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities 
we 
table of contents believe our partnering strategy allows us to  among other things  achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings 
our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers 
independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world  may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future 
in addition  use of development resources through consulting relationships  particularly in non us jurisdictions with developing legal systems  may be adversely impacted by  and expose us to risks relating to  evolving employment  export and intellectual property laws 
these risks could  among other things  expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 
we rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational services  including hosting and delivery  certain of our customer services operations as well as some of our operations  any interruption or delay in service from these third parties  breaches of security or privacy  or failures in data collection could expose us to liability  harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 
we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use 
as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in third party facilities  a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability of customer data 
in addition  our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach  and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information  including source code 
unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through break ins  breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party  employee theft or misuse  or other misconduct 
we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products 
although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers  we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers  or upon suppliers in a single country  for these services or materials 
the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy 
if any of these situations were to occur  our reputation could be harmed  we could be subject to third party liability  including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 
we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems 
should our investments not succeed  or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations  our business could be harmed 
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure  internal technology systems and our websites for our development  marketing  operational  support  sales  accounting and financial reporting activities 
we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers 
such improvements are often complex  costly and time consuming 
in addition  such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems  or uncover problems with our existing technology systems 
unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations  loss of revenue  errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation 
our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 
our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure  our internal technology systems and our websites 
we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use 
the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event  such as an earthquake  fire  flood  tsunami  weather event  telecommunications failure  power failure  cyber attack or war  could adversely impact our business  financial results and financial condition 
we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event  however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations 
in addition  any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products 
this could in turn decrease that country s or region s demand for our products  thereby negatively impacting our financial results

stockholders as of january   the number of common stockholders of record was because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders  we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders 
issuer purchases of equity securities the purpose of autodesk s stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders  and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions  the volume of employee stock option exercises  stock issuances  the trading price of our common stock  cash on hand and available in the us  and company defined trading windows

strategy autodesk s vision is to help people imagine  design and create a better world 
we do this by developing software for the world s designers  architects  engineers  and digital artists the people who create the world s products  buildings  infrastructure  films  and games 
autodesk serves customers in three primary markets architecture  engineering and construction  manufacturing  and digital media and entertainment 
our goal is to provide our customers with the world s most valuable  innovative  and engaging software and services 
our product and services portfolio allow our customers to digitally visualize  simulate  and analyze their projects  helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions  save time  money  and resources  and become more innovative 
today  complex challenges such as globalization  urbanization  and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness  and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities 
to achieve these goals  we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets  and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 
by innovating in existing technology categories  we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets 
our products are designed to be easy to learn and use  and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment  a low total cost of ownership  and a rapid return on investment 
in addition  our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products 
the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage  because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries 
this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above 
we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for long term growth and industry leadership 
in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology  our large global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions  faculty and students is a key competitive advantage 
this network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world 
our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase  deploy  learn  and support our products quickly and easily 
we have a significant number of registered third party developers who create products that work well with autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 
users with expertise in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce 
we offer extensive educational programs  including student versions of software  curricula  and faculty development 
we have an extensive global community of students who are experienced with our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users thus reducing the cost 
table of contents of training and providing fresh talent for our customers 
our global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions and students has been developed over our twenty nine year history 
we believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate 
we continually strive to increase the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways 
first  we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization  analysis and simulation 
second  we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability  thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness 
third  we continue to develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers  such as product suites  cloud based services  and delivery of our solutions on mobile devices and new hardware platforms 
fourth  we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the customers of our customers  thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce 
finally  we continue to develop new lines of consumer products and services that are delivered and experienced through the web  tablets  and mobile devices providing our advanced visualization technologies to consumers a whole new category of autodesk customer 
autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers 
we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer 
just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago  we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud  mobile and social computing 
our growth strategy is predicated upon leading the transition in the industries we serve into the cloud in three ways grow 
we believe sufficient opportunity remains in our pc based software business and intend to continue to grow this business 
in particular we are offering product suites with improved interoperability and usability to enhance our customers productivity 
we are continuing to drive maintenance and new licensing models to better match the business needs of our customers 
we will continue emphasis on developing direct relationships with large  global customers and growing in emerging economies 
transform 
at the same time we grow our desktop software business  we are migrating many of our products to the cloud 
this entails development of new cloud computing infrastructure and restructuring our applications to leverage the cloud 
we are also developing new capabilities that are enabled by the cloud such as collaborative plm and on line simulation 
our goal is to lead our industry in transitioning to the cloud 
expand 
we believe that the combination of cloud  mobile  and social computing affords us the opportunity to expand our business into new markets 
our consumer business is an example of this where we have added new customers 
we intend to continue to develop businesses such as this to both add new customers and find new capabilities to incorporate in our core business 
we believe that expanding our customers portfolios to include our suites presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy 
as our customers in all industries adopt our design suites  we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data 
for fiscal  revenue from suites increased  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  suites increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy 
while emerging economies are important for all global businesses  we believe they hold special opportunity for autodesk 
much of the growth in the world s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies 
further  emerging economies face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address  for example infrastructure build out 
we believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us and revenue from emerging countries increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging countries represented and of fiscal and fiscal net revenue  respectively 
while we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies  conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges  including economic volatility  geopolitical risk  local competition  intellectual property protection  poorly developed business infrastructure  scarcity of talent and software piracy 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail cost and integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions 
we currently anticipate that we will acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 
in fiscal  we increased the number  pace and dollars spent on acquisitions in comparison to fiscal  but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs  the availability of suitable sellers and technology  and our own financial condition 

table of contents our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions  including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets  leverage our large global network of distributors  resellers  third party developers  customers  educational institutions  and students  improve the performance and functionality of our products  and adequately protect our intellectual property 
if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations  we may not be able to implement our strategy  which could potentially adversely affect our business 
for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item a  risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly reevaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that of all our significant accounting policies  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority 
if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license  we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered 
if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services  the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not believe that collection is probable  the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 
our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure  where distributors sell to resellers  and a one tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers 
our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor  in a two tiered structure  or reseller  in a one tiered structure  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns  among other criteria 
we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments  regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
marketable securities 
at january  we had million of short and long term marketable securities 
marketable securities are stated at fair value 
as described in note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter 
fair value is defined as an exit price  representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets  the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low 
this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities  which we consider to be level assets and level assets 
however  determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level requires significant judgment 
for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities because an active market does not exist for these securities which have been issued by private corporations 
these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment 
whenever possible  we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available  when determining fair value 

table of contents business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities  as well as to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales  maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired  or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
as of january   a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill  nor result in impairment of goodwill 
for further discussion see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
realizability of long lived assets 
we assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets  other than goodwill  annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models  which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows  we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long lived assets 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  primarily a result of tax credits  net operating losses  and timing differences for reserves  accrued liabilities  stock options  purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles  partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries  deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against california and canadian deferred tax assets 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors  including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments 
any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award  and recognize expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we estimate 
table of contents the fair value of stock based payment awards including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of a stock based award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends 
the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted  as needed 
share based compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our commons stock on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
legal contingencies 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates

overview of fiscal fiscal year ended as a of net revenue fiscal year ended as a of net revenue january  january  in millions net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations our business grew year over year as evidenced by our increases in revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue increased  gross profit increased and income from operations increased 
contributing to the year over year increases in revenue were increases in revenue from new seat licenses  maintenance revenue  revenue for most of our major products  all of our reportable segments  and all of our geographies during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the reasons for these increases are discussed below under the heading results from operations 
in addition  we continued to make progress in controlling our operating costs  which led to year over year improvements in profitability 
the increase in income from operations in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to the increase in our net revenue  while controlling the growth of operating expenses 
our total operating margin increased as a percentage from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in our operating margin was primarily due to net revenue increasing at a faster rate than the increase in our costs due to our cost containment efforts during fiscal net revenue increased million or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  while our operating expenses increased million  or for fiscal the increase in operating expenses in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to an increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and the return of employee costs which were temporarily suppressed in the prior year through salary reductions  employee incentives reductions and mandatory vacation  and other costs associated with higher revenue 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges of million 
we believe net revenue for fiscal will increase by approximately compared to fiscal we anticipate fiscal operating margin will increase by approximately basis points compared to fiscal we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us  japan  germany  the united kingdom and france 
included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency 
our revenue benefited from foreign exchange 
table of contents rate changes during fiscal  as compared to fiscal had applicable exchange rates from fiscal been in effect during fiscal and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal  on a constant currency basis  net revenue would have increased compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  total spend  defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses  increased compared to the prior fiscal year as reported and increased on a constant currency basis 
changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue  total spend and income from operations in future periods 
we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions  but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 
we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively  tech data 
tech data accounted for and of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year and  respectively 
on october   tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software mum  which has been a distributor of our products in europe 
the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data  which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for and of our net revenue for fiscal years and  respectively  if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data 
our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services 
should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason  we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 
our primary goals for fiscal are to grow revenue and improve our operating margin percentage by delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers and investing in product functionality and new product lines  including suites offerings 
however  there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results 
additionally  we believe that unemployment rates and the availability of credit to major industries we serve are important indicators for our business  if global economic conditions deteriorate we may not achieve our financial goals 
revenue from flagship products was of total net revenue during fiscal  respectively  and increased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal revenue from suites was of total net revenue for fiscal  and increased as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we released our new design and creation suites that include english language versions of our autodesk design suite  autodesk factory design suite  autodesk product design suite  autodesk building design suite  autodesk entertainment creation suite  autodesk infrastructure design suite and autodesk plant design suite  as well as a japanese language version of our autodesk entertainment creation suite 
suites revenue and growth rates for suites consist primarily of revenue from our pre existing suite families  such as inventor and revit suites 
revenue from new and adjacent products was of total net revenue during the fiscal  and increased as compared to fiscal we anticipate  as our new and existing customers migrate from our stand alone products  that our revenue from suites will increase as a percentage of revenue and that our revenue from our flagship and new and adjacent products will decline as a percentage of revenue 
at january   we had  million in cash and marketable securities 
we completed fiscal with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal our deferred revenue balance at january  included million of customer maintenance contracts  which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts 
our maintenance contracts are for a term of one year  but may be two or three year  or occasionally as long as five year terms 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal comparatively  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during fiscal

product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses and upgrades 
other revenue consists of revenue from creative finishing  consulting and training services and hosted technology solutions 
total license and other revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue from commercial new seat licenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  percentage points of the increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold  and percentage points was due to an increase in the average net revenue per seat 
commercial new seat revenue  as a percentage of license and other revenue  was for both fiscal and also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the increase in upgrade revenue 
upgrade revenue increased during fiscal in comparison to fiscal primarily due to an acad lt upgrade promotion during the first quarter of fiscal  an increase in large enterprise transactions  customers migrating from stand alone products to suites and a promotion that was run related to the education solutions suites 
backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter decreased by million during fiscal from million at january  to million at january  backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
revenue from the sales of our services  training and support  included in license and other revenue  represented less than of net revenue for all periods presented 

table of contents maintenance revenue our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program 
our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts 
under our maintenance program  customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available  downloadable training courses and online support 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 
maintenance revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in commercial maintenance revenue 
the increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to an percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term and a percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat 
commercial maintenance revenue represented of maintenance revenue for both fiscal and total subscription program enrollment at january  and consisted of about million users and million users  respectively 
changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms 
our maintenance contracts are for a term of predominantly one year  but may be two or three year  or occasionally as long as five year  terms 
net maintenance billings increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was due to an increase in maintenance renewals  new multi year maintenance contracts  and the impact from the upgrade promotions mentioned above in license and other revenue

this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented of net revenue for fiscal and for fiscal international net revenue represented and of our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue 
unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected  and could continue to significantly affect  our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue 
additionally  the us credit rating downgrade and weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt  high unemployment  and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results

direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pc based workstations for creative finishing in the m e segment  costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 
cost of license and other revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal primarily due to increased support costs and lower margin consulting engagements

cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers  including stock based compensation expense for these employees  rent and occupancy  shipping and handling costs and professional services fees 
cost of maintenance revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in maintenance support headcount and increased annual fulfillment costs related to supplying usb flash drives of our suites products 
cost of maintenance revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in maintenance support headcount 
these increases were partially offset by savings on freight and materials costs as fewer maintenance customers require physical shipments than in the past due to electronic fulfillment 
cost of revenue  at least over the near term  is affected by the volume and mix of product sales  mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment  fluctuations in consulting costs  amortization of purchased technology  new customer support offerings  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products  and employee stock based compensation expense 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars  but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal marketing and sales fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions marketing and sales as a percentage of net revenue marketing and sales expenses include salaries  bonuses  benefits  and stock based compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees  and the expense of travel  entertainment and training for such personnel  and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  and various sales and promotional programs 
marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing  sales and dealer commissions  rent and occupancy  and the cost of supplies and equipment 
marketing and sales expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher employee related costs related to salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal marketing and sales expenses increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher employee related costs related to variable compensation  including commissions  bonuses and related fringe benefits 
variable compensation expenses increased as a result of exceeding our fiscal target revenue growth and operating margins growth targets more than we did in fiscal our annual incentive plans are based on forecasted revenue and operating margin  with current year targets set at the beginning of the fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by the decrease in advertising and promotion spending and stock based compensation expense 
we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses 
as a result  we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal  as compared to fiscal research and development fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions research and development as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist primarily of salaries  bonuses  benefits and

no leased facilities were consolidated as part of the fiscal restructuring plan 
the fiscal and restructuring plans resulted in the consolidation of approximately and leased facilities  respectively 
in connection with these restructuring programs  we recorded a favorable adjustment for changes in previous estimates of million in fiscal and we recorded restructuring related charges of million and million during fiscal and

impairment of goodwill and intangibles fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions impairment of goodwill as a percentage of net revenue we did not record an impairment charge during fiscal or during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million representing the entire goodwill balance of our m e segment as of april  this goodwill balance related to our m e segment s fourth quarter fiscal acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage 
should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future  additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill 
as of january   a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill  nor result in impairment of goodwill

the loss on foreign currency in fiscal and is primarily due to the impact of re measuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity 
the amount of gain loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the period 
interest and investment income  net  fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances  average maturities and interest rates 
the decrease in interest and investment income  net  during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our trading securities that are marked to market each period 
interest and other income  net  decreased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to foreign currency losses 
provision for income taxes we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 
our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by tax benefits associated with closure of audits in fiscal 
table of contents our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate decreased percentage points from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates  the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal and a decrease in non deductible stock based compensation expense  offset by a decrease in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal compared to fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law 
as a result of the newly enacted legislation  we expect that in fiscal years and beyond  income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly  deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 
our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits  state income taxes  the tax impact of stock based compensation  accounting for uncertain tax positions  business combinations  us manufacturer s deduction  closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits  changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that  if enacted  could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings 
a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries 
our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided 
at january   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets

other financial information in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap discussed above  we believe the following non gaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance 
for the fiscal years ended january   and  our gross profit  gross margin  income from operations  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and non gaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin  operating margin and per share data january  january  january  unaudited gross profit non gaap gross profit gross margin non gaap gross margin income from operations non gaap income from operations operating margin non gaap operating margin net income non gaap net income diluted earnings per share non gaap diluted earnings per share for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process  we use non gaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis 
these non gaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
we use non gaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential 
in addition  these non gaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance 
we also use these measures for purposes of determining company wide incentive compensation 
there are limitations in using non gaap financial measures because non gaap financial measures are not prepared in 
table of contents accordance with gaap and may be different from non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
the non gaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measures 
we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a non gaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures 
the presentation of non gaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the non gaap financial measures are meant to supplement  and be viewed in conjunction with  gaap financial measures 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 

table of contents reconciliation of gaap financial measures to non gaap financial measures in millions except for gross margin  operating margin and per share data fiscal year ended january  unaudited gross profit stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles non gaap gross profit gross margin stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles non gaap gross margin income from operations stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles impairment of goodwill restructuring charges non gaap income from operations operating margin stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles impairment of goodwill restructuring charges non gaap operating margin net income stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles impairment of goodwill restructuring charges establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets discrete tax provision items income tax effect of non gaap adjustments non gaap net income diluted net income per share stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles impairment of goodwill restructuring charges establishment of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets discrete tax provision items income tax effect of non gaap adjustments non gaap diluted net income per share amortization of purchased intangibles includes amortization of purchased developed technology  customer relationships  and trade names for acquisitions subsequent to december 
table of contents our non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following stock based compensation expenses 
we exclude stock based compensation expenses from non gaap measures primarily because they are non cash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
we incur amortization of acquisition related purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies 
the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
goodwill impairment 
this is a non cash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired 
as explained above  management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
restructuring charges 
these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions 
in connection with these restructuring actions  we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated  and the closure of facilities and cancelation of certain contracts 
we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period 
establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets 
this is a non cash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets 
as explained above  management finds it useful to exclude certain non cash charges to assess the appropriate level of various expenses to assist in budgeting  planning and forecasting future periods 
discrete tax items 
we exclude the gaap tax provision  including discrete items  from the non gaap measure of income  and include a non gaap tax provision based upon the projected annual non gaap effective tax rate 
discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year  unusual or infrequently occurring items  or the tax impact of certain stock based compensation 
examples of discrete tax items include  but are not limited to  certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years  certain costs related to business combinations  certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law 
management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations 
income tax effects on the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses 
the income tax effects that are excluded from the non gaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and non gaap costs and expenses  primarily due to stock based compensation  purchased intangibles and restructuring for gaap and non gaap measures 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products 
our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs 
in addition to operating expenses  we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives  which include acquisitions of products  technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program 
see further discussion of these items below 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  million and net accounts receivable of million 
in addition  we have a line of credit facility that permitted unsecured short term borrowings of up to million that we entered into in may  which replaced our previous million line of credit facility that would have expired in august during fiscal  we had no borrowings or repayments under our current or prior line of credit facility 
this credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and expires in may our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally 
our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates citibank 
in addition  citibank is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our million line of credit 
the increase in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to  million at january  from  million at january  is principally the result of cash generated from operations and to a lesser extent  the proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
these increases to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock  acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases  capital expenditures  and other investing

cash generated from operations was positively impacted by higher net revenue 
the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was net income of million increased by the effect of non cash expenses totaling million associated with depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
in addition  net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was million 
the primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings and an increase in accounts payable for fiscal compared to fiscal the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings and the reduction of accrued expenses primarily related to accrued commissions in fiscal compared to fiscal our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was at january  compared to at january  the increase in days sales outstanding is due to higher billings in the last month of fiscal compared to the last month of fiscal at january   our short term investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of million and a cost basis of million

s treasury securities  million invested in municipal securities and million invested in other short term securities 
at january   million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  stock repurchases  and capital expenditures  including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail cost and integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making decisions regarding acquisitions 
we currently anticipate that we will acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 
in fiscal  we increased the number  pace and dollars spent on acquisitions in comparison to fiscal  but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs  the availability of suitable sellers and technology  and our own financial condition 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated and held in us dollar and are concentrated in a few locations around the world  with substantial amounts held outside of the us we believe that such dispersion meets our business and liquidity needs 
certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions  but under current us tax law  could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits 
we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings  except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances  our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
our existing credit facility at march  is million of which we have no amounts outstanding 
this credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
our revenue  earnings  cash flows  receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations 
we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions 
in addition  we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
as of january  and  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months 
contracts were primarily denominated in euros  japanese yen  swiss francs  british pounds  
table of contents canadian dollars  and australian dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total fiscal fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations deferred compensation obligations pension obligations other obligations total other obligations include future sabbatical obligations and asset retirement obligations 
this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities  certain purchase obligations as discussed below  long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions  since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note  income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities  net of sublease income  computer equipment and other equipment leases 
purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements  it infrastructure costs  and marketing costs 
deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
see note  deferred compensation  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 
pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note  retirement benefit plans  in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
in addition  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees  including limited product warranties 
historically  costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 
issuer purchases of equity securities the purpose of the stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders  and has the effect 
table of contents of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions  the volume of employee stock option exercises  stock issuance  the trading price of our common stock  cash on hand and available in the us  and company defined trading windows 
there were million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january   during the fiscal year ended january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock 
at january   million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
this program does not have a fixed expiration date 
see note  stockholders equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
as of january  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately  million  if interest rates were to change by  this would result in a million change in annual interest income 
further  at january   we had approximately million invested in a longer term portfolio with remaining maturities that may be less than one year which  with and basis point moves  would result in market value changes gains or losses of million and million respectively  over a twelve month period
