item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please refer to note on forward looking statements and risk factors for more information 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an international insurance company focusing on specialty products within the overall property and casualty insurance market 
our largest product line and most long standing area of specialization is ocean marine insurance 
we have also developed specialty niches in professional liability insurance and in specialty liability insurance primarily consisting of contractors liability and commercial primary and excess casualty coverages 
our revenue is primarily comprised of premiums and investment income 
we derive our premiums primarily from business written by wholly owned underwriting management companies which produce  manage and underwrite insurance and reinsurance for us 
our products are distributed through multiple channels  utilizing global  national and regional retail and wholesale insurance brokers 
we conduct operations through our insurance companies and our lloyd s operations segments 
the insurance companies segment consists of navigators insurance company  which includes a united kingdom branch the uk branch  and navigators specialty insurance company  which underwrites specialty and professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis 
all of the insurance business written by navigators specialty insurance company is fully reinsured by navigators insurance company pursuant to a quota share reinsurance agreement 
our lloyd s operations segment includes navigators underwriting agency ltd 
nual  a lloyd s of london lloyd s underwriting agency which manages lloyd s syndicate syndicate 
our lloyd s operations primarily underwrite marine and related lines of business along with offshore energy  professional liability insurance and construction coverages for onshore energy business at lloyd s through syndicate we controlled of syndicate s stamp capacity for the  and underwriting years through our wholly owned subsidiary  navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
which is referred to as a corporate name in the lloyd s market 
we have also established underwriting agencies in antwerp  belgium  stockholm  sweden  and copenhagen  denmark  which underwrite risks pursuant to binding authorities with nual into syndicate while management takes into consideration a wide range of factors in planning our business strategy and evaluating results of operations  there are certain factors that management believes are fundamental to understanding how we are managed 
first  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as a primary goal  above premium growth 
management s assessment of our trends and potential growth in underwriting profit is the dominant factor in its decisions with respect to whether or not to expand a business line  enter into a new niche  product or territory or  conversely  to contract capacity in any business line 
in addition  management focuses on controlling the costs of our operations 
management believes that careful monitoring of the costs of existing operations and assessment of costs of potential growth opportunities are important to our profitability 
access to capital also has a significant impact on management s outlook for our operations 
the insurance companies operations and ability to grow their business and take advantage of market opportunities are constrained by regulatory capital requirements and rating agency assessments of capital adequacy 
similarly  the ability to grow our operations at lloyd s is subject to capital and operating requirements of lloyd s and the uk regulatory authorities 

table of contents management s decisions are also greatly influenced by access to specialized underwriting and claims expertise in our lines of business 
we have chosen to operate in specialty niches with certain common characteristics which we believe provide us with the opportunity to use our technical underwriting expertise in order to realize underwriting profit 
as a result  we have focused on underserved markets for businesses characterized by higher severity and lower frequency of loss where we believe our intellectual capital and financial strength bring meaningful value 
in contrast  we have avoided niches that we believe have a high frequency of loss activity and or are subject to a high level of regulatory requirements  such as workers compensation and personal automobile insurance  because we do not believe our technical underwriting expertise is of as much value in these types of businesses 
examples of niches that have the characteristics we look for include bluewater hull which provides coverage for physical damage to  for example  highly valued cruise ships  and directors and officers d o insurance which covers litigation exposure of a corporation s directors and officers 
these types of exposures require substantial technical expertise 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of severe claims on our results by conservative and detailed underwriting  prudent use of reinsurance and a balanced portfolio of risks 
for additional information regarding our business  refer to business overview  included herein 
ratings our ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the financial strength of the insurance companies and lloyd s 
financial strength ratings represent the opinions of the rating agencies on the financial strength of a company and its capacity to meet the obligations of insurance policies 
independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets 
the rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company  including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company 
these ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
such ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities 
we could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in the insurance companies or lloyd s financial strength ratings  including a possible reduction in demand for our products  higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets 
for the insurance companies  navigators insurance company and navigators specialty insurance company utilize the financial strength ratings from am best company am best and standard and poor s rating services s p for underwriting purposes 
navigators insurance company and navigators specialty insurance company are both rated a excellent stable outlook by am best and a strong negative outlook by s p 
syndicate utilizes the ratings from am best and s p for underwriting purposes which apply to all lloyd s syndicates 
lloyd s is rated a excellent stable outlook by am best and a strong stable outlook by s p 
debt ratings apply to short term and long term debt as well as preferred stock 
these ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of the principal and interest for our senior debt 
it is possible that  in the future  one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing debt ratings 
if one or more of our debt ratings were downgraded  we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted 
we utilize the senior debt ratings from s p 
our senior debt is rated bbb adequate negative outlook by s p 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the reporting period 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and lae including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of investment securities and accounting for lloyd s results 

table of contents reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves for losses and lae represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves include interpreting loss development activity  emerging economic and social trends  inflation  changes in the regulatory and judicial environment and changes in our operations  including changes in underwriting standards and claims handling procedures 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into account many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
our actuaries calculate indicated ibnr loss reserves for each line of business by underwriting year for major products principally using two standard actuarial methodologies which are projection or extrapolation techniques the loss ratio method and the bornheutter ferguson method 
in general the loss ratio method is used to calculate the ibnr for more recent underwriting years while the bornheutter ferguson method is used to calculate the ibnr for more mature underwriting years 
when appropriate such methodologies are supplemented by the loss development method and the frequency severity method  which are used to analyze and better comprehend loss development patterns and trends in the data when making selections and judgments 
each of these methodologies  which are described below  are generally applicable to both long tail and short tail lines of business depending on a variety of circumstances 
in utilizing these methodologies to develop our ibnr loss reserves  a key objective of management in making their final selections is to deliberate with our actuaries to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them 
this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain as it can be influenced by numerous factors including inflationary pressures medical and economic that affect the size of losses  judicial  regulatory  legislative  and legal decisions that affect insurers liabilities  changes in the frequency and severity of losses  changes in the underlying loss exposures of our policies  changes in our claims handling procedures 
there are instances in which facts and circumstances require a deviation from the general process described above 
three such instances relate to the ibnr loss reserve processes for our hurricanes losses  our hurricanes losses and our asbestos exposures  where extrapolation techniques are not applied  except in a limited way  given the unique nature of hurricane losses and limited population of marine excess policies with potential asbestos exposures 
in such circumstances  inventories of the policy limits exposed to losses coupled with reported losses are analyzed and evaluated principally by claims personnel and underwriters to establish ibnr loss reserves 
a brief summary of each actuarial method discussed above follows loss ratio method this method is based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
pursuant to the loss ratio method  ibnr loss reserves are calculated by multiplying the earned premium by an expected ultimate loss ratio to estimate the ultimate losses for each underwriting year  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserve amount 
the ultimate loss ratios applied are the company s best estimates for each underwriting year and are generally determined after evaluating a number of factors which include information derived by underwriters and actuaries in the initial pricing of the business  the ultimate loss ratios established in the prior accounting period and the related judgments applied  the ultimate loss ratios of previous underwriting years  premium rate changes  underwriting and coverage changes  changes in terms and conditions  legislative changes  exposure trends  loss development trends  claim frequency and severity trends  paid claims activity  remaining open case reserves and industry data where deemed appropriate 
such factors are also evaluated when selecting ultimate loss ratios and or loss development factors in the methods described below 

table of contents bornheutter ferguson method the bornheutter ferguson method calculates the ibnr loss reserves as the product of the earned premium  an expected ultimate loss ratio  and a loss development factor that represents the expected percentage of the ultimate losses that have been incurred but not yet reported 
the loss development factor equals one hundred percent less the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
the expected ultimate loss ratio is generally determined in the same manner as in the loss ratio method 
loss development method the loss development method  also known as the chainladder or the link ratio method  develops the ibnr loss reserves by multiplying the paid or reported losses by a loss development factor to estimate the ultimate losses  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserves 
the loss development factor is the reciprocal of the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
frequency severity method the frequency severity method calculates the ibnr loss reserves by separately projecting claim count and average cost per claim data on either a paid or incurred basis 
it estimates the expected ultimate losses as the product of the ultimate number of claims that are expected to be reported and the expected average amount of these claims 
annual actuarial loss studies are conducted by the company s actuaries at various times throughout the year for major lines of business employing the methodologies as described above 
additionally  a review of the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for each line of business  generally derived from the annual loss studies  is conducted each quarter to determine whether the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a reasonable basis for the projection of liabilities for each product line 
such reviews may result in maintaining or revising assumptions regarding future loss development based on various quantitative and qualitative considerations 
if actual loss activity differs from expectations  an upward or downward adjustment to loss reserves may occur 
as time passes  estimated loss reserves for an underwriting year will be based more on historical loss activity and loss development patterns rather than on assumptions based on underwriters input  pricing assumptions or industry experience 
the following discusses the method used for calculating the ibnr for each line of business and key assumptions used in applying the actuarial methods described 
marine generally  two key assumptions are used by our actuaries in setting ibnr loss reserves for major products in this line of business 
the first assumption is that our historical experience regarding paid and reported losses for each product where we have sufficient history can be relied on to predict future loss activity 
the second assumption is that our underwriters assessments as to potential loss exposures are reliable indicators of the level of our expected loss activity 
the specific loss reserves for marine are then analyzed separately by product based on such assumptions  except where noted below  with the major products including marine liability  cargo  p i  transport and bluewater hull 

table of contents the claims emergence patterns for various marine product lines vary substantially 
our largest marine product line is marine liability  which has one of the longer loss development patterns 
marine liability protects an insured s business from liability to third parties stemming from their marine related operations  such as terminal operations  stevedoring and marina operations 
since marine liability claims generally involve a dispute as to the extent and amount of legal liability that our insured has to a third party  these claims tend to take a longer time to develop and settle 
other longer tail marine product lines include p i insurance  which provides coverage for third party liability as well as injury to crew for vessel operators  and transport insurance  which provides both property and third party liability on a primary basis to businesses such as port authorities  marine terminal operators and others engaged in the infrastructure of international transportation 
other marine product lines have considerably shorter periods in which losses develop and settle 
ocean cargo insurance  for example  provides physical damage coverage to goods in the course of transit by water  air or land 
by their nature  cargo claims tend to be reported quickly as losses typically result from an obvious peril such as fire  theft or weather 
similarly  bluewater hull insurance provides coverage against physical damage to ocean going vessels 
such claims for physical damage generally are discovered  reported and settled quickly 
the company currently has extensive experience for all of these products and thus the ibnr loss reserves for all of the marine products are determined using the key assumptions and actuarial methodologies described above 
prior to  however  as discussed below  the company did not have sufficient experience in the transport product line and instead used its hull and liability products loss development experience as a key assumption in setting the ibnr loss reserves for its transport product 
property casualty the reserves for property and casualty are established separately by product with the major product being contractors liability insurance 
other products include offshore energy  commercial middle markets  primary casualty  excess casualty and specialty reinsurance 
our actuaries generally utilize two key assumptions in this line of business first  that our historical loss development patterns are reasonable predictors of future loss patterns and second  that our claims personnel s assessment of our claims exposures and our underwriters assessment of our expected losses are reliable indicators of our loss exposure 
however  this line of business includes a number of newer products where there is insufficient company historical experience to project loss reserves and or loss development is sparse or erratic  which makes extrapolation techniques for those products extremely difficult to apply  and in those circumstances we typically rely more on industry data and our underwriters input in setting assumptions for our ibnr loss reserves as opposed to historical loss development patterns 
in addition  as discussed in more detail below with respect to construction defect reserves  our actuaries may take other market trends or events into account in setting ibnr loss reserves 
the substantial majority of the property and casualty loss reserves are for the contractors liability business  which insures mostly general and artisan contractors 
contractor liability claims are categorized into two claim types construction defect and other general liability 
other general liability claims typically derive from workplace accidents or from negligence alleged by third parties  and frequently take a long time to report and settle 
construction defect claims involve the discovery of damage to buildings that was caused by latent construction defects 
these claims take a very long time to report and to settle compared to other general liability claims 
since construction defect claims report much later than other contractor liability claims  they are analyzed separately in an annual actuarial loss study 
we have extensive history in the contractors liability business upon which to perform actuarial analyses and we use the key assumption noted above relating to our own historical experience as a reliable indicator of the future for this product 
however  there is inherent uncertainty in the loss reserve estimation process for this line of business given both the long tail nature of the liability claims and the continuing underwriting and coverage changes  claims handling and reserve changes  and legislative changes that have occurred over a several year period 
such factors are judgmentally taken into account in this line of business in specific periods 
the underwriting and coverage changes include the migration to a non admitted business from admitted business in  which allowed us to exclude certain exposures previously permitted for example  exposure to construction work performed prior to the policy inception  withdrawals from certain contractor classes previously underwritten and expansion into new states beginning in claims changes include bringing the claim handling in house in and changes in case reserving practices in  and 
table of contents most recently  in setting the ibnr loss reserves for construction defect claims  our actuaries have begun to consider a new qualitative factor based on their evolving concern with the recent decline in home values caused by the subprime home mortgage crisis and its possible impact on the frequency and severity of construction defect claims 
as a result  our actuaries acknowledge this uncertainty and anticipate claims arising from alleged construction defects contributing to housing value declines on policies written on newly constructed homes in our portfolio 
we believe our reserves remain adequate to address such potential exposure  but we can give no assurances with respect thereto 
offshore energy provides physical damage coverage to offshore oil platforms along with offshore operations related to oil exploration and production 
the significant offshore energy claims are generally caused by fire or storms  and thus tend to be large  infrequent  quickly reported  but occasionally not quickly settled because the damage is often extensive but not always immediately known 
our commercial middle markets or nav pac business consists of general liability  auto liability and property exposures for a variety of commercial middle market businesses  principally hospitality  manufacturing and garages 
commencing in  our actuaries are segmenting and analyzing the components of the loss development for this business among the property  liability and auto exposures which had been previously combined 
as mentioned in part i  on january   we announced that we entered into a transaction for the sale of the renewal rights for our middle market commercial package and commercial automobile businesses underwritten through our nav pac division 
this transaction did not include our life sciences and exporters package liability products 
primary casualty insurance provides primary general liability coverage principally to corporations in the construction and manufacturing sector 
excess casualty insurance is purchased by corporations which seek higher limits of liability than are provided in their primary casualty policies 
our specialty reinsurance provides proportional and excess of loss treaty reinsurance covering medical health care exposures  property treaty exposures in central and south america and the caribbean and agriculture exposures in the us and canada 
neither of the product lines has a significant amount of loss activity reported to date 
because we have limited historical experience in these products  the ibnr loss reserves for these products are primarily established using the loss ratio method primarily based on our underwriters input and industry loss experience 
loss reserves include our european property business written by the uk branch which was discontinued in we have limited loss history and rely primarily on assumptions based on underwriters input and industry experience 
in addition  loss reserves for aviation  property and assumed reinsurance business  in run off since  are periodically monitored and evaluated by claims and actuarial personnel 
professional liability the professional liability policies mainly provide coverage on a claims made basis mostly for a one year period 
the reserves for professional liability are analyzed separately by product 
the major products are d o liability coverage and e o liability coverage for lawyers and other professionals 
the losses for d o business are generally very large and infrequent  and often involve securities class actions 
d o claims report reasonably quickly  but may take several years to settle 
our loss estimates are based on expected losses  an assessment of the characteristics of reported losses at the claim level  evaluation of loss trends  industry data  and the legal  regulatory and current risk environment 
significant judgment is involved because anticipated loss experience in this area is less predictable due to the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns 
as time passes for a given underwriting year  we place additional weight on assumptions relating to our actual experience and claims outstanding 
the expected ultimate losses may be adjusted up or down as the underwriting years mature 
the e o ibnr loss reserve process is similar to the process for d o  with the exception of a particular book of business of the uk branch written from through for the u 
k branch e o business  we assume the claims  while similar in nature to the claims in the us e o business  are larger  more frequent and have a longer loss development pattern 
the ibnr loss reserves for the uk branch e o business are determined judgmentally after reviewing recent loss activity relative to the remaining in force policy count and the loss activity for similar insureds 

table of contents lloyd s operations reserves for the company s lloyd s operations are reviewed separately for the marine and professional liability lines by product 
the major marine products are marine liability  offshore energy  cargo  specie and marine reinsurance  and the major products for professional liability are international d o and international e o 
the marine liability  offshore energy and cargo products and related loss exposures are similar in nature to that described for marine business above 
specie insurance provides property coverage for chattel  such as jewelry  fine art and cash in transit 
claims tend to be from theft or damage  quick to report and  in most cases  quick to settle 
marine reinsurance is a diversified global book of reinsurance  the majority of which consists of excess of loss reinsurance policies for which claims activity tends to be large and infrequent with loss development somewhat longer than for such products written on a direct basis 
marine reinsurance reinsures liability  cargo  hull and offshore energy exposures that are similar in nature to the marine business described above 
the process for establishing the ibnr loss reserves for the marine and professional liability lines of the lloyd s operations  and the assumptions used as part of this process  are similar in nature to the process employed by the insurance companies 
the lloyd s operations products also include property coverages for engineering and construction projects and onshore energy business  which are substantially reinsured 
losses from engineering and construction projects tend to result from loss of use due to construction delays while losses from onshore energy business are usually caused by fires or explosions 
large losses tend to be catastrophic in nature and are heavily reinsured 
ibnr loss reserves for attritional losses are established based on the syndicate s extensive loss experience 
sensitivity analysis we do not calculate a range of reasonable loss reserve estimates 
we believe that ranges may not be a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
the actual losses may not emerge as expected  which would cause the ranges to expand or contract from year to year 
the impact of these shifts in the ranges will be greater in lines with longer emergence patterns 
the individual lines will also have greater variance than the range for the entire book of business 
the boundaries of the reasonably likely ranges do not have a symmetrical relationship with our carried reserves and intentionally reflect a wider variation in the increases than for the decreases and  correspondingly  a wider deviation in the deficiency than in the redundancy 
set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that estimates the effect on our net loss reserve position of using alternative expected loss ratios for the underwriting years to and alternative loss development factors for underwriting years beginning in the late s to rather than those loss ratios and factors actually used in determining our best estimates as of december  the analysis addresses each major line of business and underwriting year for which a material deviation to our overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible  and uses what we believe is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each line of business 
there can be no assurance  however  that actual reserve development will be materially consistent with either the original or the adjusted expected loss ratios or loss development factor assumptions  or with other assumptions made in the reserving process 
for the selected alternative expected loss ratios  our actuaries observed the range of ultimate loss ratios recorded for the underwriting years to for each major line of business as of december  
table of contents the reasonably likely ranges of potential deviation in the loss ratios for each line of business for the to underwriting years expressed in loss ratio points are as follows reasonably likely loss ratio point variances decrease increase insurance companies marine property casualty professional liability lloyd s operations for the loss development factor variance  our actuaries employed a standard technique which is based on the historical development factors observed for each line of business from the paid and incurred loss development triangles with the latest evaluation as of december  the historical factors are used to generate alternative outcomes which could arise in the ultimate development due to the random variability inherent in future development 
the alternative outcomes are generated by a stochastic simulation 
the ranges may contract or expand if future development deviates from historical experience 
the reasonably likely ranges of potential deviations in the aggregate or overall loss development factors applicable to the total of all underwriting years for each line of business are as follows reasonably likely ultimate loss development factor ratios decrease increase insurance companies marine property casualty professional liability lloyd s operations such sensitivity analysis was performed in the aggregate for all products within each line of business 
the use of aggregate data was considered more stable and reliable compared to a product by product analysis 
we cannot assure  however  that such use of aggregate data will provide a more accurate range of the actual variations in loss development 
the loss ratio sensitivity analysis uses loss ratios for the to underwriting years  which are believed to be more representative compared to years prior to given our evolving mix of business  product changes and other factors 
there can be no assurances  however  that the use of such recent history is more predictive of actual development as compared to employing longer periods of history 
in addition  while the net loss reserves include the net loss reserves for asbestos exposures  such amounts were excluded from the sensitivity analysis given the nature of how such reserves are established by the company 
while we believe such net reserves are adequate  we cannot assure that material loss development may not arise in the future from asbestos losses given the complex nature of such exposures 

table of contents the total company range amounts below were determined by combining the simulated results for each line of business into one analysis which estimates a company wide range reflecting the fact that the individual lines of business are not perfectly correlated 
this calculation reflects the reduced volatility benefit from a diversified portfolio of loss exposures

reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
additional information regarding our reinsurance recoverables can be found in the business reinsurance recoverables section and note  reinsurance  to our consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
written and unearned premium written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
reinsurance reinstatement premium is earned in the period in which the event occurred which created the need to record the reinstatement premium 
additional information regarding our written and unearned premium can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  reinsurance  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  both included herein 

table of contents substantially all of our business is placed through agents and brokers 
since the majority of our gross written premiums are primary or direct  as opposed to assumed  the delays in reporting assumed premiums generally do not have a significant effect on our financial statements  as we record estimates for both unreported direct and assumed premium 
we also record the ceded portion of the estimated gross written premium and related acquisition costs 
the earned gross  ceded and net premiums are calculated based on our earning methodology which is generally pro rata over the policy period 
losses are also recorded in relation to the earned premium 
the estimate for losses incurred on the estimated premium is based on an actuarial calculation consistent with the methodology used to determine incurred but not reported loss reserves for reported premiums 
a portion of our premium is estimated for unreported premium  mostly for the marine business written by our uk branch and lloyd s operations as well as the accident and health reinsurance business written by our recently established reinsurance division nav re 
we generally do not experience any significant backlog in processing premiums 
such premium estimates are generally based on submission data received from brokers and agents and recorded when the insurance policy or reinsurance contract is written or bound 
the estimates are regularly reviewed and updated taking into account the premium received to date versus the estimate and the age of the estimate 
to the extent that the actual premium varies from the estimates  the difference  along with the related loss reserves and underwriting expenses  is recorded in current operations 
deferred tax assets we apply the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
additional information regarding our deferred tax assets can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
impairment of invested assets management regularly reviews our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
for fixed maturity securities  we consider our intent to sell a security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before the anticipated recovery as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
we assess whether the amortized cost basis of a fixed maturity security will be recovered by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the current book value 
any shortfalls of the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected in relation to the amortized cost basis is considered the credit loss portion of other than temporary impairment otti losses and is recognized in earnings 
all non credit losses are recognized as changes in otti losses within other comprehensive income oci 
for equity securities  in general  we focus our attention on those securities whose fair value was less than of their cost for six or more consecutive months 
if warranted as the result of conditions relating to a particular security  we will focus on a significant decline in fair value regardless of the time period involved 
factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost of the security  the length of time the investment has been below cost and the impact of the amount 
if an equity security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  the cost is written down to fair value with the loss recognized in earnings 
for equity securities  we also consider our intent to hold securities as part of the process of evaluating whether a decline in fair value represents an other than temporary decline in value 
for fixed maturity securities  we consider our intent to sell a security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before the anticipated recovery as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
our ability to hold such securities is evaluated by the company and is based on whether there is sufficient cash flow from operations and from maturities within our investment portfolio in order to meet claims payment and other disbursement obligations arising from our underwriting operations without selling such investments 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information and market conditions 

table of contents the day to day management of our investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers 
while these investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss based upon a change in the market and other factors described above 
investment managers are required to notify management of rating agency downgrades of securities in their portfolios as well as any potential investment valuation issues at the end of each quarter 
investment managers are also required to notify management  and receive approval  prior to the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in a realized loss above a certain threshold 
additionally  management monitors the execution of a transaction or series of related transactions that may result in any realized loss up until a certain period beyond the close of a quarterly accounting period

additional information regarding our accounting for lloyd s results can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the years ended december   and in presenting our financial results  we discuss our performance with reference to operating earnings  book value per share  underwriting profit or loss  and the combined ratio  all of which are non gaap financial measures of performance and or underwriting profitability 
operating earnings is calculated as net income less after tax net realized gains losses and net other than temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings 
book value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders equity by the number of outstanding shares at any period end 
underwriting profit or loss is calculated from net earned premiums  less the sum of net losses and lae  commission expenses  other operating expenses and other income expense 
the combined ratio is derived by dividing the sum of net losses and lae  commission expenses  other operating expenses and other income expense by net earned premiums 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit and over indicates an underwriting loss 
we consider such measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  to be important in the understanding of our overall results of operations by highlighting the underlying profitability of our insurance business

the remaining million of emergence was specific to our small lawyers and miscellaneous professional liability coverages 

table of contents an increase in our reinsurance reinstatement premium accrual of million 
this accrual was driven by the recognition of the effect of a shift in our marine reinsurance protections to an excess of loss program from a quota share program 
as a result of this shift and the increased frequency of severity losses in recent periods  a greater portion of our ibnr was attributable to marine and energy losses that are or will be ceded to our marine excess of loss reinsurance program and such cession will trigger additional reinstatement premiums 
net adverse loss development of million driven by significant loss emergence in our professional liability business mostly offset by redundancies from our property casualty business

the increase within property casualty is also attributable to growth of million and million excess and primary casualty business  respectively  resulting from strong production  partially offset by the run off of our middle market commercial package business 
the increase in gross written premiums was offset by a million decrease in our professional liability business attributable to our directors and officer liability lines 
this decrease reflects a change in our underwriting strategy that focuses on a planned shift toward underwriting excess layers 

table of contents gross written premiums decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to billion for the same period in the decreases in gross written premiums were primarily attributable to our marine and property casualty businesses 
the decline in marine gross written premiums is attributed to significant competition in this line of business coupled with excess capacity 
property casualty gross written premiums declined primarily due to weak economic conditions that had reduced demand for construction liability insurance 
our marine division saw increases in the average renewal premium rates in our inland marine and lloyd s lines of approximately and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in us marine premiums rates decreased while us branch marine premiums rates increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in for our navigators technical risk navtech and primary casualty lines we experienced an average renewal premium rate increases of approximately and for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  which was offset by a decline in our excess casualty lines of  respectively

the insurance companies and lloyd s professional liability division overall experienced approximately decrease in average renewal premium rates for the year ended december  compared to the average premium rate increases or decreases as noted above for the marine  property casualty and professional liability businesses are calculated primarily by comparing premium amounts on policies that have renewed 
the premiums are judgmentally adjusted for exposure factors when deemed significant and sometimes represent an aggregation of several lines of business 
the rate change calculations provide an indicated pricing trend and are not meant to be a precise analysis of the numerous factors that affect premium rates or the adequacy of such rates to cover all underwriting costs and generate an underwriting profit 
the calculation can also be affected quarter by quarter depending on the particular policies and the number of policies that renew during that period 
due to market conditions  these rate changes may or may not apply to new business that generally would be more competitively priced compared to renewal business 
the calculation does not reflect the rate on business that we are unwilling or unable to renew due to loss experience or competition 
ceded written premiums in the ordinary course of business  we reinsure certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting our maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the relationship of ceded to written premium varies based upon the types of business written and whether the business is written by the insurance companies or the lloyd s operations 
our reinsurance program includes contracts for proportional reinsurance  per risk and whole account excess of loss reinsurance for both property and casualty risks and property catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance 
in recent years we have increased our utilization of excess of loss reinsurance for marine  property and casualty risks 
our excess of loss reinsurance contracts generally provide for a specific amount of coverage in excess of an attachment point and sometimes provides for reinstatement of the coverage to the extent the limit has been exhausted for payment of additional premium referred to as reinstatement premiums 
the number of reinstatements available varies by contract 
we record an estimate of the expected reinstatement premiums for losses ceded to excess of loss agreements where this feature applies

the increase in the percentage of total ceded written premiums to total gross written premiums for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to the shift in business mix toward lines with lower cessions  offset by the impact of reinsurance reinstatement costs of million and million resulting from the deepwater horizon and west atlas losses  respectively 
net written premiums net written premiums increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase is due to the impact of higher gross written premiums for the year ended december   and to a lesser extent lower premium cessions  as discussed above 
net written premiums decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to the reduction in gross written premiums partially offset by the decline in ceded written premiums discussed above 
net earned premiums net earned premiums increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily as a result of significant ceded reinstatement premiums associated with large losses in as noted above  we recorded approximately million in reinstatement premiums associated with large losses in compared to million in the impact of reinstatement premiums was partially offset by a change in the mix of business in written by nav re  specifically the accident and health lines  which are recognized in earnings over a longer exposure period that our other lines of business

the ocean marine development was driven by million of favorable development in accident years to and was partially offset by million of adverse development for accident years and prior 
ocean marine s favorable development was driven by the craft  p i and transport classes with partial offsets from the specie and liability classes 

table of contents our insurance companies property casualty business experienced million of favorable development overall which was driven by favorable development of million from offshore energy across several accident years and was partially offset by adverse development from runoff liquor liability in accident years and our insurance companies professional liability business had overall adverse development of million  which consisted of adverse development of million and million from management liability and errors and omissions  respectively 
the management liability development was primarily driven by liability coverage of public company directors and officers for accident years and the errors and omissions development was driven by small lawyers professional liability and miscellaneous professional liability classes for accident year our lloyd s operations experienced million of favorable development 
this was driven by favorable development of million and million from the marine and nav tech divisions respectively  which was partially offset by million of unfavorable development from professional liability 
the favorable development in marine was primarily from the cargo  liability and specie classes for accident years and prior 
the favorable development in nav tech was from offshore energy primarily in accident years to the adverse development in professional liability was mostly from errors and omissions in accident years to the following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our million net reserve redundancies for the year ended december  the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year favorable development for the marine business  of which million arose in the marine liability business due to favorable loss emergence relative to our expectations and million in hull as we eliminated ibnr in older underwriting years where we determined the year had been fully reported and saw case reserve reductions on a number of claims

million for new york construction liability due to unfavorable loss emergence 

table of contents the insurance companies recorded million of net prior year unfavorable development for professional liability the directors and officers liability book of business had million of adverse development  which was primarily attributable to a severity study of our open claims completed during the fourth quarter 
this study showed our ibnr to be significantly deficient if current trends continued and we raised our loss estimates for underwriting years to this was partially offset by million of favorable development on a run off lawyers book of business written from london where we saw favorable settlements of outstanding claims and million of favorable development on other lawyers business mostly due to a favorable claim reserve settlement 
the lloyd s operations recorded million in favorable loss development for prior years during this included favorable development of million in marine  million in navtech  and million in all other areas 
the marine favorable development was primarily from the and underwriting years and was driven by loss development on these underwriting years being more favorable than our expectations  particularly in marine liability  assumed reinsurance  and specie classes

this loss activity was inconsistent with the loss emergence trends that we observed in calendar years and and it caused us to increase our ultimate loss projections in the and prior underwriting years  as well as those in the more current underwriting years 
the lawyers liability book of business had adverse development of million due to reported loss activity in underwriting years to in excess of our prior expectations 

table of contents the lloyd s operations recorded million of net favorable development which included million on marine business concentrated in the liability  specie and cargo books due to reported losses being less than our expectations in underwriting years to and million on offshore energy business due to favorable loss trends in several years  partially offset by million of adverse loss development in the professional liability books due to reported loss activity in excess of our expectations in the lawyers liability book of business for losses occurring in and million in the property book due to an extension in the loss development pattern for the and underwriting years

as those balances have run off and the amounts were fully realized the bad debt reserve has been released back into our general reserve with no change to the overall balance  it has just been reclassified 
asbestos liability our exposure to asbestos liability principally stems from marine liability insurance written on an occurrence basis during the mid s 
in general  our participation on such risks is in the excess layers  which requires the underlying coverage to be exhausted prior to coverage being triggered in our layer 
in many instances we are one of many insurers who participate in the defense and ultimate settlement of these claims  and we are generally a minor participant in the overall insurance coverage and settlement 
the reserves for asbestos exposures as of december  are for i one large settled claim for excess insurance policy limits exposed to a class action suit against an insured involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products being paid over several years two other large settled claims were fully paid in  ii other insureds not directly involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products  but that have more than incidental asbestos exposure for their purchase or use of products that contained asbestos  and iii attritional asbestos claims that could be expected to occur over time 
substantially all of our asbestos liability reserves are included in our marine loss reserves 
we believe that there are no remaining known claims where we would suffer a material loss as a result of excess policy limits being exposed to class action suits for insureds involved in the manufacturing or distribution of asbestos products 

table of contents there can be no assurances  however  that material loss development may not arise in the future from existing asbestos claims or new claims given the evolving and complex legal environment that may directly impact the outcome of the asbestos exposures of our insureds

commissions are generally deferred and recorded as deferred policy acquisition costs to the extent that they relate to unearned premium 
the percentage of commission expenses to net earned premiums commission expense ratio for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in the commission expense ratio for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in can be attributed to the impact of reinsurance reinstatement premiums recorded in  which reduce net earned premiums and in turn increase the commission expense ratio in the increase in commission expense ratio for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in was mostly attributable to greater retentions for net premiums earned in for the underwriting year  particularly on our marine quota share treaties  which have reduced the ceding commission benefit  as well as the impact of reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to large loss activity in other operating expenses other operating expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in stock grant expense related to performance based awards that are not expected to vest partially offset by increased expenses for continued investments in new underwriting teams

the effective tax rate on net investment income was  and for the years ended december   and respectively 
as of december   the net deferred federal  foreign  state and local tax liabilities were million  compared to net deferred tax assets of million as of december  with the change primarily due to the increase in the deferred tax liability for net unrealized gains on securities 
refer to footnote  income taxes  included herein  for further detail on the temporary differences that give rise to federal  foreign  state and local deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we had net state and local deferred tax assets amounting to potential future tax benefits of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
included in the deferred tax assets are state and local net operating loss carry forwards of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of these potential future tax benefits due to uncertainty associated with their realization 
our state and local tax carry forwards as of december  expire from to segment information we classify our business into two underwriting segments consisting of the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations  which are separately managed  and a corporate segment 
segment data for each of the two underwriting segments include allocations of the operating expenses of the wholly owned underwriting management companies and the navigator s group  inc s the parent company s operating expenses and related income tax amounts 
the corporate segment consists of the parent company s investment income  interest expense and the related tax effect 
we evaluate the performance of each segment based on its underwriting and gaap results 
the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations results are measured by taking into account net earned premium  net loss and loss adjustment expenses  commission expenses  other operating expenses and other income expense 
the corporate segment consists of the parent company s investment income  interest expense and the related tax effect 
each segment also maintains its own investments  on which it earns income and realizes capital gains or losses 
our underwriting performance is evaluated separately from the performance of our investment portfolios 
following are the financial results of our two underwriting segments 
insurance companies the insurance companies consist of navigators insurance  including its uk branch  and its wholly owned subsidiary  navigators specialty 
they are primarily engaged in underwriting marine insurance and related lines of business  professional liability insurance and specialty lines of business including contractors general liability insurance  commercial umbrella and primary and excess casualty businesses

includes interest payments capital resources we monitor our capital adequacy to support our business on a regular basis 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our insurance companies to compete  sufficient capital to enable our insurance companies to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the united states and the united kingdom and letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary to support the business plan of our lloyd s operations

the credit facility is a letter of credit facility and replaces a million credit facility agreement that expired march  the credit facility  which is denominated in us dollars  will be utilized to fund our participation in syndicate through letters of credit for the and underwriting years  as well as open prior years 
the letters of credit issued under the facility are denominated in british pounds and their aggregate face amount will fluctuate based on exchange rates 
the ability to issue new letters of credit expired on december  if any letters of credit remain outstanding under the facility after december   we would be required to post additional collateral to secure the remaining letters of credit 
as of december   letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million were outstanding under the credit facility 
this credit facility contains customary covenants for facilities of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on mergers  dividends and the sale of assets  and requirements as to maintaining certain consolidated tangible net worth  statutory surplus and other financial ratios 
the credit facility also provides for customary events of default  including failure to pay principal  interest or fees when due  failure to comply with covenants  any representation or warranty made by the company being false in any material respect  default under certain other indebtedness  certain insolvency or receivership events affecting the company and its subsidiaries  the occurrence of certain material judgments  or a change in control of the company 
the letter of credit facility is secured by a pledge of the stock of certain insurance subsidiaries of the company 
to the extent the aggregate face amount issued under the credit facility exceeds the commitment amount  we are required to post collateral with the lead bank of the consortium 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of december  as a result of the april  replacement of the expiring credit facility  the applicable margin and applicable fee rate payable under the letter of credit facility are now based on a tiered schedule that is based on the company s then current ratings issued by s p and moody s with respect to the company s senior unsecured long term debt securities  without third party credit enhancement  and the amount of the company s own funds at lloyd s collateral 
time lags do occur in the normal course of business between the time gross loss reserves are paid by the company and the time such gross paid losses are billed and collected from reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverable amounts related to those gross loss reserves as of december  are anticipated to be billed and collected over the next several years as the gross loss reserves are paid by the company 

table of contents generally  for pro rata or quota share reinsurers  we issue quarterly settlement statements for premiums less commissions and paid loss activity  which are expected to be settled by the end of the subsequent quarter 
we have the ability to issue cash calls requiring such reinsurers to pay losses whenever paid loss activity for a claim ceded to a particular reinsurance treaty exceeds a predetermined amount generally million as set forth in the pro rata treaty 
for the insurance companies  cash calls must generally be paid within calendar days 
there is generally no specific settlement period for the lloyd s operations cash call provisions  but such billings have historically on average been paid within calendar days 
generally  for excess of loss reinsurers we pay monthly or quarterly deposit premiums based on the estimated subject premiums over the contract period usually one year that are subsequently adjusted based on actual premiums determined after the expiration of the applicable reinsurance treaty 
paid losses subject to excess of loss recoveries are generally billed as they occur and are usually settled by reinsurers within calendar days for the insurance companies and business days for the lloyd s operations 
we sometimes withhold funds from reinsurers and may apply ceded loss billings against such funds in accordance with the applicable reinsurance agreements 
liquidity consolidated cash flows cash flow from operations was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from operations was due to improved collections on reinsurance recoverable as well as premium receivable 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to the sale of securities from the ongoing management of our investment portfolio 
for the years ended december  and we reported net cash used by investing activities of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily related to the repurchase of the parent company s common stock under our share repurchase program 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and the increase in the use of cash is primarily related to the repurchase of the parent company s common stock under our share repurchase program 
we believe that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
we believe that we have adequately managed our cash flow requirements related to reinsurance recoveries from its positive cash flows and the use of available short term funds when applicable 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to adequately manage such recoveries in the future or that collection disputes or reinsurer insolvencies will not arise that could materially increase the collection time lags or result in recoverable write offs causing additional incurred losses and liquidity constraints to the company 
the payment of gross claims and related collections from reinsurers with respect to large losses could significantly impact our liquidity needs 
however  we expect to collect our paid reinsurance recoverables generally under the terms described above

table of contents we analyze the unrealized losses quarterly to determine if any are other than temporary 
the above unrealized losses have been determined to be temporary based on our policies 
in the above table the gross unrealized loss for the greater than months category consists primarily of residential mortgage backed securities 
residential mortgage backed securities are a type of fixed income security in which residential mortgage loans are sold into a trust or special purpose vehicle  thereby securitizing the cash flows of the mortgage loans 
to determine whether the unrealized loss on structured securities is other than temporary  we project an expected principal loss under a range of scenarios and utilize the most likely outcomes 
the analysis relies on actual collateral performance measures such as default rate  prepayment rate and loss severity 
these assumptions are applied throughout the remaining term of the deal  incorporating the transaction structure and priority of payments  to generate loss adjusted cash flows 
results of the analysis will indicate whether the security ultimately incurs a loss or whether there is a material impact on yield due to either a projected loss or a change in cash flow timing 
a break even default rate is also calculated 
a comparison of the break even default rate to the actual default rate provides an indication of the level of cushion or coverage to the first dollar principal loss 
the analysis applies the stated assumptions throughout the remaining term of the transaction to forecast cash flows  which are then applied through the transaction structure to determine whether there is a loss to the security 
for securities in which a tranche loss is present  and the net present value of loss adjusted cash flows is less than book value  an impairment is recognized 
the output data also includes a number of additional metrics such as average life remaining  original and current credit support  over day delinquency and security rating 
prepayment assumptions associated with the mortgage based and asset backed securities are reviewed on a periodic basis 
when changes in prepayment assumptions are deemed necessary as the result of actual prepayments differing from anticipated prepayments  securities are revalued based upon the new prepayment assumptions utilizing the retrospective accounting method 
as of december   the largest single unrealized loss by issuer in the fixed maturities was million

during the comparable periods in and  we recognized otti losses of million and million  respectively  related to residential mortgage backed securities and equity securities 
the significant inputs used to measure the amount of credit loss recognized in earnings were actual delinquency rates  default probability assumptions  severity assumptions and prepayment assumptions 
projected losses are a function of both loss severity and probability of default 
default probability and severity assumptions differ based on property type  vintage and the stress of the collateral 
we do not intend to sell any of these securities and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential loss to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures have been managed through december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading and speculation 
the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december  was billion of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
we do not have any commodity risk exposure 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended december  we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a and basis points change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will decrease 
conversely  as interest rates fall  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will increase 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  
table of contents the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our portfolio as of december  interest rate shift in basis points in thousands december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value equity price risk our portfolio of equity securities currently valued at million  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
our us equity portfolio is benchmarked to the s p index and changes in that index may approximate the impact on our portfolio
