overview we are a supplier of automotive replacement parts and fasteners and service line products primarily for the automotive aftermarket 
we market approximately  different automotive replacement parts including brake parts  fasteners and service line products manufactured to our specifications 
approximately of our parts and of our net sales consists of parts and fasteners that were original equipment dealer exclusive items at the time of their introduction 
original equipment dealer exclusive parts are those which were traditionally available to consumers only from original equipment manufacturers or salvage yards and include  among other parts  intake manifolds  exhaust manifolds  oil cooler lines  window regulators  radiator fan assemblies  power steering pulleys and harmonic balancers 
fasteners include such items as oil drain plugs and wheel lug nuts 
approximately of our products are sold under our brand names and the remainder is sold for resale under customers private labels  other brands or in bulk 
our products are sold primarily in the united states through automotive aftermarket retailers such as autozone  advance auto and o reilly  national  regional and local warehouse distributors such as carquest and napa and specialty markets and salvage yards 
we distribute automotive replacements parts internationally  with sales in europe  the middle east  asia and canada 
we generate over of our revenues from customers in the north american automotive aftermarket 
the aftermarket has benefited from some of the factors affecting the general economy including the recent recession  tighter credit and higher unemployment 
these conditions as well as others have resulted in consumers holding onto their vehicles longer as the average age of a vehicle on the road has increased to years 
this trend  if it continues  will increase the number of automotive aftermarket parts that need replacing 
another important statistic impacting our market is total miles driven 
total us miles driven increased slightly in and  but declined in we believe that the combination of these factors accounted for a portion of our sales growth 
while the overall automotive aftermarket in which we compete has benefited from the conditions mentioned above  our customer base has been consolidating over the past several years 
as a result  our customers regularly seek more favorable pricing  product returns and extended payment terms when negotiating with us 
while we attempt to avoid or minimize such concessions  in some cases pricing concessions have been made  customer payment terms have been extended and returns of product have exceeded historical levels 
the product returns and more favorable pricing primarily affect our profit levels while terms extensions generally reduce operating cash flow and require additional capital to finance the business 
we expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future 
we expect our customers to continue to exert pressure on our margins 
we have increased our focus on efficiency improvements and product cost reduction initiatives to offset the impact of further price pressures 
refer to results of operations below for a comparison of our  and results 
in addition  we are relying on new product development as a way to offset some of these customer demands and as our primary vehicle for growth 
as such  new product development is a critical success factor for us 
we have invested heavily in resources necessary for us to increase our new product development efforts and to strengthen our relationships with our customers 
these investments are primarily in the form of increased product development resources and awareness programs and customer service improvements 
this has enabled us to provide an expanding array of new product offerings and grow our revenues 

table of contents on september   we announced our plan to exit the international portion of our scantech business which is headquartered outside stockholm  sweden and markets and distributes a line of volvo and saab replacement parts throughout the world 
as part of the exit  scantech s north american business  which is currently serviced from sweden  will be transferred to one of our us distribution centers while scantech s international business will be offered for sale or liquidated 
the exit process is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of fiscal we may experience significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter in our results of operations due to the timing of orders placed by our customers 
generally  the second and third quarters have the highest level of customer orders 
the introduction of new products and product lines to customers may cause significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter 
we operate on a fifty two  fifty three week period ending on the last saturday of the calendar year 
the fiscal year ended on december  was a fifty three week period 
the fiscal years ended december  and december  were fifty two week periods 
asset write downs as a result of our decision to exit the international portion of our scantech business in fiscal  we recorded charges to write down the value of inventory by approximately million and tooling by approximately million  which have been recorded in costs of goods sold 
additionally  we recorded million in charges for asset write downs and employee related costs  which have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that certain acquired intangible assets were impaired 
as such  we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal to fully write off these assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations percentage of net sales years ended december  december  december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before taxes provision for taxes net income fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our revenue growth was driven by overall strong demand for our products  higher new product sales and the impact of one additional week s sales in fiscal excluding the additional one week of sales  net sales growth was in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in fiscal from in the same period last year 
in fiscal  we recorded million of inventory and other write downs due to our exit of the international portion of our scantech business 
the remaining increase was the result of higher product return costs  an unfavorable change in sales mix and additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the spending increase was the result of higher variable costs related to our sales increase as well as increased new product development investment 
in addition  we recorded charges of million related to accounts receivable write downs  asset impairments and employee related costs in connection with our decision to exit the international portion our scantech business 
partially offsetting these charges were lower incentive compensation expenses 
additionally  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write off certain intangible assets 

table of contents interest expense  net  was million in fiscal and fiscal our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the effect of lower provisions for state income taxes and the fiscal receipt of tax exempt life insurance proceeds used to fund an officer s death benefit 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our revenue growth was driven by overall strong demand for our products and higher new product sales 
cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in fiscal from in the same period last year 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in certain material costs along with lower defective return costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the spending increase is the result of higher variable costs related to our sales increase  increased new product development spending and a million charge to write off certain intangible assets 
interest expense  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to lower borrowing levels 
our effective tax rate decreased to in from in the prior year 
the decrease was the result of lower provisions for state income taxes in liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our growth through a combination of cash flow from operations  accounts receivable sales programs provided by certain customers and through the issuance of senior indebtedness through our bank credit facility and senior note agreements 
at december   working capital was million  and shareholders equity was million 
at december   we had no long term debt or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  was million 
over the past several years we have continued to extend payment terms to certain customers as a result of customer requests and market demands 
these extended terms have resulted in increased accounts receivable levels and significant uses of cash flow 
we participate in accounts receivable sales programs with several customers which allow us to sell our accounts receivable to financial institutions to offset the negative cash flow impact of these payment terms extensions 
during fiscal and fiscal  we sold approximately million and million  respectively  under these programs 
we expect continued pressure to extend our payment terms for the foreseeable future 
further extensions of customer payment terms will result in additional uses of cash flow or increased costs associated with the sale of accounts receivable 
we have a million revolving credit facility which expires in june borrowings under the facility are on an unsecured basis with interest at rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points based upon the achievement of certain benchmarks related to the ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the interest rate at december  was libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  as of december   we had three letters of credit for approximately million in the aggregate which were issued to secure ordinary course of business transactions 
we had approximately million available under the facility at december  net of these letters of credit 
the loan agreement also contains covenants  the most restrictive of which pertain to net worth and the ratio of debt to ebitda 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements our business activities do not include the use of unconsolidated special purpose entities  and there are no significant business transactions that have not been reflected in the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have future obligations for future minimum rental and similar commitments under noncancellable operating leases as well as contingent obligations related to outstanding letters of credit 
these obligations as of december  are summarized in the tables below in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total amount committed less than year years years after years letters of credit we have excluded from the table above unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment 
as of december   the company has gross unrecognized tax benefits of million see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
we reported a net source of cash from our operating activities of million in the year ended december  net income  depreciation and a million decrease in inventory were the primary sources of operating cash flow 
accounts receivable and accounts payable were the primary uses of cash 
accounts receivable increased million due primarily to higher sales levels 
accounts payable decreased million due to lower inventory levels 
investing activities used million of cash in fiscal as a result of additions to property  plant and equipment 
capital spending in fiscal consisted of tooling associated with new products  upgrades to information systems  expansion of our facilities and scheduled equipment replacements 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we began a project to replace our enterprise resource planning system 
this project is expected to cost approximately million in software  installation services and capitalized internal costs in through through december   we have spent million on the project  of which million was spent in fiscal no disruption to our operations is anticipated 
in addition  we expanded our distribution facility located in warsaw  kentucky 
the total cost of this expansion was approximately million  of which million was spent in fiscal financing activities were neither a source or use of cash in the year ended december  the net effect of stock option activity and the repurchase of common stock from our k plan during was not significant 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our sources of available capital are adequate to meet our ongoing cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
foreign currency fluctuations in fiscal  approximately of our products were purchased from vendors in a variety of foreign countries 
the products generally are purchased through purchase orders with the purchase price specified in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have exposure to fluctuations in the relationship between the dollar and various foreign currencies between the time of execution of the purchase order and payment for the product 
to the extent that the dollar decreases in value relative to foreign currencies in the future  the price of the product in dollars for new purchase orders may increase 
the largest portion of our overseas purchases is from china 
since june  the value of the chinese yuan has increased approximately relative to the us dollar 
a continued increase in the value of the yuan relative to the us dollar will likely result in an increase in the cost of products that we purchase from china 
impact of inflation the overall impact of inflation has not resulted in a significant change in labor costs or the cost of general services utilized 
the cost of many commodities that are used in our products increased during the first six months of fiscal as a result  material costs increased in the latter part of we have experienced increased transportation costs over the past twelve months as a result of higher fuel prices 
we will attempt to offset future cost increases by passing along selling price increases to customers  through the use of alternative suppliers and by resourcing purchases to other countries 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 

table of contents related party transactions we have a noncancelable operating lease for our primary operating facility from a partnership in which steven l 
berman  our chairman and chief executive officer  and his family members are partners 
total annual rental payments each year to the partnership under the lease arrangement was million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our audit committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions 
in the opinion of our audit committee  the terms and rates of this lease are no less favorable than those which could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  customer credits  inventories  goodwill and income taxes 
estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be accurate and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates due to different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a significant percentage of our accounts receivable have been  and will continue to be  concentrated among a relatively small number of automotive retailers and warehouse distributors in the united states 
our five largest customers accounted for and of net accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
a bankruptcy or financial loss associated with a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
revenue recognition and allowance for customer credits 
revenue is recognized from product sales when goods are shipped  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection is reasonably assured 
we record estimates for cash discounts  product returns and warranties  discounts and promotional rebates in the period of the sale customer credits 
the provision for customer credits is recorded as a reduction from gross sales and reserves for customer credits are shown as a reduction of accounts receivable 
actual customer credits have not differed materially from estimated amounts for each period presented 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
costs associated with shipping and handling are included in cost of goods sold 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
we must make estimates of potential future excess and obsolete inventory costs 
we provide reserves for discontinued and excess inventory based upon historical demand  forecasted usage  estimated customer requirements and product line updates 
we maintain contact with our customer base in order to understand buying patterns  customer preferences and the life cycle of our products 
changes in customer requirements are factored into the reserves as needed 
goodwill 
in fiscal  we assessed the qualitative factors which could affect the fair values of our reporting units and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of each reporting unit was less than its carrying account 
in fiscal  we employed a market comparable approach in conducting our annual impairment test  using earnings multiples of to times ebitda 
income taxes 
we follow the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes takes into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset takes into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
substantially all of our available credit and accounts receivable sale programs bear interest rates tied to libor 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility and customer sponsored programs to sell accounts receivable  a change in either the lender s base rate  libor or discount rates under the accounts receivable sale programs would affect the rate at which we could borrow funds thereunder 
a one percentage point increase in libor or the discount rates on the accounts receivable sale programs would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt  if any  and accounts receivable financing costs by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal this estimate assumes that our variable rate debt balance and the level of sales of accounts receivable remains constant for an annual period and the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions may be different from what actually occurs in the future 
we have historically and do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in interest rates or commodity prices 
we are not exposed to any significant market risks  foreign currency exchange risks  or interest rate risks from the use of derivative instruments 
at december   we had two foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward million swedish krona to receive approximately million 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of approximately  at december  we did not hold any foreign exchange forward contracts at december
