our uk based operations acquired on august  contributed million of the increased revenues and million of the increased gross margin for fiscal while we believe conditions have become more stable and overall we experienced improvement in both sales and profitability during fiscal as compared to the prior year  us and global economic conditions remain volatile as high unemployment levels and overall economic conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and the level of consumer discretionary spending 
furthermore  we believe we are in the early phase of a replenishment cycle in men s apparel that is driven by a silhouette change in men s suits that occurs about every ten years 
about years ago  the cycle was driven by wide shouldered and double breasted suits  and about ten years later it was driven by the three button suit 
we are now seeing a much trimmer shape in men s suits that is also influencing shirts and ties 
we plan to feature these products in our stores and our marketing channels to target the younger customer as well as the other demographics that will be influenced by the silhouette change that we believe is driving this replenishment cycle in men s apparel

in addition  we will use cash to fund capital expenditures  income tax and dividend payments  operating leases and various other obligations  including the commitments discussed in the contractual obligations table below  as they arise 

table of contents capital expenditures are anticipated to be in the range of to million for this amount includes the anticipated costs of opening approximately new men s wearhouse stores and three new moores stores in the average cost excluding telecommunications and point of sale equipment and inventory of opening a new store is expected to be approximately million in the balance of the capital expenditures for will be used for telecommunications  point of sale and other computer equipment and systems  store relocations  remodeling and expansion  distribution facilities  investment in our corporate uniform program and investment in other corporate assets 
the company anticipates that each of the new men s wearhouse stores and each of the three new moores stores will require  on average  an initial inventory costing approximately million subject to the seasonal patterns that affect inventory at all stores 
these inventory purchases will be funded by cash from operations  trade credit and  if necessary  borrowings under our credit agreement 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased  as well as on industry trends consistent with our anticipated operating plans 
additionally  market conditions may produce attractive opportunities for us to make acquisitions larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores 
we may use cash on hand  together with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit agreement and issuances of debt or equity securities  to take advantage of any significant acquisition opportunities 
current domestic and global economic conditions  including high unemployment levels  reduced public sector spending and constrained credit markets  could negatively affect our future operating results as well as our existing cash and cash equivalents balances 
in addition  conditions in the financial markets could limit our access to additional capital resources  if needed  and could increase associated costs 
we believe based on our current business plan that our existing cash and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned store openings  relocations and remodelings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements  and that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement for at least the next months 
borrowings available under our credit agreement were million as of january  we are exposed to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as a result of our direct sourcing programs and our operations in foreign countries 
in connection with our direct sourcing programs  we may enter into merchandise purchase commitments that are denominated in a currency different from the functional currency of the operating entity 
our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for our direct sourcing programs that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward contracts 
as these foreign exchange forward contracts are with three financial institutions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by these parties 
however  due to the creditworthiness of these major financial institutions  full performance is anticipated

leases on retail business locations specify minimum base rentals plus common area maintenance charges and possible additional rentals based upon percentages of sales 
most of the retail business location leases provide for renewal options at rates specified in the leases 
our future lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

off balance sheet arrangements other than the noncancelable operating leases  other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations 
inflation the company believes the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model 
however  because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
our critical accounting policies  which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management  are discussed below 
revenue recognition clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise  net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns  and excludes sales taxes 
revenues from tuxedo rental  alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services 

table of contents we present all non income government assessed taxes sales  use and value added taxes collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis excluded from net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
the government assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency 
inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on the average cost method 
our inventory cost also includes estimated buying and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  buying and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of buying and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we changed the method of determining cost under the lower of cost or market inventory valuation method used for our k g brand representing approximately of our inventory from the retail inventory method to the average cost method 
we believe the average cost method is preferable over the retail inventory method because it results in greater precision in the determination of cost of sales and inventories 
additionally  this change resulted in a consistent inventory valuation method for all of our inventories 
we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle retrospectively as of february  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as of february  was an increase in inventory of million  a decrease in deferred tax assets of million and a net increase in retained earnings of million 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives  are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of which there are identifiable cash flows  which is generally at a store level 
assets are reviewed using factors including  but not limited to  the company s future operating plans and projected cash flows 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly related to the assets  compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows of the assets does not exceed the carrying value of the assets  full or partial impairment may exist 
if the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined using an income approach  which requires discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  costs and useful lives of assets 
significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset 
changes to our key assumptions related to future performance  market conditions and other economic factors can significantly affect our impairment evaluation 
for example  unanticipated adverse market conditions can cause individual stores to become unprofitable and can result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores 
during fiscal  we recognized retail segment pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores and k g stores 
during fiscal  we recognized retail segment pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores  four k g stores and three men s wearhouse stores 
during fiscal  we recognized retail segment pretax non cash asset impairment charges of million related to store assets for men s wearhouse and tux stores and two k g stores 

table of contents the pretax asset impairment charges related to the store assets for the men s wearhouse and tux stores were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal and resulted mainly from a consumer driven shifting of rental revenues from the rental stores to our men s wearhouse stores located in close proximity one mile or less 
the pretax asset impairment charges for the k g stores of million in and million in were the result primarily of sales declines that started in and continued through fiscal caused mainly by the downturn experienced by the us economy 
in fiscal  we recognized pretax asset impairment charges of million for two k g stores that are still in operation 
we also recognized pretax asset impairment charges in fiscal of million for three men s wearhouse stores  one of which is still in operation at the end of fiscal no asset impairment charges were recognized for any men s wearhouse stores in fiscal or changes to our key assumptions related to future performance  market conditions and other economic factors could result in future impairment charges for stores or other long lived assets where the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values 
trademarks  tradenames  customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives of three to years using the straight line method and are periodically evaluated for impairment as discussed in the impairment of long lived assets section above 
identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life  including goodwill  are not amortized but are evaluated annually as of our fiscal year end for impairment 
a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 
such events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated changes in the competitive environment  decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 
goodwill  which totaled million at january   represents the excess cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in prior business combinations 
for purposes of our goodwill impairment evaluation  the reporting units are our operating brands identified in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands 
the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed in two steps 
the first step is intended to determine if potential impairment exists and is performed by comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired  and we must complete the second step of the testing to determine the amount of any impairment 
the second step requires an allocation of the reporting unit s first step estimated fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts allocated to the individual assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
in our step one process  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combined income and market comparable approach 
our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions 
the market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit 
we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

table of contents management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process 
the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions 
critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in revenue  gross margin and expense 
the cash flows are based on the company s most recent business operating plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our impairment evaluation are reasonable  however  variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants 
given current economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows for our reporting units ranged from to for the analysis 
selection of comparable companies within the industry 
for purposes of the market comparable approach  valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the reporting units being analyzed and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the reporting unit 
while the market price multiple is not an assumption  a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation 
the determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment 
earnings multiples of to were used for the analysis for our operating brands including men s wearhouse  k g  moores  mw cleaners and our uk based operations 
a revenue multiple of was used for the analysis for our twin hill operating brand 
as discussed above  the fair values of reporting units in were determined using a combined income and market comparable approach 
we believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing 
however  we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so 
the fair value derived from the weighting of these two methods provided appropriate valuations that  in aggregate  reasonably reconciled to our market capitalization  taking into account observable control premiums 
therefore  we used the valuations in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment and determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
the goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the reporting units 
actual values may differ significantly from these judgments  particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units 
sustained declines in the company s market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill impairment 
such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would  in turn  negatively impact the company s results of operations  however  any such goodwill impairments would be non cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our current debt covenants 
no goodwill impairment was identified in fiscal  or tuxedo rental product the cost of our tuxedo rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented  which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product 
lost  damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales 
tuxedo rental product is amortized to expense generally over a two to three year period 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience and information obtained from tuxedo 
table of contents rental industry sources  as to the number of times each unit can be rented 
if the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates  it could materially affect the amount of tuxedo rental product amortization included in cost of sales 
self insurance we self insure significant portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are established for temporary differences between financial and tax reporting bases and are subsequently adjusted to reflect changes in enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
the deferred tax assets are reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those tax benefits is uncertain 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since  in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
interest and or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our uncertain tax positions 
we have established accruals for uncertain tax positions using our best judgment and adjust these accruals  as warranted  due to changing facts and circumstances 
a change in our uncertain tax positions  in any given period  could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for that period 
operating leases our operating leases primarily relate to stores and generally contain rent escalation clauses  rent holidays  contingent rent provisions and occasionally leasehold incentives 
we recognize rent expense for operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which is generally five to ten years based on the initial lease term plus first renewal option periods that are reasonably assured 
rent expense for stores is included in cost of sales as a part of occupancy cost and other rent is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the lease terms commence when we take possession with the right to control use of the leased premises and  for stores  is generally days prior to the date rent payments begin 
rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period are recognized as rental expense 
deferred rent that results from recognition of rent on a straight line basis is included in other liabilities 
landlord incentives received for reimbursement of leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
contingent rentals are generally based on percentages of sales and are recognized as store rent expense as they accrue 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated guidance regarding testing goodwill for impairment 
the updated guidance will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
under this amendment  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the amended guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this update will only impact our testing of goodwill for impairment and will have no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this updated guidance on our goodwill impairment testing process 
in june  the fasb issued updated guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the updated guidance allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued a deferral of the effective date for amendments of the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this defers only the changes that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
these amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this update will only impact the presentation of comprehensive income in our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb updated the guidance regarding certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the updated guidance amends us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to create more commonality with international financial reporting standards ifrs by changing some of the wording used to describe requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial information and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  our risk management policy is to hedge a significant portion of forecasted merchandise purchases for our direct sourcing programs that bear foreign exchange risk using foreign exchange forward contracts 
the company has not elected to apply hedge accounting to these transactions denominated in a foreign currency 
at january   we had contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase euros for an aggregate notional amount of us million maturing at various dates through june  nine contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase usd for an aggregate notional amount of cad million maturing at various dates through june and contracts maturing in varying increments to purchase usd for an aggregate notional amount of gbp million maturing at various dates through may for the fiscal year ended january   we recognized a net pre tax loss of million in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of earnings for our derivative financial instruments not designated as hedging instruments

no amounts were recognized in our results of operations during fiscal a hypothetical increase in applicable january  forward rates could decrease the fair value of the derivative financial instruments by million  whereas a hypothetical decrease in applicable january  forward rates could increase the fair value of the derivative contracts by million 
however  it should be noted that any change in the value of these contracts  whether real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged item 
dimensions and alexandra  our uk based operations  sell their products and conduct their business primarily in gbp but purchase most of their merchandise in transactions paid in us dollars 
the exchange rate between the gbp and us dollar has fluctuated over the last ten years 
a decline in the value of the gbp as compared to the us dollar will adversely impact our uk operating results as the cost of merchandise purchases will increase and the revenues and earnings of our uk operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our uk net assets in us dollars may decline 
dimensions and alexandra utilize foreign currency hedging contracts as discussed above to limit exposure to changes in us dollar gbp exchange rates 
moores conducts its business in cad 
the exchange rate between cad and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the cad against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
moores utilizes foreign currency hedging contracts as discussed above to limit exposure to changes in us dollar cad exchange rates
