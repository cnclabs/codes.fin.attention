item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing revenues  operating earnings and depreciation are as follows in thousands revenues crude oil natural gas refined products total operating earnings loss crude oil natural gas refined products total depreciation crude oil natural gas refined products total supplemental volume and price information is field level purchases per day crude oil barrels natural gas mmbtu s average purchase price crude oil per barrel natural gas per mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points 
comparison to crude oil revenues grew by percent in due to both volume and price increases 
average crude oil prices increased percent and crude oil lease level volumes improved by percent as shown in the table above 
the field level purchase volume growth was a result of new production from expanded drilling activity in the eagle ford trend of south texas 
crude oil operating earnings increased significantly in due to widening unit gross margins 
this result stems from south texas sourced crude oil selling at a discount to world oil prices due to its relative abundance in relation to the infrastructure available to deliver such oil to market 
in addition  during the second quarter of  the company completed construction of a barge terminal facility at the port of victoria  texas 
this facility allows the company to increase margins on its gathered production in the area by barging it to more advantageous markets 
increasing crude oil prices also boosted operating earnings during the average acquisition price of crude oil moved from per barrel at the beginning of the year to per barrel for december  resulting in inventory liquidation gains totaling  similarly  during  crude oil prices rose from the per barrel range in january to the per barrel range by december producing a  inventory liquidation gain 
as of december   the company held  barrels of crude oil inventory at an average price of per barrel 
diesel fuel expense which tends to fluctuate in tandem with crude oil prices also has a significant impact on operating earnings 
a relatively low level of diesel fuel costs during  served to improve comparative operating earnings for such year relative to diesel fuel cost were elevated in due to increased prices and an approximate unit expansion of the truck fleet engaged to handle added volumes 
the impact on crude oil operating earnings from inventory liquidation gains and diesel fuel cost is summarized as follows in thousands as reported operating earnings inventory liquidation gains diesel fuel expense natural gas sales are reported net of underlying natural gas purchase costs and thus reflect gross margin 
as shown above  gross margins were reduced during as average field level purchase volumes were off percent for the period 
current volumes declined because the company s natural gas suppliers do not operate in the shale areas and therefore curtailed drilling activity due to declining natural gas prices 
the company s primary source of natural gas supply is the non shale areas of texas  louisiana and the gulf of mexico 
in addition to volume declines  development of the nation s natural gas infrastructure including more diverse areas of production and expanded pipeline and storage capacity have served to reduce purchase opportunities and per unit margins 
operating earnings for the refined products segment continued to underperform following the downturn in the domestic economy which began during the third quarter of due to customer slow payment patterns  refined product operating earnings were additionally impacted in and when the bad debt provision was increased by approximately  and  respectively 
as a result of its recent market performance  in february the company sold substantially all contracts  equipment and inventories associated with its refined products segment and is completing an orderly wind down of this business 
cash proceeds from the sale totaled million plus the fair market value of refined product inventories and the company will record a gain of approximately million during the first quarter of historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
see discussion under item a risk factors 
transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
revenues and operating results improved for the transportation segment in both and due to increased customer demand 
the company also benefitted in from million in gains from the sale of used equipment following the purchase of new truck replacements 
the company s customers predominately consist of the domestic petrochemical industry and demand for such products has substantially recovered from the slow down occurring in serving to improve customer demand was a recovering united states economy  relatively low natural gas prices and improved export demand for petrochemicals 
in addition  during the previous economic downturn  the trucking industry reduced capacity by retiring older units without replacement 
with demand improvement  industry capacity has been strained allowing rate increases and improved overall profitability 
as transportation revenues increase or decrease  operating earnings will typically increase or decrease at an accelerated rate 
this trend exists because the fixed cost components of the company s operation do not vary with changing revenues 
as currently configured  operating earnings project at break even levels when annual revenues average approximately million 
above that level  operating earnings will grow and below that level losses result 
transportation segment depreciation increased for and relative to as older fully depreciated tractor units were replaced with new model year vehicles with a portion of the increase offset by certain in service trailers becoming fully depreciated during the periods 
during the company replaced older model tractor units and added new units to the fleet 
tractor replacement for and totaled units and units  respectively 
in addition trailers were added to the fleet during oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts for revenues  operating earnings and depreciation and depletion were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings loss depreciation and depletion producing property impairments represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
excludes gains from property sales the revenue improvement for the oil and gas segment during and is primarily attributable to crude oil and natural gas volumes increases as shown in the table below 
volumes improved with the results of recent drilling efforts 
operating earnings declined due to increased charges for depreciation  depletion and producing property impairments as well as increased exploration and impairment expenses as shown in the second table below 
depreciation and depletion expense increased in both and with increased volumes and as the depreciable property basis grew from capital expenditures

the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows east texas project in  the company joined with its partners in acquiring exploration acreage in nacogdoches and shelby counties  texas 
this was subsequently expanded to include acreage in angelina county  due south of nacogdoches county 
this investment holds potential in the haynesville bossier shale formations 
subsequent drilling determined that a sweet spot existed 
a total of wells were drilled to date with wells on production and wells currently in the completion stage 
the company s interest in this project varies from two percent to five percent with an average percent ownership in the properties and wells 
production is dry gas and due to current low prices  only wells are planned for to secure the company s acreage position 
approximately  gross acres are now held by production with  additional acres under option to earn through drilling 
in field development of this property will resume when justified by higher natural gas prices 
west texas project in  the company participated with an approximate two percent working interest in the acquisition of approximately  acres located in irion and crockett counties  texas for the purpose of developing the wolfcamp shale 
an aggressive horizontal drilling program is now underway 
a total of wells have been drilled with wells on production and wells being completed 
drilling is expected to accelerate in with wells scheduled to spud 
production from the wolfcamp in this area is oil rich  with large amounts of gas and natural gas liquids 
south texas project this project includes two approved prospects in the eagle ford trend of south texas with approximately  acres currently under lease 
the goal of this investment is to extend the productive area of the eagle ford trend north in fayette and lavaca counties  texas 
the first core well has been drilled and indications are positive with petrochemical data showing the project is on the gas condensate window 
drilling plans initially call for the first horizontal test well to spud during the second quarter of the company holds a five percent working interest in this project 
oil and gas property sales in january  the company completed the sale of its interest in certain producing oil and gas properties located in the on shore gulf coast region of texas 
proceeds from the sale totaled million and the pre tax gain from this transaction totaled  total proved reserves sold were approximately  barrels of crude oil and  mcf of natural gas 
sales negotiations were conducted by the third party operator of the properties on behalf of all working interest owners and the transaction was completed with a separate third party investment entity 
the company s proportionate interest in the transaction was approximately percent and the company elected to participate in the sale due to attractive pricing 
also during the first quarter of  the company sold a portion of its interest in certain non producing oil and gas properties located in west texas 
total proceeds from the sale were  and the company recorded a  gain from this transaction 
proceeds from the sales were used for general working capital purposes and the company is continuing with oil and gas exploration operations in the vicinity of the properties sold 
in october  the company sold an interest in certain non producing properties for  in proceeds and gain 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses were consistent during the three year review period ending december  except during such costs were elevated due to employee bonuses 
interest income declined for  and as interest rates on overnight deposits declined to near zero following the significant turmoil that occurred in the financial markets during the fall of the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
outlook the short term outlook presumes continued volume and margin strength within the crude oil marketing operation 
industry competitors and company suppliers are aware of the present opportunity  however  and are actively seeking to capture such advantage and unit margins have begun to shrink 
over the course of the mid term time horizon months from current date management anticipates crude oil marketing margins will return to their approximate historical levels 
transportation results slowed in late but generally look to be stable for within the oil and gas segment  declining natural gas prices will  in all likelihood  offset volume increases from the new wells coming on line in however  absent further declines in commodity prices  the recurrence of property impairment charges is unlikely in in contrast  should recent escalation in diesel fuel costs continue  marketing and transportation earnings could be adversely affected to some extent 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level exclusive of inventory valuation gains or losses 
maintain transportation operating earnings at the million level excluding gains from the sale of used equipment 
return oil and gas operating earnings to the million level and replace production with current reserve additions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity primarily derives from net cash provided from operating activities  which was   and  for each of  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december   and such balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day to day cash needs 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  totaled  as of december  capital expenditures during included  for marketing and transportation equipment additions  primarily consisting of truck tractors  and  in property additions associated with oil and gas exploration and production activities 
for  the company anticipates expending an additional approximately million on oil and gas development and exploration projects 
in addition  approximately million will be expended during for the purchase of truck tractors for the transportation segment and approximately million will be expended for the purchase of truck tractors and trailers for the marketing segment with funding for such purchase from available cash flow 
these units will serve to replace older units and to increase the marketing fleet 
funding for these projects will be from operating cash flow and available working capital 
within certain constraints  the proposed projects can be delayed or cancelled should funding become unavailable 
from time to time  the company may make cash prepayments to certain suppliers of crude oil and natural gas for the company s marketing operations 
such prepayments totaled  as of december  and such amounts will be recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the company 
the company also requires certain counterparties to post cash collateral with the company in order to support their purchase from the company 
such cash collateral held by the company totaled  as of december  the company also maintains a stand by letter of credit facility with wells fargo bank to provide for the issuance of up to million in stand by letters of credit to the company s suppliers of crude oil and natural gas see note to financial statements 
the issuance of stand by letters of credit enables the company to avoid posting cash collateral when procuring crude oil and natural gas supply 
as of december   letters of credit outstanding totaled million 
management believes current cash balances  together with expected cash generated from future operations  and the ease of financing truck and trailer additions through leasing arrangements should the need arise will be sufficient to meet short term and long term liquidity needs 
the company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its oil and natural gas exploration  marketing and transportation businesses  which comprise substantially all of the company s investing cash outflows for each of the periods in this filing 
the company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs 
except for an approximate million commitment for transportation equipment  operating leases and storage tank terminal arrangements and office lease space  the company s future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract 
historically  the company pays an annual dividend in the fourth quarter of each year  and the company paid a 
per common share dividend or  to shareholders of record as of december  the most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations see item a 
risk factors in this annual report of form k 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements primarily with independent truck owner operators in order to provide truck tractor equipment for the company s fleet 
any commitments with independent truck owner operators are on a month to month basis 
in addition  the company has entered into certain lease and terminal access contracts in order to provide tank storage and dock access for its crude oil marketing business 
such contracts require certain minimum monthly payments for the term of the contracts 
all operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
as of december   rental commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases and terminal arrangements for the next five years are payable as follows      and  thereafter 
contractual cash obligations the company has no capital lease obligations 
the company has entered into certain operating lease arrangements and terminal access agreements for tankage  truck tractors  trailers and office space 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual cash obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total lease payments in addition to its lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are worker s compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during each of  and  insurance costs were consistent with activity and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during subject to market conditions 
since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there have been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value and such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for  and the company elects  cash flow hedge accounting 
the company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during  and the company utilizes a market approach to valuing its commodity contracts 
on a contract by contract  forward month by forward month basis  the company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts 
such contracts typically have durations that are less than months 
as of december   all of the company s market value measurements were based on either quoted prices in active markets level inputs or from inputs based on observable market data level inputs 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s fair value contracts give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the company s risk management policies 
such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management s objectives  strategies and current market conditions 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas production  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty and other factors impact the market price for oil and natural gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and natural gas properties 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimate the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the appropriate accounting literature guidelines 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced daily or monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
see discussion under revenue recognition policy in note of the consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and natural gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 oil and gas reserve estimations and disclosures asu no 

this update aligns the current oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of the extractive industries oil and gas topic of the asc asc topic with the changes required by the sec final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  as discussed above 
asu no 
expands the disclosures required for equity method investments  revises the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include nontraditional resources in reserves unless not intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas  amends the definition of proved oil and gas reserves to require month average pricing in estimating reserves  amends and adds definitions in the master glossary that is used in estimating proved oil and gas quantities and provides guidance on geographic area with respect to disclosure of information about significant reserves 
asu no 
must be applied prospectively as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate 
the company adopted asu no 
effective december  in may  the fasb issued asu  which further amends the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the accounting standards codification 
among other provisions  asu expands and modifies certain principles and requirements for measuring fair value and disclosing fair value measurement information 
asu is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  but may result in additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
in december  the fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu this update requires additional disclosures about an entity s right of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial and derivative instruments 
the asu requires a tabular presentation that reflects the gross  net and setoff amounts associated with such assets and liabilities among other requirements 
the expanded disclosure requirements are effective for the annual reporting periods beginning on january  the adoption of asu is not expected to result in significant additional disclosures 
management believes the impact of other recently issued standards and updates  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had no long term debt outstanding at december  and a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in order to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to eighteen month term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected in the balance sheet as fair value assets and liabilities and any revaluation is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas sales have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
crude oil prices ranged from a monthly average low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  for the comparative years ended december  and  respectively
