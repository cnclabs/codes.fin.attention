item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary for the year ended december  our operating loss of  was comparable to the  operating loss we reported for our operating loss was primarily attributable to a decline in sales and a reduction in our gross margins  which was largely offset by corresponding reductions in operating expenses 
total sales for decreased to approximately million compared with approximately million for the prior year  reflecting lower sales of p digital products to government and public safety customers while sales of analog products remained flat 
gross margins as a percentage of sales in were compared with for the prior year 
the decline in gross margins is primarily attributed to higher than normal product costs during the first half of the year related to the early production of some of our new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased approximately million to approximately million compared with last year 
this decrease was primarily from reductions in engineering expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and to a lesser extent  general and administrative expenses 
these reductions were implemented in response to sluggish sales 
we reported a pretax loss for of  compared with a pretax loss of  last year 
for  we recognized an income tax benefit of  compared with income tax expense of  last year 
our income tax benefit and expense are largely non cash  relating to deferred items including net operating loss carryforwards 
the net loss for was  per basic and diluted share  compared with approximately  per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
as of december   working capital totaled approximately million  of which million was comprised of cash and trade receivables 
this compares with working capital totaling approximately million at year end  which included million of cash and trade receivables 
during we repaid all borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
consequently  there were no borrowings outstanding as of december   compared with borrowings of million as of year end we experience seasonality in our quarterly results in part due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year end budgets and appropriations 
we also experience seasonality in our quarterly results in part due to our concentration of sales to federal and state agencies that participate in fire suppression efforts  which are typically the greatest during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened 
in some years  these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year 
such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial condition 
results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percent of sales percent of sales for years ended december sales cost of products gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses net interest expense income loss income before income tax expense benefit income tax benefit expense net loss income fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in decreased million to approximately million compared with approximately million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in decreased approximately million to approximately million  compared with approximately million for the decrease in total sales and p digital sales compared with the prior year was attributed primarily to federal government agencies 
these agencies  including our longstanding legacy customers  faced budget and funding constraints during the year 
the enactment of a federal budget was delayed until april once enacted  the budget did not provide adequate funding for many land mobile radio requirements 
consequently  agencies had to scale down or defer fulfilling their requirements 
while present conditions remain uncertain  we are encouraged by an increasing pipeline of sales opportunities  including those with state and local governments  and public safety agencies 
we believe our expanded line of products and technology increase our addressable market and  accordingly  improve our prospects to convert these opportunities into sales 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in product mix  manufacturing volume and pricing are the primary factors that impact product costs and the resulting gross margins 
for  our cost of products and gross margins reflected reduced sales and higher material and labor costs for the early production of new products 
these factors abated during the second half of the year 
production runs later in the year benefited from refinements in our manufacturing processes  yielding lower material costs and improved labor efficiencies 
also  sales increased in the second half of the year compared with the first half resulting in increased manufacturing volumes  and better utilization and absorption of our base of manufacturing support expenses 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and to reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
leveraging increased sales volumes and p product sales combined with continuing improvements in the production of new products  we believe  should favorably impact our costs and efficiencies 
we anticipate that product cost and competitive pricing pressures will continue in the future  however  the extent of their impact on gross margins is uncertain 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
for  sg a expenses decreased approximately million to approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses for decreased approximately  compared with the prior year 
the decrease was the result of expense reductions that commenced in the second quarter and continued for the remainder of the year  as some product development initiatives were completed 
the expense reductions were partially offset by amortization of additional capitalized software that commenced during the fourth quarter when we released our new trunking digital radio and continued in marketing and selling expenses for decreased by approximately  compared with last year 
these decreases relate primarily to expense and commission reductions implemented during the second quarter and maintained for the remainder of the year 
although expenses have been reduced  we intend to prioritize and support critical initiatives for sales growth 
general and administrative expenses for decreased by approximately  compared with last year 
these expense reductions are primarily the result of reductions in headquarters and public company expenses  including non cash share based employee compensation expenses 
operating loss we reported an operating loss of  for  compared with an operating loss of  last year 
the operating loss for was primarily due to sluggish sales and increases in cost of products during the first half of the year 
these factors were partially offset by operating expense reductions implemented during the second quarter and maintained for the remainder of the year 
interest expense  net for  net interest expense totaled  compared with  for the prior year 
the expense increase is due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we incur interest expense on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and earn interest income on our cash balances 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december   compared with million outstanding as of year end the interest rate on such revolving credit facility as of december  was per annum 
this rate is variable based on the prime rate plus basis points 
income tax expense we recorded an income tax benefit of  for compared with income tax expense of  last year 
our income tax expense is largely non cash as a result of the deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which was materially unchanged from the previous the year 
these assets are primarily composed of net operating loss carry forwards nols  which are available to offset federal and state taxable income 
these nols totaled approximately million for federal and approximately million for state purposes as of december   with expirations starting in through during  we utilized approximately million of our nols 
in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our nols prior to their expiration 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the state deferred tax assets 
the recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to not realize a portion of the benefit of our state deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately  for the portion of benefit of state deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized 
we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recognized as of december accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in decreased million to approximately million compared with million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in increased million to approximately million  compared with million for the decrease in total sales compared with the prior year was attributed primarily to a decline in orders from agencies of the dod as well as some other federal and state agencies 
the overall decrease in total sales was partially offset by increased sales with legacy customers such as the usfs and doi purchasing our d series p digital radios 
during  we added several products to our kng line of p digital radios 
most important was the fourth quarter launch of our p digital trunked products  the first such products in relm s history 
this enabled us to address a significant portion of the land mobile radio market that previously was beyond the scope of our product line 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in our cost of products and gross margins are primarily related to product mix  manufacturing volumes and pricing 
compared with last year  our gross margins for the year reflected reduced sales and the impact of additional manufacturing costs  some of which relate to the start of new product production 
competitive pricing considerations and a change in the mix of products sold were also contributing factors 
we continued to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consisted of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
for  sg a expenses increased approximately million to approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses in increased by million compared with last year 
this increase was largely the result of efforts to advance the completion and launch of our p trunking capability  as well as other p radios and features in our expanding kng product line 
marketing and selling expenses in increased by approximately  compared with last year 
during the year we increased sales staffing and incurred additional sales and marketing expenses focused on raising the profile of our new kng product line and capabilities  and penetrating new markets and customers 
general and administrative expenses in increased by approximately  compared with last year primarily due to non cash share based employee compensation expense 
operating loss income we reported an operating loss of approximately  for  compared with operating income of approximately million last year 
during  total sales decreased million  or  from the previous year and there were additional manufacturing costs  some of which were associated with production of new products 
also  the mix of product sales was less favorable 
interest expense  net for  we incurred approximately  in net interest expense compared with approximately  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
we had million in borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december   compared with no borrowings outstanding as of the end of the prior year 
the interest rate on such revolving credit facility as of december  was per annum 
this rate is variable based on the prime rate plus basis points

changing prices changing prices for the years ended december   and did not have a material impact on our operations 
during  in some instances  product unit prices were reduced to convert sales opportunities into sales  which reduced gross margins 
the extent of competitive pricing pressure in the future and its impact is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately  compared with net cash used in operating activities of approximately million last year 
cash used in operating activities was primarily related to a net loss combined with payments of trade payables and increased inventories and trade receivables 
these uses were largely offset by depreciation  amortization and deferred revenue from extended warranties 
net inventories increased during by approximately  compared with million for last year as we controlled material purchases due to sluggish sales 
in  inventory increased significantly in support of the broader line of new products and anticipated demand 
we have and are continuing to actively manage our purchases to align inventory with anticipated business levels 
for  accounts payable decreased by approximately million as a result of payments to suppliers 
for  accounts payable increased by approximately million primarily due to material purchases 
accounts receivable increased by approximately  during compared with an increase of approximately  for the prior year 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately million for  compared with approximately  for the prior year  reflecting the additional amortization of capitalized software relating to our new products that commenced in the fourth quarter cash used in investing activities for totaled  compared with approximately million last year 
cash used in investing activities for was primarily to fund the purchase of test equipment and tooling for manufacturing and engineering applications 
for the prior year  cash used in investing activities was to fund digital software development and the acquisition of assets pertaining to the development of our new digital products 
we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded through our existing cash balance and operating cash flow 
cash used in financing activities for totaled million representing repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in  cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million representing borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility   in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and  in tax benefits from the exercise and sale of employees stock options 
we have a secured revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank svb with maximum borrowing availability of million subject to the borrowing base and a maturity date of december  our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  principally accounts receivable and inventory 
the loan and security agreement  as amended  governing this revolving credit facility contains customary borrowing terms and conditions  including the accuracy of representations and warranties  compliance with financial maintenance and restrictive covenants and the absence of events of default 
for a description of such borrowing terms and conditions  reference is made to note debt of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
as of december  and the date of this report  we were in compliance with all covenants under the loan and security agreement  as amended 
as of december  and the date of this report  there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
as of december  and the date of this report  approximately million and million  respectively  was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
our cash balance at december  was approximately million 
we believe these funds combined with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term  the current financial and economic conditions could limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital  if needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
we also face other risks that could impact our business  liquidity and financial condition 
for a description of these risks  see item a 
risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report 
the following table sets forth the company s future contractual obligations for the next five years and in the aggregate as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations revolving credit facility total for a description of our revolving credit facility and our operating leases  reference is made to notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that impacted the years ended december   and  or which are expected to impact future periods  which were not previously disclosed in prior periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for discussion our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of relm 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  software development and income taxes  involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on relm s operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped by the company or delivered to the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the federal government are recognized when the products are delivered 
for extended warranties  sales revenue associated with the warranty is deferred at the time of sale and later recognized on a straight line basis over the extended warranty period 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with asc topic revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december   as compared with  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales during past years 
accordingly  we have maintained a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability 
currently  our general allowance on trade receivables is approximately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
excess and obsolete inventory the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year and establish a reserve based upon several factors  including  but not limited to  business forecasts  inventory quantities and historic usage profile 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect an accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price less cost  if any  to sell 
software development we account for the costs of software within its products in accordance with asc topic costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  under which certain software costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
we determine technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a detailed program design as specified by topic upon the general release of the product to customers  development costs for that product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years  based on current and future revenue of the product 
net capitalized software costs totaled approximately million as of december   as compared with approximately million as of december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic  income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future
