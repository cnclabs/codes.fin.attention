critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following are considered our most critical accounting policies that  under different conditions or using different assumption or estimates  could show materially different results on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc  revenue recognition in financial statements  when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred when risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders and contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue on shipments to distributors and resellers is recognized on delivery 
generally  we do not grant a right of return 
however  certain distributors are allowed  in the sixth month after the initial stock purchase  to rotate stock that has not been sold for other products 
this stock rotation may be repeated every six months thereafter for fifteen to eighteen months  based on a fixed percentage at no more than the distributor s purchases during the previous six months 
revenues subject to stock rotation rights are deferred until the products are sold to the end customer or until the rotation rights expire 
service revenues are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the service agreement 
service revenues are immaterial in proportion to the company s revenues 
inventory obsolescence accruals we periodically assess our inventory valuation by reviewing revenue forecasts and technological obsolescence 
we write down the value of obsolete or unmarketable inventory to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during and  we recorded inventory write offs of  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the us and europe 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and currently require no collateral from our customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses is maintained in anticipation of the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was  and  respectively 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations as a result of bankruptcy or the deterioration of the customer s operating results or financial position  for example  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  and if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may decrease a portion of such allowance in future periods based on actual collection experience 
other accrued liabilities our accrued liabilities are based on a variety of factors including past experience and  in many cases  require estimates 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
marketable securities the company classifies its investment in telkoor s shares as available for sale securities in accordance with asc originally issued as sfas  investment in debt and equity securities 
marketable securities classified as available for sale securities are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses are reported in a separate component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
when evaluating the investment for other than temporary impairment  the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto  and the company s intent to sell  or whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  the investment before recovery of the investment s amortized cost basis 
based on the factors considered by the company  the company concluded that unrealized losses on its available for sale securities were not other than temporary 
as such  the company did not recognize any impairment charges on outstanding securities 
equity based compensation expense we account for equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires the exercise of judgment  including the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical pre vesting forfeitures 
if actual results differ from these estimates  equity based compensation expense  and therefore our results of operations  could be impacted 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted under asc formerly sfas no 
revised  share based payment asc  using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses the following assumption expected volatility is based on historical volatility  which is representative of future volatility over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of options granted was determined based on the simplified method  which is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of u 
s treasury bonds with equivalent terms 
the dividend yield is based on the company s historical and future expectation of dividends payouts 
the company has not paid cash dividends historically and has no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  this compares with cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is due mainly to the completion of the purchase of an investment in telkoor and increase in inventory 
the increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in inventories  offset partially by a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  the net usage of cash from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in inventories  a decrease in related parties trade payables and accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  the net usage of cash from investing activities is due to the investment of telkoor for million and purchase of capital equipment for  net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   and was due to the exercise of employee options 
in september   our wholly owned subsidiary  dpl  entered into a new fifteen year lease for its  square foot facility in salisbury  united kingdom  where it designs  develops  manufactures  markets and distributes commercial and military power products for the european market 
sales and service support staff for its european network of distributors are located within the building together with other functions  such as engineering and administration 
dpl s rent expense is approximately  per month  and dpl has the option to cancel the lease after ten years 
we believe we have adequate resources at this time to continue our operational and promotional efforts to increase sales and support our current operation 
however  if we do not increase our sales  we may have to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity  which may dilute shareholders equity
