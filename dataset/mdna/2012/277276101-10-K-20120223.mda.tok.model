item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview eastgroup s goal is to maximize shareholder value by being a leading provider in its markets of functional  flexible and quality business distribution space for location sensitive tenants primarily in the  to  square foot range 
the company acquires  develops and operates distribution facilities  the majority of which are clustered around major transportation features in supply constrained submarkets in major sunbelt regions 
the company s core markets are in the states of florida  texas  arizona  california and north carolina 
the operations of the company improved during compared to occupancy has stabilized and is currently improving  but the company still experiences decreases in rental rates 
the company is able to obtain financing at attractive rates  but lenders underwriting standards have become stricter 
the company believes its current operating cash flow and lines of credit provide the capacity to fund the operations of the company for the company also believes it can issue common and or preferred equity and obtain mortgage financing from insurance companies and financial institutions as evidenced by the closing of a million  non recourse first mortgage loan in may  the closing of a million  non recourse first mortgage loan in january  the closing of a million unsecured term loan in december  and the continuous common equity offering program  which provided net proceeds to the company of million during  as described in liquidity and capital resources 
the company s primary revenue is rental income  as such  eastgroup s greatest challenge is leasing space 
during  leases expired on  square feet of eastgroup s total square footage of  and the company was successful in renewing or re leasing of the expiring square feet 
in addition  eastgroup leased  square feet of other vacant space during the year 
during  average rental rates on new and renewal leases decreased by 
property net operating income pnoi from same properties increased for compared to eastgroup s total leased percentage was at december  compared to at december  leases scheduled to expire in were of the portfolio on a square foot basis at december  as of february   leases scheduled to expire in were of the portfolio on a square foot basis 
the company generates new sources of leasing revenue through its acquisition and development programs 
during  eastgroup purchased five warehouse distribution complexes  square feet and acres of development land for a total of million 
the operating properties are located in tampa  square feet  charlotte  square feet  san antonio  square feet and tempe  arizona  square feet 
the development land is located adjacent to the company s existing world houston international business center acres and near an existing eastgroup property in chandler  arizona acres 
eastgroup continues to see targeted development as a contributor to the company s long term growth 
the company mitigates risks associated with development through a board approved maximum level of land held for development and by adjusting development start dates according to leasing activity 
during  the company began construction of eight development projects containing  square feet in houston  san antonio and orlando 
also in  eastgroup transferred one property  square feet in san antonio from its development program to real estate properties with costs of million at the date of transfer 
as of december   eastgroup s development program consisted of nine buildings  square feet located in houston  san antonio and orlando 
the projected total cost for the development projects  which were collectively leased as of february   is million  of which million remained to be invested as of december  during  the company initially funded its acquisition and development programs through its million lines of credit as discussed in liquidity and capital resources 
as market conditions permit  eastgroup issues equity  including preferred equity  and or employs fixed rate debt to replace short term bank borrowings 
eastgroup has one reportable segment industrial properties 
these properties are primarily located in major sunbelt regions of the united states  have similar economic characteristics and also meet the other criteria that permit the properties to be aggregated into one reportable segment 
the company s chief decision makers use two primary measures of operating results in making decisions property net operating income pnoi  defined as income from real estate operations less property operating expenses before interest expense and depreciation and amortization  and funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ffo  defined as net income loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable real estate property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company calculates ffo based on the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition 
pnoi is a supplemental industry reporting measurement used to evaluate the performance of the company s real estate investments 
the company believes the exclusion of depreciation and amortization in the industry s calculation of pnoi provides a supplemental indicator of the properties performance since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
pnoi as calculated by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled but differently calculated measures for other real estate investment trusts reits 
the major factors influencing pnoi are occupancy levels  acquisitions and sales  development properties that achieve stabilized operations  rental rate increases or decreases  and the recoverability of operating expenses 
the company s success depends largely upon its ability to lease space and to recover from tenants the operating costs associated with those leases 
pnoi is comprised of income from real estate operations  less expenses from real estate operations 
pnoi was calculated as follows for the three fiscal years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands income from real estate operations expenses from real estate operations property net operating income income from real estate operations is comprised of rental income  expense reimbursement pass through income and other real estate income including lease termination fees 
expenses from real estate operations is comprised of property taxes  insurance  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  management fees  other operating costs and bad debt expense 
generally  the company s most significant operating expenses are property taxes and insurance 
tenant leases may be net leases in which the total operating expenses are recoverable  modified gross leases in which some of the operating expenses are recoverable  or gross leases in which no expenses are recoverable gross leases represent only a small portion of the company s total leases 
increases in property operating expenses are fully recoverable under net leases and recoverable to a high degree under modified gross leases 
modified gross leases often include base year amounts and expense increases over these amounts are recoverable 
the company s exposure to property operating expenses is primarily due to vacancies and leases for occupied space that limit the amount of expenses that can be recovered 
the following table presents reconciliations of net income to pnoi for the three fiscal years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands net income equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment interest income other income gain on sales of non operating real estate income loss from discontinued operations depreciation and amortization from continuing operations interest expense general and administrative expense acquisition costs other expense property net operating income the company believes ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of operating performance for equity reits 
the company believes that excluding depreciation and amortization in the calculation of ffo is appropriate since real estate values have historically increased or decreased based on market conditions 
ffo is not considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance  nor is it a measure of the company s liquidity or indicative of funds available to provide for the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
in addition  ffo  as reported by the company  may not be comparable to ffo by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
the company s key drivers affecting ffo are changes in pnoi as discussed above  interest rates  the amount of leverage the company employs and general and administrative expense 
the following table presents reconciliations of net income attributable to eastgroup properties  inc common stockholders to ffo attributable to common stockholders for the three fiscal years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income attributable to eastgroup properties  inc

for the year  ffo was per share compared with per share for  an increase of per share 
for the year ended december   pnoi increased by  or  compared to mainly due to increases in pnoi of  from same property operations   from newly developed properties  and  from and acquisitions 
same property net operating income change represents the pnoi increase or decrease for the same operating properties owned during the entire current period and prior year reporting period 
pnoi from same properties increased for the year ended december   compared to occupancy is the percentage of leased square footage for which the lease term has commenced compared to the total leasable square footage as of the close of the reporting period 
occupancy at december  was 
quarter end occupancy ranged from to over the period from december  to december  rental rate change represents the rental rate increase or decrease on new and renewal leases compared to the prior leases on the same space 
for the year  rental rate decreases on new and renewal leases of total square footage averaged 
for the year  termination fee income was  compared to  for bad debt expense was  for compared to  for critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management considers the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical to the reported operations of the company 
real estate properties the company allocates the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
factors considered by management in allocating the cost of the properties acquired include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
the allocation to tangible assets land  building and improvements is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models 
the purchase price is also allocated among the following categories of intangible assets the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases  and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above and below market leases are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship values based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
during the period in which a property is under development  costs associated with development ie  land  construction costs  interest expense  property taxes  and other direct and indirect costs associated with development are aggregated into the total capitalized costs of the property 
included in these costs are management s estimates for the portions of internal costs primarily personnel costs that are deemed directly or indirectly related to such development activities 
the company reviews its real estate investments for impairment of value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if any real estate investment is considered permanently impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
real estate assets to be sold are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
the evaluation of real estate investments involves many subjective assumptions dependent upon future economic events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
currently  the company s management knows of no impairment issues nor has it experienced any impairment issues in recent years 
eastgroup currently has the intent and ability to hold its real estate investments and to hold its land inventory for future development 
in the event of impairment  the property s basis would be reduced  and the impairment would be recognized as a current period charge on the consolidated statements of income 
valuation of receivables the company is subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  the company performs credit reviews and analyses on prospective tenants before significant leases are executed and on existing tenants before properties are acquired 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates outstanding receivables and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management specifically analyzes aged receivables  customer credit worthiness  historical bad debts and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate for its outstanding receivables for the periods presented 
in the event the allowance for doubtful accounts is insufficient for an account that is subsequently written off  additional bad debt expense would be recognized as a current period charge on the consolidated statements of income 
tax status eastgroup  a maryland corporation  has qualified as a real estate investment trust under sections of the internal revenue code and intends to continue to qualify as such 
to maintain its status as a reit  the company is required to distribute at least of its ordinary taxable income to its stockholders 
if the company has a capital gain  it has the option of i deferring recognition of the capital gain through a tax deferred exchange  ii declaring and paying a capital gain dividend on any recognized net capital gain resulting in no corporate level tax  or iii retaining and paying corporate income tax on its net long term capital gain  with the shareholders reporting their proportional share of the undistributed long term capital gain and receiving a credit or refund of their share of the tax paid by the company 
the company distributed all of its  and taxable income to its stockholders 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes was necessary

inflation and other economic considerations most of the company s leases include scheduled rent increases 
additionally  most of the company s leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including real estate taxes  insurance and common area maintenance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in the event inflation causes increases in the company s general and administrative expenses or the level of interest rates  such increased costs would not be passed through to tenants and could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
eastgroup s financial results are affected by general economic conditions in the markets in which the company s properties are located
