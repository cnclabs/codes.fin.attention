our actual results may differ materially from the results and business plans discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed under item a risk factors as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
our business activities the company is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the exploration for and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
at december   we have not yet achieved our planned principal operations from our oil and gas exploration activities which commenced on august  accordingly  our activities are considered to be those of a development stage enterprise 
the recoverability of the costs we have incurred to date is uncertain and dependent upon achieving significant commercial production and sale of hydrocarbons or sale of exploration assets  our ability to obtain sufficient financing to fulfill our obligations under the production sharing or other contracts we are a party to with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in india  israel and colombia and upon future profitable operations 
at present  our activities are being undertaken in four geological basins located offshore and onshore in india  one geological basin located offshore in israel and one geological basin located onshore in colombia where reserves of oil or natural gas are believed by our management to exist 
the exploration rights pursuant to pscs we have entered into with the government of india are located in the following areas the krishna godavari basin offshore and onshore in the state of andhra pradesh in south eastern india  the cambay basin onshore in the state of gujarat in western india  the deccan syneclise basin onshore in the state of maharashtra in west central india  and the bikaner nagaur basin onshore in the state of rajasthan in north western india 
the exploration rights pursuant to licenses we have been granted in israel are located in the levantine basin located off the coast of israel with the licenses varying in distances between and miles offshore 
we have entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with respect to two exploration blocks located in the putumayo basin onshore in southwest colombia 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december  we incurred a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss is mostly a result of recognizing impairment of oil and gas properties in of million compared to million in the year oil and gas operations year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  oil production barrels oil sales barrels oil sales average oil price per barrel gas sales mcf gas sales average gas price per mcf operating costs operating costs per boe depletion depletion per boe the calculation of barrels of oil equivalent boe is based on a conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas to one barrel bbl of crude oil to estimate relative energy content 
readers are cautioned that this conversion may be misleading  particularly when used in isolation  since the mcf bbl ratio is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent the value equivalency at the wellhead

also included in our general and administrative expenses are our compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements with employees and directors which are being expensed over their respective vesting periods of the related option grants 
the majority of the increase in the general and administrative expenses is a result of an increase in directors fees of million combined with an increase in salaries and benefits of million  travel and hotel of million  and office rent and parking of million 
these increases are consistent with the restructuring of our management team including the addition of a new executive officer combined with our stepping into new ventures and offices in israel

other increases were a result of our additional activities in israel and india offset by a small decrease for stock based compensation with non employee consultants for the year ended december  combined with a decrease as a result of the cancellation in august of the agreement to pay consulting fees to di investments ltd  whereby we expensed nil during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  professional fees professional fees increased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  professional fees include those paid to our auditors for pre approved audit  accounting and tax services and fees paid to our legal advisors primarily for services provided with regard to filing various periodic reports and other documents and reviewing our various oil and gas and other agreements 
of this increase  million is attributable to an increase in legal fees due to our increase in activities in israel and colombia combined with reviewing amendments to certain disclosure documents as a result of an sec review and an increase of million as a result of professional fees which were paid to various tax advisors to complete a review of our corporate structure with a goal to ensure tax compliance  strategy and efficiency across all jurisdictions in which we operate 
depletion and depreciation depletion and depreciation decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  as a result of our production from the tarapur field we had depletion of million or per boe for the year ended december  as compared to depletion of million or per boe for the year ended december  this decrease in depletion is mostly attributable to the substantial decrease in the amortization base for the depletion calculation as a result of impairment of oil and gas properties recognized in page

impairment of oil and gas properties during the year  we incurred asset impairment expenses of million versus nil during the year ended december  in  any impairment to exploration properties is transferred to our full cost pool which is subject to ceiling test limitations 
no impairment was recognized under our ceiling test in our asset impairment in consisted of million as a result of assessing our indian properties on an individual basis considering various factors  including land relinquishment and the absence of hydrocarbons in certain exploratory wells 
the exploration work programs have been completed on the four cambay blocks which accounted for the majority of the impairment with the relinquishment of all lands where there is not a discovery  as well as the abandonment of twenty two wells in the fourth quarter of further there was one well abandoned in one of the rajasthan blocks 
since the result of this assessment indicated impairment  the related costs incurred were charged to the statement of operations 
capitalized overhead on oil and gas properties we capitalize overhead costs directly related to our exploration activities in india 
during the year ended december   these capitalized overhead costs amounted to million as compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease is mostly attributable to a decrease in the capitalized portion of stock based compensation for our non employee consultants directly related in our oil and gas exploration activities for the year ended december  of million versus million for the year ended december  the treatment of capitalized overhead costs remained consistent with the prior year and includes costs relating to personnel  consultants  their travel  necessary resources and stock based compensation directly associated with the advancement of our oil and gas interests 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to meet potential cash requirements 
we have historically met our capital requirements through the issuance of common stock as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options to purchase common equity 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing to complete further exploration and development activities and generate profitable operations from our oil and natural gas interests in the future 
our current operations are dependent upon the adequacy of our current assets to meet our current expenditure requirements and the accuracy of management s estimates of those requirements 
should those estimates be materially incorrect  our ability to continue as a going concern will be impaired 
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
we have incurred a history of operating losses and negative cash flows from operations 
these matters may raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
at december  our cash and cash equivalents were million december  million 
the majority of this balance is being held in us funds 
we have working capital deficiency of approximately million which raises doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we expect to incur expenditures to further our exploration programs 
our existing cash balance and any anticipated cash flow from operating activities are not sufficient to satisfy our current obligations and meet our exploration commitments of million and million over the next twelve months ending december  and the three years ending december   respectively 
in addition to our exploration commitments of million  we estimate the cost of maintaining current operations through december  to be approximately million 
page 
table of contents we are considering various alternatives with respect to raising additional capital to remedy any future shortfall in capital but to date have made no specific plans or arrangements 
we deem it necessary to raise capital through equity markets  debt markets or other financing arrangements  including participation arrangements that may be available for continued exploration expenditures 
because of the early stage of our operations and our lack of any material oil and natural gas reserves  there can be no assurance this capital will be available and if it is not  we may be forced to substantially curtail or cease exploration  appraisal and development expenditures 
we believe that we will be able to raise additional capital which combined with our available cash resources will be sufficient to maintain our current level of activities through the next fiscal year 
should the going concern assumption not be appropriate and we are not able to realize our assets and settle our liabilities  commitments and contingencies in the normal course of operations  our consolidated financial statements would require adjustments to the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities  and these adjustments could be significant 
our consolidated financial statements do not reflect the adjustments or reclassifications of assets and liabilities that would be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern 
years ended december  and during the year ended december  our overall position in cash and cash equivalents increased by million  as compared to a net decrease in the comparable period of of million 
these cash movements were attributable to the following activities our net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is mostly attributable to and consistent with our increase in our professional and consulting fees  combined with our increase in our general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  as compared to the prior year 
cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to cash used in investing activities of million during the year ended december  funds of million were used for exploration activities as compared to million in the overall increase in cash provided by investing activities is attributable to funds we have received as cash calls from our myra and sara joint venture partners offset by the increase in the restricted deposits for funds held on behalf of the myra and sara joint venture partners

if the government of india approves the increase to our participating interest in the kg onshore block to  our obligations to fund the d seismic acquisition and the exploratory drilling on the block will increase 
we expect our exploration activities pursuant to our licenses in israel will continue through in accordance with the terms of those agreements 
during  we expect to complete the drilling of two deepwater exploration wells  one in each of our myra and sara licences 
in addition  we expect to complete the processing and interpretation of the recently acquired square kilometers of ocean bottom cable d seismic data and commence drilling the first exploration well in our samuel license 
in addition  we may during seek to participate in joint ventures bidding for the acquisition of oil and gas interests in israel  india  colombia and other countries 
as of march  we have no specific plans regarding such activities and have not entered into any binding agreements with respect to such activities 
we expect that our interest in any such ventures would involve a minority participating interest in the venture 
in addition  although there are no present plans to do so  as opportunities arise we may seek to acquire minority participating interests in exploration blocks where pscs or licenses have been heretofore awarded 
the acquisition of any such interests would be subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and obtaining the requisite government consents and other approvals 
as of march  the scope of any possible such activities has not been definitively established and  accordingly  we are unable to state the amount of any funds that will be required for these purposes 
as a result  no specific plans or arrangements have been made to raise additional capital and we have not entered into any agreements in that regard 
we expect that when we seek to raise additional capital it will be through the sale of equity securities  debt or other financing arrangements 
we are unable to estimate the terms on which such capital will be raised  the price per share or possible number of shares involved or the terms of any agreements to raise capital under other arrangements 
during the first quarter of  we hired one new employee in our canadian corporate office 
throughout  we hired seven full time persons in israel to support our israeli operations 
we do not expect any significant change in our number of employees in off balance sheet arrangements none 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations by type of agreement and amounts due during the year ended december  and each succeeding year thereafter 
where the amounts of payments are  this indicates we have no material obligations under such types of agreements 
payments due by period in millions contractual obligation total less than year years years more than years operating lease asset retirement obligation financial commitments under pscs financial commitments under licenses total under the production sharing and other contracts and licenses  we are obligated to pay for our proportionate share of the exploration expenses in fulfilling the minimum work programs on each of our exploration blocks and licenses 
inasmuch as exploration and drilling activities can involve unanticipated expenses and cost overruns  there can be no assurance that these management estimates will prove to be accurate 
financial commitments under the production sharing and other contracts are outlined below and include only the commitments for the current exploration phase that we are conducting 
further  as we have not yet received government of india consent to increasing our participating interest in the kg onshore block from to  our financial commitment shown in the table above includes only our participating interest 
the financial commitments under our licenses in israel only include our commitment to drill our two wells without testing

critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimated amounts due to factors such as fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates  inflation levels and commodity prices  changes in economic conditions and legislative and regulatory changes 
significant estimates with regard to the consolidated financial statements include the estimated carrying value of unproved properties  the estimated cost and timing related to asset retirement obligations  stock based compensation and contingencies 
oil and natural gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
separate cost centers are maintained for each country in which we incur costs 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities  however  are expensed in the period incurred 
to the extent that support equipment is used in oil and gas activities  the related depreciation is capitalized 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless such disposition would alter the depletion and depreciation rate by or more 
capitalized costs of development oil and natural gas properties may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proven reserves plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproven properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment is recognized 
the present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying the average first day of the month prices during the previous twelve month period of oil and natural gas to estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of year end less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
page 
table of contents following the discovery of reserves and the commencement of production  we compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
we assess all items classified as unproved property on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others land relinquishment  intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the related exploration costs incurred are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to depletion and the ceiling limitations on development oil and natural gas expenditures 
asset retirement obligation the fair values of estimated asset retirement obligations are recorded as liabilities when incurred and the associated cost is capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
the liabilities are accreted as operating expense for the change in their time value 
the initial capitalized costs are included in depletion expense in a manner consistent with the related assets 
changes in the estimated obligation resulting from revisions to the estimated timing or amount of undiscounted cash flows are recognized as a change in the asset retirement obligation and related asset 
actual expenditures incurred are charged against the accumulated obligation 
stock based compensation compensation cost for all share based payments are based on the fair value estimated and is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period for the award 
we account for transactions in which we issue equity instruments to acquire goods or services from non employees based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the fair value of share based payments is capitalized or expensed  with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital for the equity classified awards  or the share based payment liability for the liability classified awards 
upon exercise of stock options  the consideration paid upon exercise is recorded as additional value of common stock in additional paid in capital 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with the following interest rate risk we consider our exposure to interest rate risk to be immaterial 
interest rate exposures relate entirely to our investment portfolio  as we do not have short term or long term debt 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality bank issuers at overnight rates  or government securities of the united states or canadian federal governments such as guaranteed investment certificates or treasury bills 
we do not hold any of these investments for trading purposes 
we do not hold equity investments 
we do not expect any material loss from cash equivalents and therefore we believe our interest rate exposure on invested funds is not material 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially  all of our cash and cash equivalents are held in us dollars or us dollar denominated securities 
certain of our expenses are fixed or denominated by foreign currencies including the canadian dollar  the indian rupees and the new israeli shekels 
we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
at december   we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments relating to our foreign currency exchange risk 
commodity price risk oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  international supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  overall economic conditions  both international and domestic  and possible international disruptions 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our ability to obtain capital to fund our activities and could in the future require a reduction in the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
similarly  an improvement in oil and gas prices can have a favourable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
at december   we had not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments as such term is defined in item of regulation s k  relating to oil and natural gas
