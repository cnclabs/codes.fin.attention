overview fiscal was a year characterized by multiple challenges 
we continued to evolve our merchandise assortment to better resonate with our customer while navigating through a highly promotional retail environment

we also use this information to evaluate the performance of our business fiscal year ended january  january  january  net sales gross profit sg a income from operations income before income taxes income taxes net income 
table of contents sales net sales consist of sales from comparable stores  non comparable stores  and from our e commerce business 
a store is included in comparable store sales after months of operation

occupancy costs include rent  contingent rents  common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities  repairs  maintenance  depreciation and amortization and impairment charges 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to lower merchandise margin of percentage points primarily resulting from significantly increased product costs and promotional activity compared to the prior year 
additionally  the decrease in gross margin was due to a percentage point deleverage impact from occupancy  depreciation  and distribution and transportation expenses 
gross profit for fiscal was unfavorably impacted by percentage points  or by million  related to store asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal gross profit for fiscal was also favorably impacted by percentage points or by million  resulting from the resolution of a dispute with one of our sourcing agents  related to prior period allowances see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was due to lower merchandise margin of percentage points primarily resulting from higher promotional activity and markdowns compared to the prior year  higher occupancy costs of percentage points and higher depreciation costs of percentage points

liquidity and capital resources our cash requirements are primarily for working capital  construction of new stores  remodeling of existing stores  and the improvement and enhancement of our information technology systems 
due to the seasonality of our business  we have historically realized a significant portion of our cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
most recently  our cash requirements have been met primarily through cash and cash equivalents on hand during the first half of the year  and through cash flows from operations during the second half of the year 
we expect to continue to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months primarily through cash flows from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents and  if necessary our credit facility 
at january   we had working capital of million  cash and cash equivalents of million and no debt outstanding under our million credit facility 
the following table sets forth our cash flows for the period indicated in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities cash flows from operating activities  our principal form of liquidity on a full year basis  decreased by million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to the decrease in net income of million  and was partially offset by the timing cash flows from operating assets and liabilities 
cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to the timing of income tax payments  supplemental executive retirement plan serp payments that were included in accrued expenses at january   and incentive compensation liability payments 
in addition  cash used for merchandise inventories increased during fiscal investing activities we invested million in capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily to construct new a ropostale stores  ps from a ropostale stores  to remodel existing stores and for a number of information technology investments 
our future capital requirements will depend primarily on the number of new stores we open  the number of existing stores we remodel and other strategic investments

financing activities we repurchase our common stock from time to time under a stock repurchase program 
the repurchase program may be modified or terminated by the board of directors at any time  and there is no expiration date for the program 
the extent and timing of repurchases will depend upon general business and market conditions  stock prices  opening and closing of the stock trading window  and liquidity and capital resource requirements going forward 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million  which were purchased during the first quarter 
during fiscal and  we repurchased million shares for million and million shares for million  respectively 
program to date  we repurchased million shares for billion  at an average price of per share 
as of january   we have approximately million of repurchase authorization remaining under our billion share repurchase program 
revolving credit facility on september   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility with bank of america  na the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for and up to million revolving credit line 
the credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire on september   and is guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries the guarantors 
the credit facility replaces a facility that provided for up to million revolving credit line and was scheduled to expire on november  the prior credit facility 
no amounts were outstanding during fiscal or as of january  under the current or prior credit facility see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
management has no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement in the event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future 
loans under the credit facility are secured by all our assets and are guaranteed by the guarantors 
upon the occurrence of a cash dominion event as defined in the credit facility and includes either any event of default or failure to maintain availability in an amount greater than of the lesser of the borrowing base and facility commitment our ability to borrow funds  make investments  pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock would be limited  among other limitations 
direct borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a margin over either libor or at the prime rate as each such term is defined in the credit facility 

table of contents the credit facility also contains covenants that  subject to specified exceptions  restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt or encumber assets of the company  merge with or acquire other companies  liquidate or dissolve  sell  transfer  lease or dispose of assets  and make loans or guarantees 
events of default under the credit facility include  subject to grace periods and notice provisions in certain circumstances  failure to pay principal amounts when due  breaches of covenants  misrepresentation  default on leases or other indebtedness  excess uninsured casualty loss  excess uninsured judgment or restraint of business  business failure or application for bankruptcy  institution of legal process or proceedings under federal  state or civil statutes  legal challenges to loan documents and a change in control 
if an event of default occurs  the lender will be entitled to take various actions  including the acceleration of amounts due thereunder and requiring that all such amounts be immediately paid in full as well as possession and sale of all assets that have been used as collateral 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility  the lender may cease making loans  terminate the credit facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
upon the occurrence of our loan availability under the credit facility decreasing below of the lesser of the borrowing base and the dollar amount of commitments under the credit facility  we would be required to meet a financial covenant for a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to as of january   we are not aware of any instances of noncompliance with any covenants or any other event of default under the credit facility 
during fiscal and as of january   we had no outstanding balances or stand by or commercial letters of credit issued under the prior credit facility or the credit facility contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations real estate operating leases employment agreements equipment operating leases total contractual obligations the real estate operating leases included in the above table do not include contingent rent based upon sales volume  which amounted to approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal in addition  the above table does not include variable costs paid to landlords such as maintenance  insurance and taxes  which represented approximately of minimum lease obligations in fiscal our open purchase orders are cancelable without penalty and are therefore not included in the above table 
as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have a serp liability of million at january  and other retirement plan liabilities of million at january  such liability amounts are not reflected in the table above 
our total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits were million at january  we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the amount and timing of related future payments for these non current liabilities of million 
therefore these liabilities were not included in the above table 

table of contents in august  we entered into a new three year sourcing agreement with one of our sourcing agents 
the sourcing agreement may be terminated at any time during the term by mutual agreement of the parties and provided that appropriate notice is given in accordance with the agreement 
in connection with the sourcing agreement  we have a guaranteed minimum product purchase commitment of million that is measured over any consecutive two year period during the term of the agreement 
if we purchase less than this amount over the two year measurement period  then we will be obligated to pay the contracted commission on the shortfall from the guaranteed minimum 
as of january   we expect to meet our minimum product purchase commitment 
in addition  if we were to cancel purchase orders with this sourcing agent  we may have to reimburse the agent for costs and expenses  if any  that it had incurred 
we had not issued any other third party guarantees or commercial commitments as of january  the above table also does not include contingent bonus compensation agreements with certain of our employees 
the bonuses become payable if the individual is employed by us on the future payment date 
the amount of conditional bonuses that may be paid is million during fiscal and million during fiscal we have employment agreements with thomas p 
johnson  our chief executive officer and michael j 
cunningham  our president 
the total contractual commitment for these agreements combined is million as of january  the table above reflects the aforementioned agreements included in employment agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating lease commitments set forth in the table above  we are not a party to any material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
we have not created  and are not a party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
as of january   we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information 
therefore  actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in applying such policies  management must use significant estimates that are based on its informed judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
changes in such estimates  based on more accurate future information  may affect amounts reported in future periods 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a weighted average basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  a difference in our estimate of inventory at the lower of cost or market as of january  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes asc 
under asc  income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements and requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit is recognized 
where applicable  associated interest and penalties are also recorded 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
management makes assumptions and applies judgment to estimate future cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital 
these assumptions include factors such as historical and forecasted results and trends 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge 
additionally  we have recorded store impairment charges of million for stores in fiscal compared to million for one store in fiscal and million for six stores in fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of january  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated which could result in additional impairments of store long lived assets in future periods  and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit retirement plan we maintain a serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp non current liability of million is appropriately stated as of january  however  actual results may differ from those estimated and could have an impact on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
for example  if we had changed the expected discount rate by in fiscal  pension expense would have changed by less than  recent accounting developments see the section recent accounting developments included in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting developments and their impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  we had no stand by or commercial letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
to the extent that we may borrow pursuant to the credit facility in the future  we may be exposed to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations 
unrealized foreign currency gains and losses  resulting from the translation of our canadian subsidiary s financial statements into our us dollar reporting currency are reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the balance of the unrealized gain included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was million as of january  a movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a fair value translation fluctuation of approximately million  which would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as an unrealized gain or loss 
we also face transactional currency exposures relating to merchandise that our canadian subsidiary purchases using us dollars 
these foreign currency transaction gains and losses are charged or credited to earnings as incurred 
we do not hedge our exposure to this currency exchange fluctuation  and transaction gains and losses to date have not been significant
