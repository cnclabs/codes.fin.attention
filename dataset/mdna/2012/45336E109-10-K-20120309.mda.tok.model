our significant accounting policies  including those considered to be critical accounting policies  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
overview we began in as a reseller of telecommunications services and have evolved to become a leading provider of end to end  cloud based contact center software services and network connectivity 
we strive to deliver the most proven solutions quickly and with ease  helping our customers reduce the cost and improve the quality of every user interaction 
we began offering cloud based software solutions to the contact center market in our dynamic technology platform provides our customers a solution without the costs and complexities of legacy systems 
our proven delivery model provides cost savings and removes the complexities of deploying and maintaining a premised based solution  while providing flexibility to change with business needs 
we provide software which includes automatic call distribution with skills based routing  interactive voice response with speech recognition  computer telephony integration capabilities  reporting  workforce optimization  e learning  contact center agent hiring and customer feedback measurement tools 
taken together  the incontact cloud based platform creates an integrated solution for contact centers  including those with distributed workforces either at home or multi site 

table of contents recent developments our primary financial objective is to generate recurring cloud based software revenue from sustainable sources by investing in various cloud based software growth initiatives  as we believe we are in the early stages of a large  long term market 
in the past  we have grown that business through our direct sales initiatives and referral partner arrangements 
we added a new sales channel in in june  we entered into our first reseller agreement for our cloud based contact center solutions with siemens 
siemens is a world wide distributor reseller of our portfolio of cloud based software solutions  which includes the exclusive right to sell our solutions in emea 
in november  we entered into a north america reseller agreement with verizon 
our new opportunity in is to leverage the marketing and sales capacity of these large enterprises selling to call center owners and operators to substantially increase our business in north america and establish our business overseas all of which we believe will generate significant growth in our recurring cloud based software revenue 
this new opportunity means we must invest in the infrastructure required to deliver our cloud based software to new enterprise and international customers and increase our customer service and support capacity 
we began making that investment in  and were able to fund our expenditures in  as well as expected expenditures in  with the million we raised from the sale of million shares of common stock to a parent company of siemens 
even so  the investment we made increased our cost of services and other operating expenses in  which adversely affected our margins and results of operations 
our ability to recoup that investment depends on how successful our reseller strategy is in and beyond  but we are able to mitigate the risk associated with future realization of sales by obtaining minimum purchase commitments from siemens to generate million of net software revenue in and million in trends in our business there has been in increase in costs of revenue during due to greater professional service and customer service personnel costs as we employ more personnel  including higher paid employees with more developed skill sets to service larger mid market and enterprise customers  greater direct costs attributable to establishing our international infrastructure and international call traffic  and an increase in amortization of previously capitalized internal use software costs 
we expect costs of revenue in absolute dollars to continue to increase  but we expect the costs of revenue as a percentage of sales to decrease as we anticipate an increase in revenue as a result of developing the infrastructure to service more enterprise and international customers  investing in sales and marketing activities  and from the additional sales channel added during from entering into reseller agreements with siemens and verizon 
we experienced an increase in telecom segment revenue for the first time in several years 
the increase is associated with the increase in telecom revenue from our incontact portfolio customers exceeding lost revenue from attrition of our telecom only customers 
we expect the telecom revenue from our incontact portfolio customer to continue to exceed the attrition of our telecom only customers in sources of revenue we derive our revenues from two major business activities delivery and support of our incontact portfolio of software services and associated professional services and reselling telecommunication services 
our primary business focus is marketing and selling our incontact portfolio 
software software delivery and support of our incontact portfolio is provided on a monthly recurring subscription basis 
monthly recurring charges are billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
in addition to the monthly recurring revenue  revenue is also received on a non recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a user s incontact portfolio experience 
customers access 
table of contents cloud based software and data through a secure internet connection 
support services include technical assistance for our software products and product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
our telecommunications and data network is fundamental to our incontact portfolio and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
telecom we continue to derive revenue from traditional telecommunications services such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
revenue for transactional long distance usage is derived based on user specific rate plans and the user s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
users are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date 
costs of revenue and operating expenses costs of revenue costs of revenue consist primarily of payments to third party long distance service providers for resold telecommunication services to our customers 
costs of revenue also include salaries including stock based compensation and related expenses for our software services delivery  support and professional services organizations  equipment depreciation relating to our services  amortization of acquired intangible assets  amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs  and allocated overhead  such as rent  utilities and depreciation on property and equipment 
as a result  overhead expenses are included in costs of revenue and each operating expense category 
the cost associated with providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than the cost associated with delivering our software services due to the labor costs associated with providing professional services 
we anticipate that we will incur additional costs for long distance service providers  hosting  support  employee salaries and related expenses  to support delivery of our software solutions in the future 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock based compensation and related expenses for employees in sales and marketing  including commissions and bonuses  advertising  marketing events  corporate communications  expenses  travel costs and allocated overhead 
since our software segment revenue is delivered and therefore recognized over time  we have experienced a delay between increasing sales and marketing expenses and the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we believe it is important to continue investing in selling and marketing to create brand awareness and lead generation opportunities  to increase market share and to support the resellers added in accordingly  we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support growth initiatives 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of the non capitalized portion of salary including stock based compensation and related expenses for development personnel and costs related to the development of new products  enhancement of existing products  quality assurance  market research  testing  product management and allocated overhead 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we intend to release new features and functionality on a frequent basis  expand our content offerings  upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary including stock based compensation and related expenses for management  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we anticipate that we will incur additional employee salaries and related expenses  professional service fees and other corporate expenses related to the growth of our business and operations in the future 
as such  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars

segment reporting we operate under two business segments software and telecom 
the software segment includes all monthly recurring subscription revenue related to the delivery of our software applications plus the associated professional services and setup fees related to the software services product features referred to as cloud based or saas 
the telecom segment includes all voice and data long distance services provided to customers 
for segment reporting  we classify operating expenses as either direct or indirect 
direct expense refers to costs attributable solely to either selling and marketing efforts or research and development efforts 
indirect expense refers to costs that management considers to be overhead in running the business 
management evaluates expenditures for both selling and marketing and research and development efforts at the segment level without the allocation of overhead expenses  such as rent  utilities and depreciation on property and equipment

liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit note  which expires in july at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
in addition to our million of cash and cash equivalents  subject to meeting covenant requirements  we have access to additional available borrowings under our revolving credit note with zions first national bank zions entered into in july the available borrowings under the revolving credit note are million at december   based on the maximum available advance amount calculated on the december  borrowing base certificate  resulting in total cash and additional availability under the revolving credit note of million at december  the balance of our revolving credit note at december  was million and the proceeds were used to take advantage of vendor discounts on early payment terms 
we had no outstanding balance during most of the fourth quarter 
the outstanding balance of our revolving credit agreement ranged from to million during and we paid the outstanding balance of million in january we experienced a net loss of million during the year ended december  significant non cash expenses affecting operations during were million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
the non cash expenses were offset by an increase in accounts receivable resulting in million of cash being used in our operating activities during our working capital of million at december  increased significantly from million at december  the increase is primarily due to proceeds of million received from the sale of stock in june  partially offset by net payments of million on our revolving credit note  million used for investing activities and net cash of used for operating activities 
in march  we entered into an equipment leasing facility commitment with zions credit corporation zions credit 
under the terms of the leasing facility commitment  zions credit agreed to provide us with financing of up to million to lease computer related equipment for our business operations  which zions credit will lease to us in the form of a capital lease 
the term of the facility is months upon acceptance of the leased property by us 
the calculated interest rate is subject to change based on the three year libor plus 
we had million of capital lease obligations related to this leasing facility at december  and million of this leasing facility had not been utilized at december  and is available for use 
the final lease payments for the utilized portion of the leasing facility will be in november we continue to take a proactive approach in managing our operating expenditures and cash flow from operations 
we expect to rely on internally generated cash  our revolving credit facility and our equipment leasing facility to finance operations and capital requirements 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  available borrowings under our revolving credit note and available borrowings under our equipment leasing facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements during at least the next twelve months 
revolving credit note on july   we entered into a revolving credit loan agreement the revolving credit agreement with zions 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  zions has agreed to loan up to million under a 
table of contents revolving credit note

we paid down million on the revolving credit agreement during and drew million from our revolving credit agreement during all outstanding principal under the zions agreement is due in july the amount outstanding at december  was million 
in january  we paid the outstanding balance of million 
the zions revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants  with the most significant covenants being a requirement to maintain a specified minimum liquidity position and minimum quarterly ebitda defined as earnings before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  a requirement to maintain a minimum working capital balance and a requirement to maintain a minimum cash balance  which were established by amendment to the revolving credit agreement in june as of december   the minimum liquidity position and minimum quarterly ebitda covenant requires that the aggregate value of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities shall not be less than the outstanding balance on the revolving credit agreement plus million  and if at any time the aggregate value is less than the minimum liquidity position  a minimum quarterly ebitda of million  calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter  is required 
based on our projections  we believe we will maintain compliance with our loan covenants through  however if future operating results are less favorable than currently anticipated  we may need to seek further amendments to modify our loan covenants 
if we are unable to modify the loan covenants on acceptable terms  we would intend to reduce spending levels or take other restructuring actions 
the minimum working capital covenant requires minimum working capital of million at all times during the term of the agreement and the minimum cash balance covenant requires a minimum cash balance of million or the amount available under the line is reduced to of billed accounts receivable 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants related to the revolving credit agreement for the year ended december  the interest rate under the zions revolving credit note is day libor plus  adjusted as of the date of any change in the libor

critical accounting estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue is determined and recognized based on the type of service provided for the customer as follows incontact portfolio of services 
revenue is derived from the delivery of any of our software services within the incontact portfolio which are provided on a monthly recurring subscription basis 
monthly recurring subscription charges are generally billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
for subscription contracts with multiple elements hosted software  training  installation and long distance services  we follow the guidance provided in asc  revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  because customers do not have the right to take possession of the software 
as such  these arrangements are considered service contracts and are not 
table of contents within the scope of industry topic  software 
in addition to the monthly recurring subscription revenue  revenue is also derived on a non recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a customer s incontact portfolio experience 
because our professional services  such as training and installation  are not considered to have standalone value  we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services in multiple element arrangements and recognize such fees as revenue over the estimated life of the customer 
professional services sold separately ie not sold contemporaneously with the negotiation of a subscription contract are recognized as revenue over the period that services are provided 
fees for telecommunications services in multiple element arrangements with in the incontact portfolio are based on usage and are recognized as revenue in the same manner as fees for telecommunications services discussed in the following paragraph 
telecommunications services 
revenue is derived from telecommunications services  such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
our network is the backbone of our incontact portfolio and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
revenue for the telecommunications usage is derived based on customer specific rate plans and the customer s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
customers are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  earned but unbilled revenues are recognized as revenue for incurred usage to date 
during the three months ended december   we determined that we had a sufficient amount of transaction history to estimate the life of a customer and began recognizing the revenue for upfront fees for professional services over the estimated life of a customer 
previously  we had recognized upfront fees for professional services over the life of the contract  as we did not have sufficient history with our customer base to estimate customer life 
therefore  prior to the fourth quarter of  we used contract life as a proxy for customer life 
this change in estimate was accounted for prospectively for all new and existing arrangements  and resulted in recognizing approximately  less in revenue during the fourth quarter of accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable is composed of billed amounts as well as unbilled amounts for which revenue has been earned and recognized 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts  an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable outstanding of which management believes may be uncollectible  is determined each month principally based on the aging of receivables 
management reviews the current trends and aged receivables periodically and adjusts the estimated bad debt expense to accrue for doubtful accounts as needed 
an account is written off by management when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts may continue 
long lived assets we estimate the useful lives of long lived assets in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
depreciation and amortization expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
long lived assets consist of property and equipment computer equipment  software  furniture and equipment 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 
intangible assets we estimate the useful lives of intangibles  which include acquired customer lists  patents and acquired technology  in order to determine the amount of amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
we use an accelerated method to amortize customer lists acquired after other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
we test intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows 
table of contents will be less than carrying values 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product  and or the partial or complete lapse of continuing technology rights protection 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis on september of each year and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable using a two step process 
first  the fair values are estimated using a market based valuation approach utilizing a multiple of revenues 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments  including judgments about relevant revenue multiples of comparable companies 
we have two reporting units identified as our segments  telecom and software 
all of the goodwill of million relates to the software reporting unit 
therefore  only the carrying value of the software reporting unit was evaluated 
if the carrying value of the software reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step is performed  and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount  if any  by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
at september   the fair value of the software reporting unit exceeded its carrying value so no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended december  there were no events or circumstances from the date of our assessment through december  that would impact this assessment 
income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred income tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
to date  a valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the deferred income tax assets 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment  and it is difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of the deferred tax assets are realizable 
the amounts relating to taxes also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions  however  tax audits  changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes 
management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters 
however  to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts  we may be required to adjust our tax amounts resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
however  we have purchase commitments with two national long distance telecommunication providers and our operating leases 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires measurement of compensation cost for equity based awards ie  stock options  warrants and restricted stock units at fair value on date of grant and recognition of the fair value of compensation for awards expected to vest over the requisite service period 
we utilize the graded vesting method  rather than a straight line method  for recognizing compensation expense as management believes this graded vesting method more closely matches the expense to associated services 
under this method  nearly of the compensation cost is expensed in the first year of a typical three year vesting term 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
management considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents are invested with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the short term nature of the cash equivalents  we believe that we are not subject to any material interest rate risk as it relates to interest income 
interest rates on some of our outstanding leases and revolving credit facility are variable so market fluctuations in interest rate may increase our interest expense
