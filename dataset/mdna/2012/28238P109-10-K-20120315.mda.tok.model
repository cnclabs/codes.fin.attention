our ecommerce technology also enables us to deliver consumers health insurance applications electronically to health insurance carriers 
as a result  we simplify and streamline the complex and traditionally paper intensive health insurance sales and purchasing process

commission revenue represented  and of total revenue for the years  and  respectively 
the commission payments we receive are typically a percentage of the premium on an individual  family or small business health insurance policy that we sold and are typically made to us on a monthly basis for as long as a policy remains active with us 
we began actively marketing the availability of medicare related health insurance plans during through our online medicare plan platforms www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www

in april  we acquired planprescriber  inc  a privately held provider of online tools to help medicare eligible individuals navigate medicare health insurance options 
our medicare plan platforms enable consumers to research and compare medicare related health insurance plans  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
commission payments we receive for medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans sold by us are typically fixed and are earned over a period of up to six years  or longer depending on the carrier arrangement  and are paid to us either monthly or annually 
medicare commissions we receive are included in commission revenue 
as a result of our commission structure  much of our revenue for a given financial reporting period relates to health insurance plans that we sold prior to the beginning of the period and is recurring in nature 
additionally  health insurance pricing  which is set by the health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators  is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors 
in march  the federal patient protection and affordable care act and related amendments in the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law 
these health care reform laws contain provisions that have and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways 
among several other provisions  they include a mandate requiring individuals to be insured or face tax penalties  a mandate that certain employers offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties  a requirement that persons years of age and younger be able to stay on a parent s health insurance plan  prohibitions against insurance companies using pre existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance  establishment of state and or federal health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to  and the purchase of  health insurance  subsidies and cost sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels  and medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that 
table of contents improve health care quality and  if they do not  to provide rebates to policyholders 
while many aspects of health care reform do not become effective until  health insurance carriers have been required to maintain medical loss ratios of eighty percent in their individual and family health insurance business since the beginning of the implementation of the medical loss ratio requirements by insurance carriers has resulted in a reduction in the commission rates that we are paid as a result of our selling individual and family health insurance plans 
these commission rate changes began to impact our individual and family health insurance plan commission based revenue in we derive revenue from our online sponsorship advertising program that allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee and a performance based fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
we also offer medicare sponsorship services  which allow medicare plan carriers to purchase advertising on a separate website developed  hosted and maintained by us 
in these instances  we are typically paid a fixed  up front fee  which we recognize as revenue over the service period 
we derive revenue from licensing the use of our health insurance ecommerce technology 
our technology platform enables health insurance carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance plans online 
we also recently began to license our ecommerce technology for use by government agencies and intend to market this technology to states implementing health insurance exchanges as a result of health care reform legislation 
the medicare revenue we have generated also includes referral fees paid to us based on medicare leads generated by our online platforms that are delivered and sold to third parties 
although we expect to continue to sell medicare leads to third parties in the future  we intend to perform services for an increasing number of our medicare leads ourselves as a health insurance agent 
to the extent that we do so  we will be entitled to receive commissions rather than a one time referral fee 
sources of revenue commission revenue we generate revenue primarily from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers whose health insurance policies are purchased through us 
commissions for individual  family and small business health insurance policies sold by us generally represent a percentage of the insurance premium and  to a much lesser extent  commission override payments that insurance carriers pay us for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives 
commission rates vary by carrier and by the type of plan purchased by a member 
commission rates can vary based upon the amount of time that the policy has been active  with commission rates for individual and family plans typically being higher in the first twelve months of the policy 
after the first twelve months  commission rates generally decline significantly 
as a result  if we do not add a sufficient number of members on new policies  our revenue growth will be negatively impacted 
individuals  families and small businesses purchasing health insurance through us typically pay their premiums on a monthly basis 
insurance carriers typically pay commissions to us on these policies monthly  after they receive the premium payment from the member 
we generally continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
as a result  the majority of our commission revenue is recurring in nature 
our individual and family health insurance plan commission revenue was adversely impacted in due to the reduction in the commission rates that we are paid on new policies as a result of our selling individual and family health insurance plans subsequent to the implementation of the new medical loss ratio requirements beginning in commission rate changes due to the implementation of the new medical loss ratio requirements applied prospectively to applicable commissions earned on or after january  and the majority of the changes applied only to commissions earned on new individual and family plan members approved in and thereafter 
we define a member as an individual covered by an insurance plan for  including individual  family  medicare related  small business  short term and ancillary plans  which we are 
table of contents entitled to receive compensation 
for the majority of individual and family plan members that were approved prior to the effective date of the commission rate changes  we are being paid commissions at the rates in effect prior to the changes 
as a result  the adverse impact to our overall individual and family health insurance commission rate structure is phasing in as the number of members approved after the commission rate changes becomes a greater proportion of our individual and family plan membership 
although we expect our overall individual and family health insurance commission rate structure to stabilize by early  our actual future commission rates will depend on the mix between individual and family plan members approved prior to the commission rate changes and those approved after the changes  the number of existing and new medicare plan members  and the mix of new approved members by state  health insurance carrier and type of health plan  among other factors 
additionally  other programs that health insurance carriers have supported  such as commission overrides and sponsorship advertising programs  have also been reduced as carriers look to reduce costs to comply with the new medical loss ratio requirements 
during  the number of applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance declined compared to partially offsetting this decline was an increase in the number of individuals per approved application for individual and family health insurance during the number of individuals approved for individual and family health insurance declined in compared to additionally  an increase in the number of individuals approved for medicare insurance and other ancillary products during partially offset the decline in the number of individuals approved for individual and family health insurance 
we believe the decrease in the number of applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance was impacted by certain healthcare reform provisions of the federal patient protection and affordable care act  including a provision that allows individuals to years of age the option of staying on their parents policies 
we also believe the decrease in the number of applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance was impacted by our decision to reduce our marketing and advertising spending in our online advertising channel relating to those plans given the reduction in the commission rates that we are paid on new individual and family plans as a result of the implementation of the new medical loss ratio requirements beginning in we believe the increase in the number of individuals per approved application resulted in part from a provision in the federal patient protection and affordable care act that prohibits health insurance carriers from denying applications for child only health insurance plans for health reasons 
many carriers have since dropped child only plans from their offerings  which has caused us to receive fewer applications for child only plans and more applications with an adult and a child together 
we generally recognize individual  family and small business health insurance plan revenue when commissions are reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an estimate for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we generally receive these communications simultaneously 
in instances when we receive the cash payment and commission statement separately and in different accounting periods  we recognize revenue in the period that we receive the earliest communication  provided we receive the second corroborating communication shortly after the end of the accounting period 
if the second corroborating communication is not received shortly after the end of the accounting period  we recognize revenue in the period the second communication is received 
we use the data in the commission statements to help identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate forfeitures payable to carriers 
as a result  we recognize the net amount of compensation earned as the agent in the transaction 
commission override revenue  which we recognize on the same basis as premium commissions  is generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenue for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override revenue to us 
commission revenue attributable to major medical individual and family health insurance plans was approximately  and of our commission revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
major medical individual and family health insurance plans do not include small business  short term major medical  stand alone dental  life  student and medicare related health insurance plan offerings 

table of contents we began actively marketing the availability of medicare related insurance plans during through our online medicare plan platforms www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com 
these platforms enable consumers to research and compare medicare related insurance plans  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began to offer online application capabilities for certain medicare plans and  through our customer care centers in gold river  california  salt lake city  utah and maynard  massachusetts  we offer telephonic enrollment capabilities for medicare related insurance plans as well as other health insurance plans  including individual and family health insurance plans 
to the extent that we assist in the sale of medicare related insurance plans as a health insurance agent  through either online applications or telephonically  we generate revenue from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers 
the commission payments we receive for medicare supplement plans are typically a percentage of the premium on the policy that we sold and are paid to us on a monthly basis for as long as a policy remains active with us 
for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans  we receive a fixed  annual commission from insurance carriers once the policy is approved by the carrier and either a fixed  monthly commission beginning with and subsequent to the second policy year for a medicare advantage policy or a fixed  annual commission beginning with and subsequent to the second policy year for a medicare part d prescription drug policy 
we may earn commission revenue for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans typically for a period of up to six years  or longer depending on the carrier arrangement  provided that the policy remains active with us 
we recognize commission revenue for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans for the entire policy year once the annual or first monthly commission amount for the policy year is reported to us by the carrier  net of an estimate for future forfeiture amounts due to policy cancellations 
for commissions paid to us on a monthly basis  we record a receivable for the commission amounts to be received over the remainder of the policy year  net of an estimate for commission amounts not expected to be collected due to policy cancellations  which is included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets 
we continue to receive the commission payments from the relevant insurance carrier until the earlier of our being notified that the health insurance policy has been cancelled  our no longer remaining the agent on the policy  or our commission term with the carrier expires  typically up to six years from the effective date of the policy 
we determine that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement when we have a commission agreement with a health insurance carrier 
our services are complete when a carrier has approved an application in the initial year and when a member has renewed in a renewal year 
the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured when a carrier has approved an application and the carrier reports to us the annual or first monthly renewal commission amount for each policy year 
we expect to recognize a majority of our first year medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan commission revenue in the fourth quarter of each year as a result of the medicare annual enrollment period  which occurs in the fourth quarter of each year 
additionally  we expect to recognize a majority of our renewal medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plan commission revenue in the first quarter of each year as policies sold during the annual enrollment period typically renew on january of each year 
we expect commission revenue to increase in absolute dollars in compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in medicare related commission revenue 
other revenue in addition to the commission revenue we derive from the sale of health insurance plans  we derive other revenue from generating and delivering leads  primarily for medicare plans  from licensing the use of our ecommerce technology and from our online sponsorship and advertising program 
online sponsorship advertising 
we derive revenue from our online sponsorship advertising program that allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee and a performance based fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
we also offer sponsorship services for our medicare plan carriers to purchase advertising 
table of contents on a separate website developed  hosted and maintained by us 
in these instances  we are typically paid a fixed  up front fee  which we recognize as revenue over the service period 
technology licensing 
we derive revenue from licensing the use of our health insurance ecommerce technology 
our technology platform enables health insurance carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance plans online 
in our technology licensing business  we are paid implementation fees and performance based fees that are based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party 
in addition  we generate revenue based on performance criteria that are either measured based on data tracked by us  or based on data tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data are tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data are tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
we license our technology for use by government agencies and we are currently marketing our ecommerce technology to states implementing health insurance exchanges as a result of health care reform legislation 
in our government systems business  which may also include information services  we may earn a combination of fixed license fees and time and materials based fees or we may be paid performance based fees 
medicare lead referral 
our online medicare plan platforms www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com enable consumers to research and compare medicare related insurance plans  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
the medicare related revenue we have generated includes referral fees paid to us based on medicare leads generated by our online platforms that are delivered and sold to third parties 
the majority of our lead referral revenue is generated during the medicare annual enrollment period  which occurs during the fourth quarter of the calendar year  when we generate and sell the majority of our medicare leads 
although we expect to continue to sell medicare leads to a single lead purchaser in the future  we intend to perform services for a greater number of our medicare leads ourselves as a health insurance agent 
to the extent that we do so  we will be entitled to receive commissions rather than a one time referral fee 
we expect other revenue to be similar in absolute dollars in compared to member acquisition an important factor in our revenue growth is the growth of our member base 
our marketing initiatives are an important component of our strategy to grow our member base and are focused on three primary member acquisition channels direct  marketing partners and online advertising 
our marketing initiatives are primarily designed to encourage consumers to complete an online application for health insurance on our ecommerce platform 
in addition  we may refer medicare eligible individuals to third parties who may assist them in enrolling in a medicare plan 
our marketing channels are as follows direct 
our direct member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website addresses www 
ehealth 
com  www 
ehealthinsurance 
com  www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com either directly or through algorithmic natural search listings on internet search engines and directories 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance from our direct channel constituted  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
marketing partners 
our marketing partner member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our websites through a network of affiliate partners and financial services and other companies 
growth in our marketing partner channel depends upon our expanding marketing programs with existing partners and adding new partners to our network 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted 
table of contents through us for individual and family health insurance plans from our marketing partner member acquisition channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
online advertising 
our online advertising member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our websites through paid keyword search advertising from search engines such as google  bing and yahoo  as well as various internet marketing programs such as banner advertising and email marketing 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance plans from our online advertising channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
in additional to our member acquisition channels  we have acquired both individual and family plan and medicare plan members through agreements with certain business development partners  whereby these partners have transferred certain of their existing individual and family plan and medicare plan members to us as the broker of record on the underlying policies 
operating costs and expenses cost of revenue included in cost of revenue are payments related to health insurance policies sold to members who were referred to our website by marketing partners with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements 
in order to enter into a revenue sharing arrangement  marketing partners must be licensed to sell health insurance in the state where the policy is sold 
costs related to revenue sharing arrangements are expensed as the related revenue is recognized 
cost of revenue also includes direct labor and other direct costs incurred in connection with our government systems activities 
initial direct labor and other direct costs incurred prior to the availability of our technology for use by a government agency were deferred and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet and were amortized to cost of revenue from the date our technology was available for use by the government agency in october to the end of the initial one year term of the contract in july direct labor and other direct costs incurred subsequent to the availability of our technology for use by the government agency are recognized as cost of revenue as incurred 
the term of this contract expired in january additionally  cost of revenue includes the amortization of consideration we paid to certain brokers in connection with the transfer of their health insurance members to us as the new broker of record on the underlying policies 
these transfers have included both individual and family plan members as well as medicare plan members 
in november  we entered into an agreement with a partner  whereby the partner transferred certain of its existing medicare plan members to us as the broker of record on the underlying policies for arrangement consideration totaling million 
in may and october  we entered into similar agreements with the same partner  whereby the partner transferred certain of its existing medicare plan members to us as the broker of record on the underlying policies 
total consideration was million and million for the may and october arrangements  respectively 
all book of business transfers are being amortized to cost of revenue as we recognize commission revenue related to the transferred members over a period of up to five years for each arrangement 
we expect cost of revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in compared to due to a decrease in direct labor and other direct costs incurred in connection with the expiration of the contract with the federal government in january  partially offset by an increase in amortization of the consideration we paid in connection with the transfer of certain medicare members to us from a partner 

table of contents marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expenses consist primarily of member acquisition expenses associated with our direct  marketing partner and online advertising member acquisition channels  in addition to compensation and other expenses related to marketing  business development  partner management  public relations and carrier relations personnel who support our offerings 
our direct channel expenses primarily consist of costs for television advertising  radio advertising  print advertising  direct mail and email marketing 
our marketing partner channel expenses consist primarily of fees paid to marketing partners with which we have a relationship 
we compensate a significant number of our marketing partners by paying a fee each time a consumer referral from a partner results in a submitted health insurance application on our ecommerce platform  regardless of whether the consumer s application is approved by the health insurance carrier 
many of our marketing partners have tiered arrangements in which the amount of the fee increases as the volume of submitted applications we receive from the marketing partner increases over a particular period 
we recognize these expenditures in the period when a marketing partner s referral results in the submission of a health insurance application on our website 
the number of individual and family health insurance applications submitted through our ecommerce platform has generally increased in our first quarter compared to our fourth quarter and in our third quarter compared to our second quarter 
conversely  we have generally experienced a decline or flattening in individual and family submitted applications in our second quarter compared to our first quarter and in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter 
since a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our website  those expenses are influenced by these patterns 
in addition  because the total volume of submitted applications that we receive from our marketing partners is largely outside of our control  particularly during any short term period  and because of our tiered marketing partner arrangements  we could incur expenses in excess of  or below  the amounts we had planned in periods of rapid change in the volume of submitted applications from marketing partner referrals 
an unanticipated increase in submitted applications resulting from marketing partner referrals could cause our net income to be lower than our expectation  since the revenue to be derived from submitted applications that are approved by health insurance carriers will not be recognized until future periods 
paid keyword search advertising on search engines represents the majority of expenses in our online advertising channel 
we incur expenses associated with search engine advertising in the period in which the consumer clicks on the advertisement 
similar to our marketing partner channel  expenses in our online advertising channel will increase or decrease in relation to any increase or decrease in consumers referred to our website as a result of such search engine advertising 
for example  due to the substantial increase in the number of consumers referred to our website from paid keyword search advertising performed during the medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant increase in online advertising expenses during the fourth quarter of compared to other quarters in we also increased our discretionary medicare plan related online advertising spending in the third and fourth quarters of  compared to first and second quarters  in conjunction with the medicare annual enrollment period in the fourth quarter of because the majority of our medicare plan related revenue is not generated until the fourth quarter  our discretionary online advertising expenses had a negative impact on our profitability during the third quarter of we expect these seasonal patterns to occur in we expect our marketing and advertising expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to an increase in our medicare related online marketing and advertising expenditures during  including paid keyword search advertising 
customer care and enrollment customer care and enrollment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits costs for personnel engaged in pre sales assistance to applicants who call our customer care center and for enrollment personnel who assist applicants during the underwriting process 
in the second half of  we began hiring  training and obtaining health insurance licenses and health insurance carrier appointments for additional employees in our 
table of contents customer care centers to service the increase in the volume of medicare leads we received in the fourth quarter of as a result of the medicare annual enrollment period 
most of these additional customer care center employees were temporary and their employment ended after the conclusion of the medicare annual enrollment period in december as a result of our temporary customer care center staffing requirements  we expect our customer care and enrollment costs to be higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year compared to the first and second quarters 
because the majority of our medicare plan related revenue is not generated until the fourth quarter  our temporary customer care center staffing costs incurred in the third quarter have had a significant negative impact on our profitability during the third quarter 
we expect this seasonal pattern to occur in we expect customer care and enrollment expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of additional personnel we expect to hire to service the expected increase in the volume of medicare demand in and due to an increase in expenditures to develop and expand our medicare plan sales capabilities 
technology and content technology and content expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits costs for personnel associated with developing and enhancing our website technology as well as maintaining our website 
a majority of our technology and content group is located at our wholly owned subsidiary in china  where technology development costs are generally lower than in the united states 
we expect technology and content expenses to remain relatively flat in absolute dollars in compared to general and administrative general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits costs for staff working in our executive  finance  corporate development  investor relations  government affairs  legal  human resources  internal audit  facilities and internal information technology departments 
these expenses also include fees paid for outside professional services  including audit  tax  legal  government affairs and information technology fees 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decline in compared to due primarily to a decrease in government affairs expenses 
amortization of intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives  which include acquired technology  acquired pharmacy and customer relationships  trade names  trademarks and website addresses  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
as a result of the streamlining of a legacy software product  we assessed the impairment of an intangible asset in the fourth quarter of and  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the intangible asset 
the impairment charge is included in amortization of intangible assets on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums paid by our members 
carrier partners do not report to us the number of members that we have as of a given date 
the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier and do not inform us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
given the number of months required to observe non payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations  we estimate the number of members who are active on insurance policies as of a specified date 
we estimate the number of continuing members on all policies other than small business insurance policies as of a specific date by taking the sum of i the number of members for whom we have received a commission payment for the month that is six months or three months in the case of medicare  short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation after reducing that number using historical experience for assumed member cancellations over  as applicable  the three month or six month period  and ii the number of approved members over the six month period or three months in the case of medicare  short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of 
table of contents estimation after reducing that number using historical experience for an assumed number of members who do not accept their approved policy and for estimated member cancellations through the date of the estimate 
we estimate the number of small business group members using the number of initial members at the time the group is approved  and we update this number for changes in membership if such changes are reported to us by the group or carrier in the period it is reported 
however  groups generally notify the carrier directly of policy cancellations and increases or decreases in group size without informing us 
additionally  our carrier partners often do not communicate this information to us 
we often are made aware of policy cancellations at the time of annual renewal and update our membership statistics accordingly in the period they are reported 
after we have estimated membership for a period  we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation 
we may receive commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time  or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours 
for instance  we reconcile information carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us  which would cause us to have underestimated our membership 
conversely  carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to policy cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active 
we reflect updated information regarding our membership in the membership estimate for the current period that we are estimating  if applicable 
as a result of the delay in our receipt of information from insurance carriers  actual trends in our membership are most discernable over periods longer than from one quarter to the next 
in addition  and as a result of the delay we experience in receiving information about our membership  it is difficult for us to determine with any certainty the impact of current economic and other conditions on our membership retention 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  but not limited to  estimates for commission forfeitures  the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation  the useful lives of intangible assets  fair value of intangible assets  goodwill  valuation allowance for deferred income taxes and provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and historically consistent 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition commission revenue we recognize revenue for our services when each of the following four criteria is met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue is primarily comprised of compensation paid to us by health insurance carriers related to insurance policies that have been purchased by a member who used our service 
we define a member as an individual currently covered by an insurance plan  including individual  family  medicare related  small business  short term and ancillary plans  for which we are entitled to receive compensation from an insurance carrier 

table of contents commission revenue for individual  family  medicare supplement and small business plans  our compensation generally represents a percentage of the premium amount collected by the carrier during the period that a member maintains coverage under a policy commissions and  to a much lesser extent  override commissions that health insurance carriers pay us for achieving certain objectives 
premium based commissions are reported to us after the premiums are collected by the carrier  generally on a monthly basis 
we generally continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
we recognize commission revenue for individual  family and small business plans as the commissions are reported to us by the carrier  net of an estimate for future forfeiture amounts due to policy cancellations 
we determine that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement when we have a commission agreement with a health insurance carrier  a carrier reports to us that it has approved an application submitted through our ecommerce platform and the applicant starts making payments on the policy 
our services are complete when a carrier has approved an application 
the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured when commission amounts have been reported to us by a carrier 
we recognize individual  family and small business commission override revenue when reported to us by a carrier based on the actual attainment of predetermined target sales levels or other objectives as determined by the carrier 
commission override revenue  which we recognize on the same basis as individual  family and small business commissions  is generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than such commissions 
for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans  we receive a fixed  annual commission payment from insurance carriers once the policy is approved by the carrier and either a fixed  monthly commission payment beginning with and subsequent to the second policy year for a medicare advantage policy or a fixed  annual commission payment beginning with and subsequent to the second policy year for a medicare part d prescription drug policy 
we recognize commission revenue for both medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug plans for the entire policy year once the annual or first monthly commission amount for the policy year is reported to us by the carrier  net of an estimate for future forfeiture amounts due to policy cancellations 
for commissions paid to us on a monthly basis  we will a receivable for the commission amounts to be received over the remainder of the policy year  net of an estimate for commission amounts not expected to be collected due to policy cancellations  which is included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets 
we continue to receive the commission payments from the relevant insurance carrier until the earlier of our being notified that the health insurance policy has been cancelled  our no longer remaining the agent on the policy  or our commission term with the carrier expires  typically up to six years from the effective date of the policy 
we determine that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement when we have a commission agreement with a health insurance carrier 
our services are complete when a carrier has approved an application in the initial year and when a member has renewed in a renewal year 
the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured when a carrier has approved an application and the carrier reports to us the annual or first monthly renewal commission amount for each policy year 
commissions for all health insurance plans we sell are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we generally receive these communications simultaneously 
in instances when we receive the cash payment and commission statement separately and in different accounting periods  we recognize revenue in the period that we receive the earliest communication  provided we receive the second corroborating communication shortly following the end of the accounting period 
if the second corroborating communication is not received shortly following the end of the accounting period  we recognize revenue in the period the second communication is received 
we use the data in the commission statements to help identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate future forfeiture amounts due to policy cancellations 
as a result  we recognize the net amount of compensation earned as the agent in the transaction 
certain commission amounts are subject to forfeiture when the policy is subsequently cancelled and either the carrier takes back all or a portion of the commission they have paid to us or we will no longer receive 
table of contents monthly commissions payments for the remainder of the policy year 
we record an estimate for these forfeitures based on our historical cancellation experience using data provided on commission statements 
policy cancellations and the commission amounts  if any  to be taken back by the carrier are typically reported to us by health insurance carriers several months after the policy s cancellation date 
our estimate for forfeitures payable to a carrier  which is included in other current liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets  includes an estimate of both the reporting time lag and the forfeiture amount  based on our historical experience by policy type 
similarly  our estimate for commission amounts not expected to be collected due to policy cancellations  which is recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets  includes an estimate of the annual policy cancellation rate  based on our historical experience by policy type 
changes in our historical trends would result in changes to our estimated forfeitures in future periods 
there were no changes in our average forfeiture rates or reporting time lag during the years ended december  and which had a material impact on our estimate for forfeitures 
we do not expect our estimated forfeiture rates to materially change in compared to we rely on health insurance carriers to report accurately and in a timely manner the amount of commissions earned by us  and we calculate our commission revenues  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets  and direct our marketing and other operating efforts based on the reports we receive from them 
each month we analyze the reports we receive from health insurance carriers by comparing such data to the database we maintain on our members 
it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not carriers are reporting all commissions due to us  primarily because members on individual  family and small business policies typically terminate their policies by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier instead of by informing us of the cancellation 
also  some of our individual  family and small business members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
this results in our having to identify underpayment or non payment of commissions on a policy and follow up with a carrier to obtain an explanation and or request correction of the amount of commissions paid to us 
other revenue online sponsorship advertising our sponsorship advertising program allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee  which is recognized over the period that advertising is displayed  and often a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
we also offer medicare sponsorship services  which include website development  hosting and maintenance 
in these instances  we are typically paid a fixed  up front fee  which we recognize as revenue over the service period 
technology licensing revenue our commercial technology licensing business allows carriers the use of our ecommerce platform to offer their own health insurance policies on their websites and agents to utilize our technology to power their online quoting  content and application submission processes 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party  and a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
the metrics used to calculate performance fees for both sponsorship advertising and technology licensing are based on performance criteria that are either measured based on data tracked by us  or based on data tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
we began to license our technology to government agency customers and in we were awarded a contract from the federal government to provide technology and information services relating to the federal government s healthcare reform website  which is a multiple element arrangement 
we were not able to establish 
table of contents fair value for each element within the contract and  therefore  accounted for the entire contract as one unit of accounting 
we deferred all revenue related to the contract until our technology was available for use by the federal government 
revenue was recognized on a straight line basis from the date our technology was available for use by the federal government to the end of the initial one year term of the contract in july the term of this contract expired in january medicare lead referral revenue the medicare related revenue we have generated includes referral fees paid to us based on medicare leads generated by our online platforms that are delivered and sold to third parties 
we sell our leads to a limited number of purchasers of our leads  and the majority of our lead referral revenue is generated during the medicare annual enrollment period  which occurs during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
we recognize lead referral revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of a lead has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a lead is delivered to the customer 
deferred revenue deferred revenue consists of deferred technology licensing implementation fees as well as amounts billed or collected from sponsorship or technology licensing customers in advance of our performing our service for such customers 
it also includes the amount by which both unbilled and billed services provided under our federal government contract exceed the straight line revenue recognized to date 
we defer commission amounts that have been paid to us related to transactions where our services are complete  but where we cannot currently estimate future forfeitures related to those amounts 
multiple element arrangements in accordance with accounting standards update asu no 
revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  which was effective for us prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january   we allocate revenue to all units of accounting within an arrangement with multiple deliverables at the inception of the arrangement using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in an arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s relative selling price 
the relative selling price established for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe if available  third party evidence of selling price if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor third party evidence is available 
when used  the best estimate of selling price reflects our best estimates of what the selling prices of certain deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
our process for determining best estimate of selling price for deliverables without vsoe or third party evidence of selling price considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
key factors considered by us in developing the relative selling prices for our technology licensing fees include prices charged by us for similar offerings and our historical pricing practices 
we may also consider additional factors as appropriate  including competition 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact to our results of operations or financial position 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value and there are no customer negotiated right of refunds for the delivered elements 
if the arrangement includes a customer negotiated right of refund relative to the delivered item  and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control  the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting 
in circumstances when the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements  and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is determined for the combined unit as a single unit 
allocation of the consideration is determined at the inception of the arrangement on the basis of each unit s relative selling price 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices  we apply revenue recognition criteria separately to each respective unit of accounting in the arrangement in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based on the fair value of our stock based awards over their respective vesting periods  which is generally four years 
the weighted average expected term for stock options granted during was calculated using historical option exercise behavior 
prior to  the weighted average expected term for stock options granted was calculated using the simplified method  as we did not have sufficient historical option exercise behavior on which to estimate expected terms 
the simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option 
we estimate our expected volatility using a combination of our weighted average implied volatility and our historical volatility 
prior to  we estimated the volatility used as an input to the model based on an analysis of our stock price since our initial public offering in october  as well as an analysis of similar public companies for which we have data 
the dividend yield is determined by dividing the expected per share dividend during the coming year by the grant date stock price 
through december   we had not declared or paid any cash dividends  and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of our stock options 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and volatility related to our own stock based awards on a prospective basis  and incorporating these factors into the model 
changes in key assumptions will significantly impact the valuation of such instruments 
future stock based compensation expense is dependent upon the fair value of each option at the date each option is granted and the number of awards issued and outstanding during each period 
we expect stock based compensation expense will increase in the future to the extent the number of equity awards issued and outstanding increases 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
we do not amortize goodwill but test for impairment on an annual basis on or about november of each year and whenever we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in its fair value below its carrying amount 
intangible assets with finite useful lives  which include purchased technology  pharmacy and customer relationships  trade names  trademarks and website addresses  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends or significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping s carrying value and its fair value 
fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
goodwill and intangible assets are considered non financial assets  and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized 
we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings 
in addition  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of 
table of contents assets with finite useful lives 
when we determine that the useful life of an asset is shorter than we had originally estimated  we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets new  remaining useful life 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
since tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  which gives rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not criteria  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets  as well as discrete tax items during the period  such as excess tax benefits related to share based payments 
assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon several factors  including the likelihood and amount  if any  of future taxable income in relevant jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we forecast taxable income by considering all available positive and negative evidence  including our history of operating income and losses and our financial plans and estimates that we use to manage the business 
these assumptions require significant judgment about future taxable income 
as a result  the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change 
future changes in various factors  such as the amount of stock based compensation we record during the period and the related tax benefit we realize upon the exercise of employee stock options  potential limitations on the use of our federal and state net operating loss credit carry forwards  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from or limitations on our ability to utilize research and development credits  the amount of non deductible lobbying and acquisition related costs  changes in our valuation allowance and state and foreign taxes  would impact our estimates  and as a result  could affect our effective tax rate and the amount of income tax expense we record  and pay  in future periods

operating activities cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income  adjusted for certain non cash items including deferred income taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization and accretion on marketable securities  net  stock based compensation expense  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
the timing of the recognition of our commission revenue depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission reports and associated commission payments from health insurance carriers 
if we were to experience a delay in receiving a commission payment from a health insurance carrier at the end of a quarter  our operating cash flows for that quarter could be adversely impacted 
additionally  commission override payments are reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
for example  a carrier may make a commission override payment to us on an annual basis  which would positively impact our cash flows in the quarter the payment is received 
the majority of our annual commission override payments are typically received during the first quarter of the year 

table of contents historically  we have experienced a reduction in operating cash flows during the first quarter of the year compared to the other quarters due to the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the year 
a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our ecommerce platform 
since our marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and the revenue from approved applications is recognized as commissions are subsequently reported to us  our operating cash flows could be adversely impacted by a substantial increase in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter
