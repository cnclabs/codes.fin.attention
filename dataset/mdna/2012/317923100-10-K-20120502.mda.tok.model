item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as elsewhere in this annual report on form k involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors  many of which may be beyond the company s control 
accordingly  future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statements 
investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
you can identify these statements as those that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or advancements and by forward looking words such as believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  future  forecast  predict  potential  should  intend  plan  project  goal  will  will be  will continue  could  may  might or any variations of such words or other words with similar meanings 
forward looking statements address  among other things  expectations  growth strategies  including plans to open and close stores  projections of future profitability  results of operations  capital expenditures  financial condition or other forward looking information and include statements about net sales  product margin  occupancy costs  selling  general and administrative expenses  operating margins  liquidity  operations and inventory 
the current economic and financial conditions have caused and may continue to cause a decline in consumer spending and may adversely affect the company s business  operations  liquidity  financial results and stock price 
the company s operating results are affected by the relative condition of the us economy 
business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a decline in business and consumer spending  including a reduction in the availability of credit  increased unemployment 
table of contents levels  higher energy and fuel costs  rising interest rates  financial market volatility and recession 
additionally  the company may experience difficulties in operating and growing its operations to react to economic pressures in the us as a business that depends on consumer discretionary spending  our customers may reduce their purchases due to job losses or fear of job losses  foreclosures  bankruptcies  higher consumer debt and interest rates  reduced access to credit  falling home prices and lower consumer confidence 
decreases in comparable store net sales  customer traffic or average dollar per transaction negatively affect the company s financial performance  and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business 
promotional activities and decreased demand for consumer products could affect profitability and margins 
customer traffic is difficult to forecast and mitigate 
as a consequence  sales  operating and financial results for a particular period are difficult to predict  and  therefore  it is difficult to forecast results to be expected in future periods 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition and could adversely affect the company s stock price 
additionally  many of the effects and consequences of us and global financial and economic conditions could potentially have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and capital resources  including the ability to raise additional capital if needed  and the ability of banks to honor draws on the company s credit facility  or could otherwise negatively affect the company s business and financial results 
although the company normally generates funds from operations to pay operating expenses and fund capital expenditures  the ability to continue to meet these cash requirements over the long term may require access to additional sources of funds  including capital and credit markets  and continuing market volatility  the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of the company to access capital and credit markets 
global economic conditions may also adversely affect suppliers access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory  production levels and product quality and to operate their businesses  all of which could adversely affect the company s supply chain 
in addition  suppliers might reduce their offerings of customer incentives and vendor allowances  cooperative marketing expenditures and product promotions 
market instability could make it more difficult for the company and its suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends  which could cause the company to carry too much or too little merchandise in various product categories 
the current financial and economic conditions may also adversely affect landlords and real estate developers of retail space  which may limit the availability of attractive leased store locations 
the current conditions may also adversely affect the company s product liquidation efforts 
the company s business faces a great deal of competitive pressure 
the athletic footwear business is highly competitive 
the company competes for customers  customer service professionals  locations  merchandise  services and other important aspects of its business with many other local  regional  national and branded vendor operated retailers 
those competitors  some of whom have a greater market presence than the company  include traditional store based retailers  internet businesses and other forms of retail commerce 
unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect the company s performance 
the company s business is dependent on consumer preferences and fashion trends 
the athletic footwear and softgood industry is subject to changing fashion trends and customer preferences 
the company cannot guarantee that its merchandise selection will accurately reflect customer preferences when it is offered for sale or that the company will be able to identify and respond quickly to fashion changes  particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of the company s merchandise from vendors 
for example  athletic footwear is ordered four to six months prior to delivery to stores 
if the company fails to 
table of contents anticipate accurately either the market for the merchandise or customers purchasing habits  the company may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess  slow moving inventory  which may adversely affect performance 
a security breach of the company s information technology systems could damage the company s reputation and have an adverse effect on operations and results 
the company accepts electronic payment cards from customers for payment 
the company also receives and maintains certain personal information about customers and employees 
a number of retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen 
while the company has taken significant steps to prevent the occurrence of security breaches in this respect  including complying with the highest level of payment card industry security standards  the company may  in the future  become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the theft of credit or debit card information  and may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents 
any such proceeding could be a distraction to the company and cause significant unplanned losses and expenses 
if the company s security and information systems are compromised or employees fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately  it could adversely affect the company s reputation  as well as results of operations  and could result in litigation  the imposition of penalties  or significant expenditures to remediate any damage to persons whose personal information has been compromised 
various risks associated with digital sales may adversely affect the company s business 
the company sells merchandise over the internet through its website  www 
finishline 
com as well as mobile at m 
finishline 
com and beginning in fiscal through www 
run 
com 
the digital operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
the digital operations also involve other risks that could have an impact on the company s results of operations including hiring  retention and training of personnel to conduct the digital operations  diversion of sales from the stores  rapid technological change  liability for online content  credit card fraud  risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the website and its related support systems  including computer viruses  telecommunication failures and electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
there can be no assurance that the digital operations will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth or even remain at their current level 
the company s operations are dependent on a single distribution center  and the loss of  or disruption in  the distribution center and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
the distribution functions for the company are handled from a single facility in indianapolis  indiana 
any significant interruption in the operation of the distribution facility due to natural disasters  accidents  system failures or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair the ability to distribute merchandise to stores and or fulfill digital orders  which could cause sales to decline 
the company depends upon third party carriers for shipment of a significant amount of merchandise 
an interruption in service by these third party carriers for any reason could cause temporary disruptions in business  a loss of sales and profits  and other material adverse effects 
freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges 
fuel prices and surcharges affect freight costs both on inbound freight from suppliers to the distribution center as well as outbound freight from the distribution center to stores and shipments of product to customers 
increases in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors may increase freight costs 

table of contents the company may experience fluctuations in results of operations due to seasonality of the business 
the company s business is subject to seasonal influences  with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year  which include the back to school and holiday seasons  respectively 
this seasonality causes operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially and adversely affect the company s stock price 
the company s business may be adversely affected by changes in merchandise sourcing 
all of the company s vendors must comply with applicable laws and required standards of conduct 
the ability to find qualified vendors and access products in a timely and efficient manner can be a challenge  especially with respect to goods sourced outside the united states 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to foreign trade  and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms are beyond the company s control and could adversely impact performance 
changes in labor conditions as well as the company s inability to attract and retain the talent required for the business  may negatively affect operating results 
future performance will depend upon the company s ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees  including store personnel and field management 
many of those sales associates are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
the ability to meet the company s labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels  prevailing wage rates  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
if the company is unable to attract and retain quality sales associates  the ability to meet growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised 
in addition  a large number of the company s retail employees are paid the prevailing minimum wage  which if increased would negatively affect profitability and could  if the increase were material  require the company to adjust its business strategy  which may include the closure of less profitable stores 
although none of the company s employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements  the company cannot guarantee that employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future 
if some  or all  of the company s workforce were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from the company s current compensation arrangements or work practices  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in relationships with any of the company s key vendors  may have an adverse impact on future results 
the company s business is dependent to a significant degree upon the ability to purchase premium brand name merchandise at competitive prices  including the receipt of volume discounts  cooperative advertising and markdown allowances from vendors 
the company purchased approximately of its merchandise in fiscal from its top five vendors and expects to continue to obtain a significant percentage of its product from these vendors in future periods 
approximately was purchased from one vendor nike 
the inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers particularly nike as a result of business decisions by suppliers or any disruption in the supply chain could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
because of the strong dependence on nike  any adverse development in nike s financial condition and results of operations or the inability of nike to develop and manufacture products that appeal to the company s target customers could also have an adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the company s business may be adversely affected by regulatory and litigation developments 
various aspects of the company s operations are subject to federal  state or local laws  rules and regulations  any of which may change from time to time 
sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by new legal requirements  including comprehensive federal health care legislation enacted in and 
table of contents attendant regulations 
for example  new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for compliance or indirectly to the extent that such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs 
additionally  the company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of doing business 
litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the business operations and financial performance of the company 
health care reform could adversely affect the company s business 
in  congress enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which  among other things  includes guaranteed coverage requirements  eliminates pre existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits  restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded  and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits 
due to the breadth and complexity of the health reform legislation  the current lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance  and the phased in nature of the implementation  it is difficult to predict the overall effect of the legislation and related regulations on the business over the coming years 
possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs  exposure to expanded liability and requirements for the company to revise ways in which it conducts business 
the company s business may be adversely affected by the failure to identify suitable store locations and acceptable lease terms 
to take advantage of customer traffic and the shopping preferences of customers  the company needs to obtain and retain stores in desirable locations such as in regional and neighborhood malls anchored by major department stores 
the company cannot be certain that desirable mall locations will continue to be available 
several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls in the united states and because of the dependence upon these landlords for a substantial number of the company s locations  any significant erosion of the relationships with these landlords or their financial condition would negatively affect the ability to obtain and retain store locations 
additionally  further landlord consolidation may negatively affect the ability to obtain and retain store locations at acceptable lease terms 
the company s average lease term remaining for all stores is relatively short average remaining term of approximately years 
due to the short term nature  the company is subject to potential market changes  which could increase occupancy costs and adversely affect profitability 
the company s inability to implement its strategic growth initiatives may have an adverse impact on future results 
the company s ability to succeed in its strategic growth initiatives could require significant capital investment and management attention  which may result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities 
additionally  any new initiative is subject to certain risks including customer acceptance  competition  product differentiation  challenges to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including management 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to develop and successfully implement its strategic growth initiatives to a point where they will become profitable  or generate positive cash flow 
if the company cannot successfully execute its strategic growth initiatives  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
a major failure of information systems could adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is dependent on information systems 
in particular  the company relies on information systems to effectively manage sales  distribution  merchandise planning and allocation functions 
the company possesses offsite recovery capabilities for its information systems 
however  the failure of information systems to perform as designed could disrupt the company s business and adversely affect sales and profitability 

table of contents because the company s stock price may be volatile  it could experience substantial declines 
the market price of the company s common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility 
the company s quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets  and other developments affecting the company  its key vendors or competitors  could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies  often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance  and may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
anti takeover provisions under the indiana business corporation law and the company s restated articles of incorporation and bylaws may render more difficult the accomplishment of mergers or the assumption of control by a principal shareholder  making more difficult the removal of management 
certain provisions of the indiana business corporation law the ibcl  specifically the constituent interests provision in section of the ibcl  the control share acquisitions provisions in sections to  the business combination provisions in sections to  and certain provisions of the company s restated articles of incorporation and bylaws  specifically the provisions regarding preferred stock  the provisions requiring a supermajority vote for certain business combinations and for certain amendments to the restated articles of incorporation  the provisions requiring approval of certain transactions by the continuing directors  the provisions for a staggered board and the provisions limiting removal of directors to removal for cause  may have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited attempt by another person or entity to acquire control of the company 
these provisions may make mergers  tender offers  the removal of management  and certain other transactions more difficult or more costly and could discourage or limit shareholder participation in such types of transactions  whether or not such transactions are favored by the majority of the shareholders 
the provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the company s common stock 
further  the existence of these anti takeover measures may cause potential bidders to look elsewhere  rather than initiating acquisition discussions with the company 
any of these factors could reduce the price of the company s common stock 
other factors may negatively affect the company s business 
the foregoing list of risk factors is not exclusive 
other factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect the company 
the company does not undertake to revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made

fiscal outlook based on strategic investments in technology  stores and digital capabilities required to execute the company s omni channel strategy  the company expects to generate earnings per share growth in the mid single digits in fiscal with comparable store net sales expected in the mid single digits as well 
as the investments begin to drive returns  the company expects earnings per share growth to accelerate into the low to mid teens beginning in fiscal critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventories  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the cost associated with acquiring merchandise from vendors  occupancy costs  provision for inventory shortages  and credits and allowances from our merchandise vendors 
cash consideration received from merchandise vendors after the related merchandise has been sold is recorded as an offset to cost of sales in the period negotiations are finalized 
for cash consideration received on merchandise still in inventory  the allowance is recorded as a reduction to the cost of on hand inventory and recorded as a reduction of our cost of sales at the time of sale 
because the company does not include the costs associated with operating its distribution facility and freight within cost of sales  the company s gross profit may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in costs of sales and in the calculation of gross profit 
valuation of inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
the company s valuation of inventory includes markdown adjustments for merchandise that will be sold below cost and the impact of shrinkage 
markdowns are based upon historical information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
shrinkage is based on historical information and assumptions as to current shrink trends 
it is possible that changes to the markdowns and shrinkage estimates could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense for minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the leased space for build out 
contingent rents are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
the company records a contingent rent liability in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition  management is required to evaluate all available evidence including estimating future taxable income by taxing jurisdictions  the future reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and recent results of operations when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for a portion or all of its deferred tax asset 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company s income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a two step approach for evaluating income tax positions 
the first step requires the company to conclude that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by a tax authority 
the second step applies if the company has concluded that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination and requires the company to measure the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis  which it is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company adjusts its accrual for uncertain tax positions and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from its established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
accruals of uncertain tax positions require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates
