business overview we are a publicly traded specialty niche focused commercial insurance underwriter and insurance administration services company 
we market and underwrite specialty property and casualty insurance programs and products on both an admitted and non admitted basis through a broad and diverse network of independent retail agents  wholesalers  program administrators and general agents  who value service  specialized knowledge  and focused expertise 
program business refers to an aggregation of individually underwritten risks that have some unique characteristic and are distributed through a select group of agents 
we seek to combine profitable underwriting  income from our net commissions and fees  investment returns and efficient capital management to deliver consistent long term growth in shareholder value 
through our retail property and casualty agencies  we also generate commission revenue  which represents of our total consolidated revenues 
our agencies are located in michigan  california  and florida and produce commercial  personal lines  life and accident and health insurance that is primarily with unaffiliated insurance carriers 
these agencies produce a minimal amount of business for our affiliated insurance company subsidiaries 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages within the following categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  commission revenue  and net realized gains losses 
we compete in the specialty insurance market 
our wide range of specialty niche insurance expertise allows us to accommodate a diverse distribution network ranging from specialized program agents to retail agents 
in the specialty market  competition tends to place considerable focus on availability  service and other tailored coverages in addition to price 
moreover  our broad geographical footprint enables us to function with a local presence on both a regional and national basis 
we also have the capacity to write specialty insurance in both the admitted and non admitted markets 
these unique aspects of our business model enable us to compete on factors other than price 
critical accounting policies general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies  along with those disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies  are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represents case based estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued  million and  million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
components of losses and loss adjustment expense the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed mfh assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business allocated to individual insurance company writers based on the insurer s market share in a given state 
the reserves referenced in the above table related to our direct and assumed directly managed business are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
likewise assumed mfh is assumed business related to our partial ownership of midwest financial holdings where we have direct access to their paid and case reserve loss data 
accordingly  case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no delay or lag in reporting of losses from a ceding company  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag between the date of the evaluation and the receipt of the estimate from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  and include an estimated reserve determined based upon internal actuarial methods for this lag 
relative to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received from cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total claim reserving process and methodology when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  which focus on the ultimate probable cost of each reported claim  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
in developing claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates  we perform a complete and detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform this analysis  the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it may be a particular geographical area within a line of business such as california workers compensation 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as either short tail or long tail 
about of our reserves can be characterized as coming from long tail lines of business 
for long tail business  several years may lapse between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
our long tail exposures include workers compensation  commercial automobile liability  general liability  professional liability  products liability  aviation liability  excess  and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  a portion of ocean marine  and inland marine 
the analyses generally review losses both gross and net of reinsurance 
the standard actuarial methods that we use to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method incurred development method paid bornhuetter ferguson method reported bornhuetter ferguson method initial expected loss method paid roll forward method incurred roll forward method all of these methods are consistently applied to every reserve category where they are applicable and they create indications for each accident year 
we use judgment selecting the best estimate from within these estimates or adjusted estimates 
as such  no one method or group of methods is strictly used for any line of business or reserve category within a line of business 
the individual selections by year are our best judgments based on the strengths and weaknesses of the method  indications  the inherent variability in the data and the specific modifications to selections for data characteristics 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued a brief description of the methods and some discussion of their inherent strengths  weaknesses and uses are as follows paid development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
incurred development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment and case reserving environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
since the method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 
reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place  and the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on adjusting prior accident year projections to the current accident year levels using underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments specific to the line of business 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued paid roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual paid loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it is useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns 
incurred roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual case incurred loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it may also be useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns and generally reacts faster than the paid roll forward method 
claims for short tail lines of business settle more quickly than long tail lines of business  and in general  loss development factors for short tail lines are smaller than long tail lines 
for long tail lines  we tend to rely on initial expected loss methods throughout the current accident year then move to development factor based methods for older accident years 
development methods on short tail lines are generally reliable in the third and fourth quarter of the initial accident year and recorded loss ratios reflect a blend of the development and forecast methods 
short tail lines represent of our total reserves at december  the reserve categories where the above methods are not applicable are few 
the largest of these is our workers compensation residual market reserve category  where we utilize detailed reserve analyses performed by the industry statistical agency ncci in making our estimates 
we adjust these estimates for timing differences in the reporting of the data 
the other reserve categories that deviate from the above methods are smaller  as a group constituting approximately one percent of the total reserves 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
for all but the initial expected loss method  the key assumptions are the patterns with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time development patterns 
these patterns incorporate inherent assumptions of claims cost inflation rates and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
these are affected by underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments which are explicit key assumptions underlying the initial expected loss method 
each of these key assumptions is discussed in the following paragraphs 
to analyze the development patterns  we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical development patterns 
to the extent that the historical data may provide insufficient information about future patterns whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rating bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our insurance companies historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the reserve for losses and lae at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  the new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop for many years and at times  decades in the future 
when it is likely the actual development will occur in the distant future  the potential for actual development to differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections is increased 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
in particular  the development factor based methods all have as a key assumption that the development of losses in the future will follow a pattern similar to those measured by past experience and as adjusted either explicitly or by actuarial judgment 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple and varied factors 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued variability of claim reserve estimates by its nature  the estimate of ultimate losses and lae is subject to variability due to differences between our assumptions and actual events in the future 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate the values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of the future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analyses to perform the necessary adjustments 
one implicit assumption underlying development patterns is that the claims inflation trends will continue into the future similar to their past patterns 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  our actuarial department derives expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary variance of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
general inflation trends have been fairly stable over the past several years but there have been fluctuations of one to two percent over the past ten years and therefore we used a one percent annual inflation variance factor 
the effect differed by line of business but overall was a four percent change in reserve adequacy or approximately million effect on after tax net income 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
an explicit assumption used in the analysis is the set of initial expected loss ratios ielrs used in the current accident year reserve projections and in some of the prior accident year ultimate loss indications 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss to a change in ielrs  the actuarial department recasted the loss reserve indications using a set of ielrs all one percent higher than the final ielrs 
the overall impact of a one percent change in ielrs would be a corresponding one percent change in reserve adequacy or a million effect on after tax net income 
often the loss ratios by line of business will vary from the ielr in different directions causing them to partially offset each other 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
the other factors having influence upon the loss and lae reserve levels are too numerous and interdependent to efficiently model and test for sensitivity 
likewise  the development factors by reserve category and age are too numerous to model and test for sensitivity 
instead  ranges are estimated by reserve category considering past history  fluctuations in the development patterns  emerging issues  trends and other factors 
the ranges are compiled and the total range is estimated considering the sensitivity to all of the underlying factors together 
the resulting range is our best estimate of the expected ongoing variability in the loss reserves 
our range of loss and lae reserves table shows that presently we estimate them as going from favorable development of to unfavorable of 
the range was evaluated based on the ultimate loss estimates from the actuarial methods described above

management s discussion and analysis continued pre tax impact on earnings from a variance in future loss payments and case reserves as of december  in thousands line of business minimum reserve range maximum reserve range workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total the sensitivity around our workers compensation reserves primarily reflects the size and the maturity of the underlying book of business 
our workers compensation reserves represent of our total reserves at december  the sensitivity around our commercial multiple peril general liability reserves primarily reflects the longer duration of reserves relating to our liability excess program  which started in  and construction defect exposure  which together represent approximately of the million reserves in this line of business as of december  these lines of business are subject to greater uncertainty than the remainder of our book of business 
the sensitivity around our commercial automobile reserves primarily reflects the speed of reporting of the underlying losses  as well as the maturity of the case law surrounding automobile liability 
the sensitivity around the other lines of business primarily reflects the size of the underlying book of business 
our other reserves represent of total reserves at december  a large portion of these reserves represent professional liability programs which tend to be claims made and reinsured at lower limits  therefore reducing the volatility that is inherent in a smaller book of business 
another large portion represents property claims  which have a shorter reporting and payout pattern than liability and workers compensation claims 
all of our reserves are sensitive to changes in the underlying claim payment and case reserving practices  as well as the other sources of variations mentioned above 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which may be in dispute 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by the policy at issue  errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
in accordance with accounting guidance  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  an accrual is provided for the costs to resolve these claims in our consolidated accompanying financial statements 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
non gaap financial measures net operating income and net operating income per share net operating income and net operating income per share are non gaap measures that represent net income excluding net realized gains or loss  net of tax 
the most directly comparable financial gaap measures to net operating income and net operating income per share are net income and net income per share 
net operating income and net operating income per share are intended as supplemental information and are not meant to replace net income nor net income per share 
net operating income and net operating income per share should be read in conjunction with the gaap financial results

we believe these measures provide investors with valuable information relating to our ongoing performance that may be obscured by the net effect of realized gains and losses as a result of our market risk sensitive instruments  which primarily relate to fixed income securities that are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
realized gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by external economic developments  such as capital market conditions 
accordingly  net operating income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from our ongoing business operations and the underlying profitability of our business 
therefore  we believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate net operating income and net operating income per share  along with net income and net income per share when reviewing and evaluating our performance

management s discussion and analysis continued accident year loss ratio the accident year loss ratio is a non gaap measure and represents our net loss and lae ratio adjusted for any adverse or favorable development on prior year reserves 
the most directly comparable financial gaap measure to the accident year loss ratio is the net loss and lae ratio 
the accident year loss ratio is intended as supplemental information and is not meant to replace the net loss and lae ratio 
the accident year loss ratio should be read in conjunction with the gaap financial results 
the following is a reconciliation of the accident year loss ratio to the net loss and lae ratio  which is the most directly comparable gaap measure for the years ended december  accident year loss ratio adverse favorable development on prior years net loss lae ratio we use the accident year loss ratio as one component to assess our current year performance and as a measure to evaluate  and if necessary  adjust our pricing and underwriting 
our net loss and lae ratio is based on calendar year information 
adjusting this ratio to an accident year loss ratio allows us to evaluate information based on the current year activity 
we believe this measure provides investors with valuable information for comparison to historical trends and current industry estimates 
we also believe that it is useful for investors to evaluate the accident year loss ratio and net loss and lae ratio separately when reviewing and evaluating our performance 
results of operations executive overview our results for the year ended december   include the positive impact from continued selective growth  coupled with our adherence to strict corporate underwriting guidelines and a focus on current accident year price adequacy 
our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to in our accident year combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to in the year to date results were impacted by higher than expected or normal level storm losses that occurred during  which added percentage points to both the gaap and accident year combined ratios

excluding the impact of the conversion of the existing fee based program  gross written premium increased million  or as compared to the prior year 
this increase primarily reflects the maturation of existing programs  rate increases that have been achieved and new business initiatives that were implemented during the past twelve months designed to develop specialty niche expertise in a range of areas 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in certain programs where pricing or underwriting did not meet the company s targets

management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in as previously discussed  this decrease was primarily driven by the conversion of an existing fee based program into an insured program where we earn premium revenue as opposed to fees revenue 
commission revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects michigan agency business that was added in the current year 
net realized gains increased by million  to a million gain for the year ended december   from a million gain for the comparable period in the increase in realized gains relates to our efforts to generate capital gains as a result of our tax strategy to utilize the benefit from our capital tax loss carry forward

this transaction had no impact on the combined ratio or underwriting income  but did result in a percentage point increase during the year on our loss and lae ratio and a corresponding percentage point decrease on the expense ratio 
net loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the accident year loss and lae ratio was for the both years ended december  and the accident year loss and lae ratio includes percentage points of higher than an expected or normal level of storm loss activity 
the higher than normal level of storm losses was partially offset by improved underwriting results as rate increases and underwriting actions begin to take effect 
excluding the higher than normal level of storm activity the accident year loss and lae ratio improved to  compared to in the prior year 
additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our expense ratio decreased one percentage point to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this improvement reflects a reduction in variable compensation and a reduction in commission rates due to mix of business 
general  selling and administrative costs increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase relates primarily to investments in new sales initiatives to stimulate net commission and fee revenue growth  as well as a shift in certain overhead expenses from direct insurance operations to corporate overhead 
these items were partially offset by a reduction in performance based variable compensation in as compared to general corporate expenses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease is due to a reduction in the performance based variable compensation accrual in the current year  as compared to accruing a provision for variable compensation in interest expense for the year ended december   decreased million  to million  from million for the comparable period in interest expense is primarily attributable to our debentures  which are described within the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis  as well as our term loan 
the overall decrease reflects the decline in the average outstanding balance on our term loan to million for the period ended december  from million for same period in federal income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  or of income before taxes  compared to million  or of income before taxes for the same period in income tax expense on net capital gains and the change in our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the tax impact of net capital gains and the change in or valuation allowance  the effective income tax rate would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lower rate reflects a larger portion of taxable income coming from net investment income rather than fee based and underwriting income  which includes a portion of tax exempt investments

management s discussion and analysis continued results of operations compared to net income for the year ended december   was million  or per dilutive share  compared to net income of million  or per dilutive share  for the comparable period of net operating income  a non gaap measure  increased million  or  to million  compared to net operating income of million in  this equates to an increase in operating income per share of to per dilutive share  compared to per dilutive share in  on lower weighted average shares outstanding 
total weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december   were  compared to  for the comparable period in this decrease reflects the impact of our share repurchase plan the plan in which we repurchased million shares during we currently have approximately million more shares within the plan authorized for repurchase 
revenues compared to revenues for the year ended december   increased million  or  to million  from million for the comparable period in this increase primarily reflects overall growth within our existing programs and new business that was implemented in and the following table sets forth the components of revenues in thousands for the years ended december  revenue net earned premiums management administrative fees claims fees commission revenue net investment income net realized gains losses total revenue net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase was primarily the result of growth within our existing programs and the new business we began writing in management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily reflects the impact of a program we previously managed that decided to perform its own policy administration services  the conversion of an existing program into an insured program within the company s underwriting subsidiary during  as well as a decrease in fees for self insured programs  caused by a decrease in premium volume from continued competition  economic conditions  and higher unemployment 
claim fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease is primarily due to the previously mentioned program above is now administering their claims in house and an anticipated decrease resulting from the termination of one unprofitable program 
net investment income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in this increase primarily reflects the increase in average invested assets from billion in to billion in the increase in our average investment balance is because of growth in underwriting profits  growth in investment income  and a slight lengthening of our loss and lae reserve duration 
the average investment yield for december  was compared to in the current pre tax book yield was compared to in the current after tax book yield was compared to in the effective duration of the investment portfolio was years at december  and years at december  net realized gains losses improved by million  to a million gain for the year ended december   from a million loss for the comparable period in the loss in reflected both the realized losses on the sale of securities sold during the prior year and other than temporary impairments pertaining to certain corporate bonds  asset backed and mortgage backed securities  compared to the realized gains on the sale of securities sold in meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued expenses compared to in  we completed an in depth cost allocation study and made refinements to our process to track these costs on a functional basis 
the purpose of the study was to align our internal expenses with those activities for which individuals perform  such as claims administration or otherwise referred to as unallocated loss adjustment expense  underwriting and related policy administration  or general  selling and administrative costs associated with the production and management of our net commission  fee revenue  and general corporate expenses 
upon completion of the study  we have the information to better define our inter company fees and to treat these fees as an inter company cost reimbursement for financial reporting purposes 
this enabled us to align the consolidated results with the underlying nature or function of internal expenses in the current year 
previously  we used estimations based on an overall cost study that focused on inter company fees in total and the reasonableness of the split between claims administration and policy acquisition costs 
furthermore  during the first quarter of  we made certain reclassifications to the expense classifications on the consolidated statement of income 
these reclassifications were made to enable the user of the financial statements to calculate the gaap combined ratio directly from the consolidated statement of income 
as a result  the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december   has been reclassified to conform to this revised presentation  see note summary of significant accounting policies for reclassification table 
these reclassifications do not change total expenses or consolidated net income as originally reported for the year ended december  please refer to form k filed on may  for further detail 
for the year ended december   this refinement resulted in a percentage point increase in the expense ratio  a percentage point decrease in the loss and lae ratio and a decrease of million in general  selling and administrative costs 
expenses increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase is reflective of the growth in our underwriting operations 
the following table sets forth the components of expenses in thousands for the years ended december  expense net losses and loss adjustment expenses policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses general selling administrative expenses general corporate expenses amortization expense interest expense total expenses net loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the accident year loss and lae ratio was for the year ended december  down from in the comparable period in additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our expense ratio increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this increase reflects the reclassification impact described above as well as an increase in external cost  primarily net commission expense  relating to new business added in the second half of for which the agent performs certain policy issuance functions 
general  selling and administrative costs decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this decrease reflects the reclassification impact described above as well as our ability to further leverage fixed costs

management s discussion and analysis continued general corporate expenses decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease is driven primarily by certain non recurring legal expenses that were incurred in amortization expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this decrease reflects a decrease in the amortization relating to the ussu acquisition completed in interest expense for the year ended december   decreased million  to million  from million for the comparable period in interest expense is primarily attributable to our debentures  which are described within the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis  as well as our term loan 
the overall decrease reflects the decline in the average outstanding balance on our term loan to million for the period ended december  from million for same period in the decrease also reflects interest rate swaps that were entered into during the current year that replaced expiring swaps and had a lower fixed interest rate 
federal income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  or of income before taxes  compared to million  or of income before taxes for the same period in income tax expense on capital gains losses and the change in our valuation allowance for other than temporary impairments and loss carryforwards from prior years where there are not any realized gains to offset the realized capital losses  was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the tax impact of realized gains losses  the effective income tax rate would have been and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the current year rate increase reflects a  adjustment to our current tax expense relating to a return to provision analysis completed on the closing tax return of procentury 
excluding this adjustment  the effective tax rate on net operating income  a non gaap measure  for the year ended december  would have been compared to for the same period in the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily due to a shift in new purchases in our investment portfolio away from tax exempt municipal bonds 
tax exempt income as a percentage of total taxable income has therefore declined  resulting in an increased effective tax rate 
other items results of operations equity earnings of affiliated  net of tax in july  our subsidiary  star  purchased a ownership interest in an affiliate  mfh  for million in cash

management s discussion and analysis continued reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands line of business minimum reserve range maximum reserve range selected reserves workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves reserves are reviewed and established by our internal actuaries for adequacy and peer reviewed by our third party actuaries 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the twelve months ended december   and the year ended december  for the twelve months ended december   we reported an increase in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of beginning net loss and lae reserves at december  the change in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our reserves during and for the twelve months ended december  the major components of this change in ultimates are as follows in thousands meadowbrook insurance group  inc

this net overall increase reflects increases of million  million  and million for accident years   and  respectively 
this increase in the net ultimate loss estimate for these accident years was due to greater than expected claim emergence 
the and accident years emergence was from two countrywide programs  a new england program  three california programs  and a nevada program 
accident year emergence came from a single claim reserve increase 
these increases were partially offset by decreases of million  million   and  for accident years    and respectively 
the decrease in the net ultimate loss estimates for these accident years was due to less than expected claim emergence in two countrywide programs and a florida program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial multiple peril general liability the commercial multiple peril line and general liability line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates of million  or of net commercial multiple peril and general liability reserves 
the net decrease reflects decreases of million  million   million   and  in the ultimate loss estimates for accident years      and respectively 
the decreases in the net ultimate loss estimates for these accident years were due to better than expected claim emergence in several general liability programs and an excess liability program 
the decreases were offset by increases of  million  million    and  for accident years      and  respectively 
these increases in the net ultimate loss estimates for these accident years was due to greater than expected claim emergence in an excess liability program and a contractors program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant

management s discussion and analysis continued commercial automobile the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the commercial automobile line of business increased million  or of net commercial automobile reserves 
this net overall increase reflects increases in the net ultimate loss estimate of million  million and  for accident years   and  respectively 
this increase in the net ultimate loss estimates for this accident year was due to greater than expected claim emergence in a garage program  a california program  an excess program  and a transportation program 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of  for accident year the decrease in the net ultimate loss estimates for this accident year was due to less than expected claim emergence spread across several programs 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
other the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the other lines of business decreased  or of net reserves 
this net decrease reflects decreases of   and  in accident years   and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to better than expected case reserve development during the calendar year in two professional liability programs and a general liability program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
residual markets the workers compensation residual market line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimate of million  or of net reserves 
this decrease reflects a reduction of million in accident year we record loss reserves as reported by the national council on compensation insurance ncci  plus a provision for the reserves incurred but not yet analyzed and reported to us due to a two quarter lag in reporting 
these changes reflect a difference between our estimate of the lag incurred but not reported and the amounts reported by the ncci in the year 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
other than temporary impairments otti refer to note investments of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information specific to otti and their fair value and amount of unrealized losses segregated by the time period the investment has been in an unrealized loss position 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets from our insurance company subsidiaries  and risk management fees and agency commissions from our non regulated subsidiaries 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  other operating expenses  shareholder dividends  share repurchases  capital expenditures  and debt service 
a significant portion of our consolidated assets represents assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that may not be transferable to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances in accordance with state insurance laws 
these laws generally specify that dividends can be paid only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or of the statutory net income for the prior year  less any dividends paid in the prior twelve months 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend available to be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries during is million without prior regulatory approval 
of this million  ordinary dividends of million have been declared and paid as of december  in addition to ordinary dividends  the insurance company subsidiaries have the capacity to pay million of extraordinary dividends in  subject to prior regulatory approval 
the insurance company subsidiaries ability to pay future dividends without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon the insurance company subsidiaries generating net income 
total ordinary dividends paid from our insurance company subsidiaries to our holding company were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we remain well within our targets as they relate to our premium leverage ratios  even taking into consideration the dividends paid by our insurance company subsidiaries 
our targeted maximum leverage ratios for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as of december   on a trailing twelve month statutory consolidated basis  the gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively

management s discussion and analysis continued we also generate operating cash flow from non regulated subsidiaries in the form of commission revenue  outside management fees  and intercompany management fees 
these sources of income are used to meet debt service  shareholders dividends  and other operating expenses of the holding company and non regulated subsidiaries 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization from non regulated subsidiaries were approximately million for the year ended december  we have a total revolving credit facility of million  which may include up to million in letters of credit 
as of december   we had million outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and million in letters of credit issued 
the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital and for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to  surplus contributions to our insurance company subsidiaries to support premium growth or strategic acquisitions 
cash flows provided by operations were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operations is driven primarily by a decrease in cash provided by underwriting activities due to the lag on losses paid relating to the growth in premiums from to the reduction in cash provided from underwriting was offset by increases in cash provided from net investment income  net commissions and fees  and the timing of taxes paid 
we maintain a strong balance sheet with geographic spread of risks  high quality reinsurance  and a high quality investment portfolio 
other items liquidity and capital resources interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on our existing debt obligations 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges 
these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years  to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively

management s discussion and analysis continued variable compensation our variable compensation plans have been established as an incentive for performance of our management team  consist of an annual bonus plan bonus plan and a long term incentive plan ltip 
the bonus plan is a discretionary cash bonus plan premised upon a targeted growth in net after tax earnings on a year over year basis 
each year  the compensation committee and our board of directors establish a new target based upon prior year performance and the forecasted performance levels anticipated for the following year 
the amount of the bonus pool is established by aggregating the individual targets for each participant  which is a percentage of salary 
an employee s actual bonus may be plus or minus his or her target based upon the company and individual s performance at the end of the year  the compensation committee and the board of directors review our performance in relation to performance targets and then establish the total bonus pool to be utilized to pay cash bonuses to the management team based upon overall corporate and individual participant goals 
the ltip is intended to provide an incentive to management to improve our performance over a three year period  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the ltip is not discretionary and is based upon a target for an average three year return on beginning equity 
if the targets are met and all other terms and conditions are satisfied  the ltip awards are paid 
the ltip is paid in cash and in stock 
a participant s percentage is established by the compensation committee and the board of directors in advance of any new three year ltip award 
the stock component of the ltip is paid based upon the closing stock price at the beginning of the three year ltip performance period  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ltip 
our compensation committee also is authorized to issue restricted stock awards when the company achieves various financial  operational and strategic goals and objectives 
with the procentury merger our compensation committee and board of directors determined that our opportunity for successfully integrating the procentury merger would be heightened and shareholder value increased  if all participants were in the same equity based plan beginning in as a result  our compensation committee approved the termination of our current ltip effective december  and established a new plan for based on new performance targets 
based on this amendment  the ltip participants would receive their award based on a two year performance period  rather than a three year period 
therefore  the total award would be approximately two thirds of the original three year award 
there were no accounting adjustments as a result of the amendment as there were no changes to the underlying plan  only an adjustment to the performance period 
all of our plans are administered by the compensation committee of the board of directors and all awards are reviewed and approved by the board of directors at both inception and at distribution 
refer to note variable compensation for additional information relating to our variable compensation 
regulatory and rating issues the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
at december   each of our insurance company subsidiaries was in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required

management s discussion and analysis continued insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg  premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
our targeted maximum leverage ratios for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  the gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios  at an individual company  generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons are set forth below ratio usual range value company star adjusted liabilities to liquid assets under gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under company savers gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under company williamsburg adjusted liabilities to liquid assets under gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under adjusted liabilities to liquid assets on star and williamsburg are outside the usual range primarily as a result of our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
the adjusted liabilities include the gross amount of reinsurance payables related to the pool and does not allow an offset to those payables for any reinsurance recoverables related to the pool 
in addition  the reinsurance recoverables are not included in the liquid assets portion of the formula 
this causes the ratio results to appear much higher due to the timing of the settlement of the pool balances 
pool balances between the entities are settled in the month following the completion of the pooling 
once the balances are settled  the ratio will be and respectively  which is within the usual range 
the gross agents balances to policyholders surplus on star  savers and williamsburg were impacted by our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
the assumed premium receivable increased as a result of growth in business  thereby increasing the gross agents balances related to the pooling agreement 
excluding the intercompany pooling  this ratio would have been within the usual range for for all companies 
reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on both a specific program and line of business basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in regard to our excess of loss reinsurance  we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective or existing reinsurers 
we generally do not seek collateral where the reinsurer is rated a or better by a

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates as well as other relevant market rate or price changes 
the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk 
the following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are primarily related to fixed income securities  which are available for sale and not held for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is managed within the context of an asset and liability management strategy where the target duration for the fixed income portfolio is based on the estimate of the liability duration and takes into consideration our surplus 
the investment policy guidelines provide for a fixed income portfolio duration of between three and a half and five and a half years 
at december   our fixed income portfolio had an effective duration of  compared to at december at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was billion 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is primarily interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is related to our investments in relatively small positions of preferred stocks and mutual funds with an emphasis on dividend income 
these investments comprise of our investment portfolio 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
we continue to purchase tax exempt securities based on our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use a hypothetical change to measure our potential loss in fair value of debt securities assuming an upward and downward parallel shift in interest rates 
the table below presents our model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps fair value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material change in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  our term loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on our term loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had an outstanding balance on our term loan of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  at december   we had an outstanding balance on our term loan of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on our existing debt obligations 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges 
these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
refer to note derivative instruments for further detail relating to our interest rate swap transactions 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had million outstanding on this revolving line of credit 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would have changed interest expense by  at december   we had a zero outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit 
additionally  at december  and  million in letters of credit had been issued
