item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization walter energy  inc walter is a leading producer and exporter of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry from underground and surface mines located in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
walter also produces thermal coal  anthracite coal  metallurgical coke and coal bed methane gas 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on april  we completed the acquisition of western coal corp 
western coal 
the accompanying summary of operating results includes the results of operations of western coal since april  as a result of the western coal acquisition and the change in how our chief operating decision maker evaluates the business operations  beginning with the second quarter of we have revised our reportable segments by arranging them geographically 
we now report all of our operations located in the us in the us operations segment which includes our previous operating segments of underground mining  surface mining and walter coke 
the us operations segment also includes the west virginia mining operations acquired through the acquisition of western coal 
we report our mining operations acquired through the western coal acquisition located in northeast british columbia canada and south wales united kingdom in the canadian and uk operations segment 
previously reported segment amounts have been restated to conform to the current period presentation 
previously reported ton and per ton statistics have been restated to metric tons from short tons for all periods presented 
in december  we announced the closure of our homebuilding segment and on april   we spun off our financing segment  creating walter investment management corp  a publicly traded real estate investment trust 
as a result of the closure and spin off  those segments are presented as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
unless otherwise noted  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our continuing operations only 
executive discussion in we achieved record revenues  ebitda and metallurgical coal sales largely due to the acquisition of western coal and strong pricing through much of the year for hard coking coal 
our key accomplishments in include on april  we completed the acquisition of western coal for a total purchase price of approximately billion 
western coal is a producer of high quality metallurgical coal from mines in northeast british columbia canada  high quality metallurgical coal and compliant thermal coal from mines located in west virginia united states  and high quality anthracite coal in south wales united kingdom 
the acquisition of western coal transformed the company into the leading  publicly traded pure play metallurgical coal producer in the world with strategic access to high growth steel producing countries in asia  south america and europe 
we have significant reserves available for future production  the majority of which is high demand metallurgical coal  with a diverse geographical footprint 
on may  we acquired mineral rights for approximately million metric tons of recoverable blue creek metallurgical coal reserves to the northwest of our existing alabama mines from a subsidiary of chevron corporation 
the transaction captured an integral portion of the last remaining block of blue creek metallurgical coal and paves the way for a strategic opportunity to assemble approximately million metric tons of high quality hard coking coal and the development of a new underground mine 
in addition  we acquired chevron 
table of contents corporation s existing north river thermal coal mine in fayette and tuscaloosa counties of alabama 
within our canadian and uk operations segment  our falling creek connector road project was substantially commissioned near the end of the third quarter and truck hauling volumes on the road have continued to increase into the first quarter 
the falling creek connector road connects the brule mine to the willow creek mine where brule s coal is processed and loaded at the rail load out facility 
the new connector road reduces the hauling distance as compared to the previous route from just over miles down to miles 
it is anticipated that we will be able to increase our payload capacity resulting in lower transportation costs 
our canadian operations continued to implement expansion plans and initiatives designed to increase production  optimize equipment and move from contract to owner operated mines at two of the mines  one in and the other in industry overview and outlook global steel production reached a record billion metric tons in  an increase of from the previous record of billion metric tons set in  including in countries in our key markets of asia  south america and europe 
all major steel producing countries showed growth in annual steel production for asia was million metric tons  an increase of compared to the share of global steel production by countries in asia  south america and europe increased slightly in to from in steel production in south america experienced significant gains  up for the year  while steel production in europe showed a modest gain of compared to coking coal prices have softened somewhat as we have entered into  with spot prices slightly below the first quarter benchmark price of per metric ton 
prices have been recently constrained by contracting chinese and emerging market growth  continued monetary issues in europe  and slow growth in both the us and european economies 
however  the long term demand for metallurgical coal within all our geographic markets is anticipated to remain strong as industry projections continue to suggest that global steelmaking will continue to require increasing amounts of high quality metallurgical coal 
if necessary  we will leverage the opportunity to potentially increase coal inventory to working levels which could help both quality and profitability as it may provide better opportunities for blending as well as lower demurrage costs 
we are focused on the long term contractual market and anticipate continued strong demand for the high quality metallurgical coals we produce 
for we remain well positioned to achieve record metallurgical coal production and currently expect metallurgical coal production to be within the range of million and million metric tons of which approximately will be hard coking coal and will be low volatile pci coal 
we expect more than one third of the growth in production to come from our alabama underground mine no 
after having experienced slow cutting rates for the majority of  just under one third of the growth in production is expected to come from our other us mining operations in alabama and west virginia  and one third of the growth is anticipated to come from increased production at our canadian operations 

table of contents the strong market environment influences walter s investment considerations and is the primary driver for our growth prospects our coking coal product is among the highest quality in the world 
our low volatile pci coals possess the chemical and physical characteristics  including high coke strength and good fluidity  which steel producers prefer 
we believe that demand for high quality  metallurgical coals  will continue to increase and that these raw materials will continue to grow in scarcity  particularly for the highest grade coals  such as ours

us operations hard coking coal sales totaled million metric tons in  a decrease as compared to million metric tons during due to lower production volumes 
the average selling price in was per metric ton  a increase as compared to an average selling price of per metric ton in hard coking coal production totaled million metric tons in  a decline of  metric tons as compared to as lower production in alabama due to difficult geology more than offset the addition of hard coking coal production from the west virginia operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold million metric tons of hard coking coal at an average selling price of per metric ton as compared to million metric tons at an average selling price of per metric ton during the same period in fourth quarter sales volumes were negatively impacted by production shortfalls at our alabama operations as a result of equipment issues on the second longwall at mine no 
and ventilation issues associated with the startup of the nearby third longwall 
the third longwall is currently scheduled to replace the existing second longwall during the second quarter of partially offsetting the decline were sales from inventory and purchased coal 
pricing for premium coking coal produced by our alabama operations for the first quarter of is expected to average approximately per metric ton fob port  which includes a mix of carryover tons at per metric ton as well as new contract tons for the first quarter averaging at the per metric ton benchmark price 
thermal coal sales totaled million metric tons in as compared to million metric tons during the increase was primarily due to sales of the recently acquired west virginia and north river mining operations 
the average selling price in was per metric ton  
table of contents down from the average selling price of per metric ton in lower average pricing was the result of lower prices for tons sold by the north river mine 
thermal coal production totaled million metric tons in  as compared to million metric tons in the increase was due to the addition of the west virginia and north river mining operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold million metric tons of thermal coal  at an average selling price of per metric ton 
canadian and uk operations the canadian and uk operations segment was acquired during the second quarter of as part of the western coal acquisition and therefore there are no comparable results from the prior year and we have therefore limited our historic discussion to factors impacting the second  third and fourth quarters of we experienced production delays during the second and third quarters of which were caused by the effects of adverse weather conditions experienced during the second quarter of in addition  during we experienced delays in the commissioning of the falling creek connector road and delays in the issuance of mining permits 
these delays adversely impacted sales and production volumes as well as transportation costs 
while production volumes remained relatively flat during the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter  we experienced sales volume increases as conditions improved and we anticipate further improvement in metallurgical coal sales from the canadian and uk operations since the april  date of acquisition totaled million metric tons of hard coking coal at an average selling price of per metric ton and million metric tons of low volatile pci coal at an average selling price of per metric ton 
metallurgical coal sales in the fourth quarter of totaled  metric tons of hard coking coal at an average selling price of per metric ton and  metric tons of low volatile pci coal at an average selling price of per metric ton 
we have seen some weakness in the market and anticipate prices to be somewhat lower than those of the canadian and uk operations segment produced a total of million metric tons of hard coking coal and million metric tons of low volatile pci coal since the april  date of acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of the canadian and uk operations segment produced  metric tons of hard coking coal as compared to  metric tons of hard coking coal during the third quarter of low volatile pci coal production during the fourth quarter of from the canadian and uk operations segment totaled  metric tons as compared to production of  metric tons during the third quarter of in december  operations of the ridley terminal used by our canadian mines was affected by the commissioning of an upgraded rail car dumping system  which is the first stage towards a doubling of the annual capacity of the terminal to million metric tons 
the commissioning prevented the unloading of rail cars 
however  this did not delay any scheduled shipments of the fourth quarter 
project work at our willow creek mine coal handling and preparation plant upgrades were coordinated with the coal terminal upgrade  where possible  to minimize our downtime and advance the project completion date 
the coal handling and preparation plant upgrades were executed in two phases with the last phase completed in the first quarter of in  our canadian mines are continuing with expansion plans and initiatives designed to improve our long term production  optimize equipment and decrease costs 
the current and prior year results also included the effect of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 

table of contents segment analysis us operations our us operations segment reported revenues of billion in  an increase of million from the increase in revenues was primarily due to the addition of the west virginia and north river mining operations acquired in the second quarter of which added million in revenues to the segment  however at lower gross margins than those of the legacy operations 
increased revenues were also due to higher average selling prices for hard coking coal  partially offset by lower hard coking coal sales volumes 
the lower hard coking coal sales volumes in as compared to reflects lower production at our alabama underground mines due to geology issues during and weather related issues in the second quarter of statistics for us operations are presented in the following table for the year ended december  average hard coking coal selling price per metric ton tons of hard coking coal sold in thousands average thermal coal selling price per metric ton tons of thermal coal sold in thousands includes sales of both coal produced and purchased coal 
us operations reported operating income of million in  as compared to million in the million decrease in operating income was primarily due to the increase in cost of sales  a higher mix of lower margin thermal coal sales  and increased depreciation and depletion and selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the recently acquired north river and west virginia operations 
cost of sales increased as a result of increased production costs at our alabama underground operations primarily due to difficult geological conditions and higher thermal coal sales volumes as well as higher royalty and freight costs 
canadian and uk operations results for represent the results of the segment since the april  date of acquisition 
the segment reported revenues of million and operating income of million 
results for were adversely impacted by challenging weather conditions during the second quarter and their lingering effects during the third quarter  delays in the issuance of mining permits at the willow creek mine  delays in the commissioning of the falling creek connector road and higher mining ratios at our northeast british columbia mining operations 
these conditions and delays impacted sales and production volumes during the year as well as production and transportation costs 
cost of sales during the fourth quarter for hard coking coal was negatively impacted by purchased coal related to the ridley terminal upgrade 
fourth quarter cost of sales for pci coal was also negatively impacted by our expediting the migration from a contractor base to owner base for our willow creek mine workers 
although this move will help lower overall future costs  it caused some short term 
table of contents increases as we prepared for the move 
statistics for canadian and uk operations are presented in the following table for the year ended december  average hard coking coal selling price per metric ton tons of hard coking coal sold in thousands average low volatile pci coal selling price per metric ton tons of low volatile pci coal sold in thousands average thermal coal selling price per metric ton tons of thermal coal sold in thousands includes sales of both coal produced and purchased coal

cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased million to million in as compared to  primarily as a result of increased volumes in all our operations along with higher freight and royalty costs at our underground mining operations  higher production costs at our surface mining operations  and higher raw material costs at our coke plant 
cost of sales represented of sales in versus of this reduction of cost of sales as a percentage of sales is primarily the result of increased selling prices 
depreciation and depletion expense in increased million as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher depreciation and depletion resulting from a change to the unit of production method of depletion on certain gas properties  as well as depreciation and depletion related to the acquisition of highmount exploration and production alabama  llc highmount and from capital expenditures to develop our mine no 
east longwall operation 
selling  general administrative expenses increased million  or  from primarily attributable to costs associated with the pending acquisition of western coal  acquisition and integration costs associated with the purchase of highmount  costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters and increases in employee compensation and benefit related expenses

additionally  the impact of percentage depletion resulted in a significantly larger favorable impact on the full year effective tax rate in compared to the effective tax rate 
the and results also include the impact of the factors discussed in the following segment analysis 
segment analysis us operations our us operations segment reported revenues of approximately billion for  an increase of million from the same period in the increase in revenues was primarily due to significantly higher average selling prices and higher volumes of hard coking coal and metallurgical coke sales during as compared to as shown in the table below for the year ended december  average hard coking coal selling price per metric ton tons of hard coking coal sold in thousands average thermal coal selling price per metric ton tons of thermal coal sold in thousands metallurgical coke average selling price per metric ton tons of metallurgical coke sold in thousands billion cubic feet of natural gas sold number of producing natural gas wells includes sales of both hard coking coal produced and purchased coal 
includes  wells associated with the acquisition of highmount in the us operations segment reported operating income of million in as compared to million in the million increase in operating income was almost entirely due to the increase in revenue as noted above  partially offset by higher cost of sales and depreciation and depletion 
cost of sales  exclusive of depreciation and depletion  increased as a result of higher sales volumes and higher freight and royalty costs 
depreciation and depletion increased as a result of implementing the unit of production method of accounting for depletion of certain gas properties during  as well as depreciation and depletion related to the highmount acquisition and the mine no 
east mine expansion 
financial condition cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to at december  from million at december   primarily resulting from the use of cash during for capital expenditures of million  million used in january to acquire approximately million common shares of western coal  million of principal payments on our term 
table of contents loans  and dividends paid of million 
offsetting these uses of cash was million in cash flows provided by operating activities during see additional discussion in the statement of cash flows section that follows 
net receivables and inventories increased by million and million at december  as compared to december   respectively  primarily due to the acquisition of western coal and the north river mine during the second quarter of see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details around these acquisitions 
net mineral interests were billion at december  as compared to million at december  the increase was due to the acquisition of western coal 
net property  plant and equipment was billion at december  an increase of million from december   primarily due to additions of million as a result of the western coal acquisition and capital expenditures during of million  partially offset by depreciation expense 
accrued expenses and accounts payable were million and million at december   an increase of million and million from december   respectively  primarily due to the acquisitions of western coal and the north river mine 
deferred income tax liabilities were billion at december  primarily due to the acquisition of western coal 
the long term portion of the accumulated postretirement benefits obligation was million at december   up million from million at december  the increase was primarily attributed to a decrease in the discount rate  an increase in health care cost trend rates and revised mortality assumptions for the united mine workers of america portion of the postretirement benefit plan obligation causing an actuarially determined increase to the liability at december  this adjustment is recognized as a corresponding decrease to stockholders equity 
other long term liabilities were million at december   an increase of from december  primarily due to the acquisition of western coal during the second quarter of liquidity and capital resources overview our principal sources of short term funding are our existing cash balances  operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our principal source of long term funding is our bank term loans entered into on april  as discussed below 
based on current forecasts and anticipated market conditions  we believe that funding provided by operating cash flows and available sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet substantially all operating needs  to make planned capital expenditures and to make all required interest and principal payments on indebtedness for the next twelve to eighteen months 
however  our operating cash flows and liquidity are significantly influenced by numerous factors including prices of coal  coal production  costs of raw materials  interest rates and the general economy 
although we have experienced improvement in the market for our products  renewed deterioration of economic conditions or deteriorating mining conditions could adversely impact our operating cash flows 
additionally  although financial market conditions have improved there remains volatility and uncertainty  limited availability of credit  potential counterparty defaults  sovereign credit concerns and commercial and investment bank stress 
while we have no indication that the uncertainty in the financial markets would impact our current credit facility or current credit providers  the possibility does exist 
credit agreement on april   we entered into a billion credit agreement the credit agreement to partially fund the acquisition of western coal and to pay off all outstanding loans under the credit agreement

contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have certain contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
contractual obligations are those that will require cash payments in accordance with the terms of a contract  such as a borrowing or lease agreement 
commercial commitments represent potential obligations for performance in the event of demands by third parties or other contingent events  such as lines of credit or guarantees of debt

ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
ebitda is a financial measure which is not calculated in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and should be considered supplemental to  and not as a substitute or superior to financial measures calculated in conformity with us gaap 
we believe that ebitda is a useful measure as some investors and analysts use ebitda to compare us against other companies and to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations and capital expenditure needs 
ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 

table of contents reconciliation of net income to ebitda in thousands for the years ended december  net income add interest expense less interest income add income tax expense add depreciation and depletion expense add loss from discontinued operations earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and depletion ebitda critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis is based on  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  particularly note of notes to consolidated financial statements which presents revenues and operating income by reportable segment 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements or disclosed in the related notes thereto 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  using historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from management s estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates are based upon management s historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists or third party consultants 
a number of sources of information are used to determine accurate recoverable reserves estimates including geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  previously completed geological and reserve studies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 

table of contents reserve estimates will change from time to time to reflect  among other factors mining activities  new engineering and geological data  acquisition or divestiture of reserve holdings  and modification of mining plans or mining methods 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures  as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates 
at december   our current operations had million metric tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
business combinations at acquisition  we allocate the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of appraisals  consideration of market quotes for similar transactions  employment of discounted cash flow techniques or consideration of other information we believe relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts  adjustments are recorded 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
once final  it is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like mineral interests  property  plant and equipment and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of spending estimates to reclaim surface lands and supporting infrastructure at both surface and underground mines in accordance with applicable reclamation laws in the us  canada and us as defined by each mining permit 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse piles and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  and sealing portals at underground mines 
asset retirement obligations are determined for each mine using various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage and the timing of these cash flows  discounted using a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire asset retirement obligation liability and make necessary adjustment for permit changes  the timing of mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
as changes in estimates occur  the carrying amount of the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate 
if our assumptions differ from actual experience  or if changes in the regulatory environment occur  our actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different 
table of contents than currently estimated 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
employee benefits we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retirees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by us gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions used in developing the required estimates including the following key factors discount rate salary growth retirement rates mortality rates healthcare cost trends expected return on plan assets pension benefits other benefits december  december  december  december  weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic cost discount rate expected return on plan assets rate of compensation increase december  pre post pre post assumed health care cost trend rates health care cost trend rate assumed for next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates  discount rates  expected return on plan assets and salary increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension and healthcare plans 
a one percentage point change in the rate for 
table of contents each of these assumptions would have had the following effects as of and for the year ended december  in thousands increase decrease percentage point increase percentage point decrease healthcare cost trend effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation discount rate effect on postretirement service and interest cost components effect on postretirement benefit obligation effect on current year postretirement expense effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense expected return on plan assets effect on current year pension expense rate of compensation increase effect on pension service and interest cost components effect on pension benefit obligation effect on current year pension expense we also have significant liabilities for uninsured or partially insured employee related liabilities  including workers compensation liabilities  miners black lung benefit liabilities  and liabilities for various life and health benefits 
the recorded amounts of these liabilities are based on estimates of loss from individual claims and on estimates determined on an actuarial basis from historical experience using assumptions regarding rates of successful claims  discount factors  benefit increases and mortality rates 
workers compensation and black lung benefit liabilities are also affected by discount rates used 
changes in the frequency or severity of losses from historical experience and changes in discount rates or actual losses on individual claims that differ materially from estimated amounts could affect the recorded amount of these liabilities 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted black lung liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 
for the workers compensation liability  we apply a discount rate at a risk free interest rate  generally a us treasury bill rate  for each policy year 
the rate used is one with a duration that corresponds to the weighted average expected payout period for each policy year 
once a discount rate is applied to a policy year  it remains the discount rate for the year until all claims are paid 
the use of this method decreases the volatility of the liability as impacted by changes in the discount rate 
at december   a one percentage point increase in the discount rate on the discounted workers compensation liability would decrease the liability by million  while a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the liability by million 

table of contents income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the us require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  we had valuation allowances totaling million primarily for capital loss carry forwards not expected to provide future tax benefits 
in our evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we considered various factors including the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in this evaluation  we may need to record a charge to earnings to reflect the change in our expected valuation of the deferred tax assets 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are in dispute with the internal revenue service the irs on a number of federal income tax issues  primarily related to the discontinued homebuilding and financing businesses 
we believe that our tax filing positions have substantial merit and we intend to vigorously defend these positions 
we have established accruals that we believe are sufficient to address claims related to our uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties 
since the issues involved are highly complex  are subject to the uncertainties of extensive litigation and or administrative processes and may require an extended period of time to reach ultimate resolution  it is possible that management s estimate of this liability could change 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets mineral interests  property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment and  if so  assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded  if any  is equal to the amount by which the asset s net book value exceeds its fair market value 
fair market value is generally based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  operating budgets  expected growth rates  and cost of capital 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions  interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside of management s control and these assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
accounting for natural gas exploration activities we apply the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas exploration activities 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized  pending determination of a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves attributable to the area as a result of drilling 
if a commercially sufficient quantity of proved reserves is not discovered  any associated previously capitalized exploration costs associated with the drilling area are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether sufficient proved reserves have been found when drilling of an individual exploratory well has been completed 
such exploratory drilling costs  as well as additional exploratory well costs for the area  may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify the area s completion as a producing well  or field of production and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
at december  and  capitalized exploratory drilling costs were million and million  respectively 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the cost of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas  are capitalized 

table of contents goodwill as of december  we had goodwill of billion 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
we perform our annual goodwill testing as of the beginning of the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using valuation models and expected future cash flows projections  which are then discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in forecasting future cash flows including markets  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  capital spending  working capital changes and the discount rate 
our assumptions regarding future prices and sales volumes require significant judgment as actual prices and volumes have fluctuated in the past and will likely continue to do so 
changes in market conditions could result in impairment charges in the future 
management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or as two separate but consecutive statements 
the accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this accounting standard update will not have an impact on the company s operating results or financial position as it only requires a change in the format of our current presentation of comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires employers that participate in multiemployer pension plans to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures 
the amended disclosures provide users with more detailed information about an employer s involvement and related commitments associated with multiemployer pension plans and became effective for the year ended december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the multiemployer pension plan in which the company participates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
the primary market risk exposures relate to commodity price risk  interest rate risk and foreign currency risks 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have exposure to changes in interest rates under the credit agreement through our term loan a  term loan b and revolver loans 
the interest rates for the term loan a  term loan b and revolver loans are tied to libor or the canadian dealer offered rate cdor  plus a credit spread ranging from to basis points for the revolver and term loan a and to basis points on the term loan b adjusted quarterly based on our total leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement 
as of december   our borrowings due under the credit agreement totaled billion 
as of december  a basis point increase in interest rates would increase our yearly expense by approximately million while a basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease our yearly interest expense by approximately million due to the libor floor 

table of contents our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to protect against the variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to interest payments required under the credit agreement 
to achieve this objective  we manage a portion of our interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates and the risk that changing interest rates could have on our operations  during june we entered into an interest rate swap agreement and an interest rate cap agreement as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the interest rate swap agreement has a notional value of million and is based on a fixed rate 
the interest rate cap agreement has a notional value of million and has a strike price of 
commodity risks we are exposed to commodity price risk on sales of natural gas 
our natural gas business sold billion cubic feet of gas during the year ended december  we occasionally utilize derivative commodity instruments to manage the exposure to changing natural gas prices 
such derivative instruments are structured as cash flow hedges and not for trading 
these swap contracts effectively converted a portion of forecasted sales at floating rate natural gas prices to a fixed rate basis 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  in order to reduce the risk associated with natural gas price volatility  on june  we entered into a one year swap contract to hedge million mmbtus of natural gas sales at a price of per mmbtu beginning in july and ending june the swap agreement will hedge approximately of anticipated natural gas sales from july until june during  we hedged approximately of our natural gas sales with swap contracts 
at december   no swap contracts were outstanding
