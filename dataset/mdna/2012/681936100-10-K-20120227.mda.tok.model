we maintain a portfolio of long term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located throughout the united states 
our investments are generally geographically diverse and operated by a diverse group of established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management 
our criteria for evaluating potential investments includes but is not limited to the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility  the facility s historical and forecasted cash flow and its ability to meet operational needs  capital expenditure requirements and lease or debt service obligations  the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  the location of the facility  the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the applicable jurisdiction  the occupancy rate for the facility and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients at the facility 
we seek to obtain i contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and ii fixed rate mortgage loans 
we typically obtain substantial liquidity deposits  covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
we prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  we may pursue alternative investment structures 
the following summarizes our primary investment structures 
the average annualized yields described below reflect existing contractual arrangements 
however  due to the nature of the long term care industry  we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
therefore  the annualized yields as of january   set forth below  are not necessarily indicative of future yields  which may be lower 
purchase leaseback 
in a purchase leaseback transaction  we purchase a property from an operator and lease it back to the operator over a term typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
our leases generally provide for minimum annual rentals that are subject to annual formula increases based on factors such as increases in the consumer price index cpi 
at january   our average annualized yield from leases was approximately 
fixed rate mortgage 
our mortgages typically have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
at january   our average annualized yield on these investments was approximately 
the table set forth in item properties contains information regarding our properties and investments as of december  borrowing policies 
we generally attempt to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets and employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
we may use the proceeds of new indebtedness to finance our investments in additional healthcare facilities 
in addition  we may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
policies with respect to certain activities 
with respect to our capital requirements  we typically rely on equity offerings  debt financing and retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code concerning taxability of undistributed reit taxable income  or a combination of these methods 
our financing alternatives include bank borrowings  publicly or privately placed debt instruments  purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets or securitizations  any of which may be issued as secured or unsecured indebtedness 
we have the authority to issue our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our securities 
subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for reit qualification  we may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 
we may engage in the purchase and sale of investments 
we do not underwrite the securities of other issuers 
our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
in the opinion of our management  our properties are adequately covered by insurance 
competition 
the healthcare industry is highly competitive and will likely become more competitive in the future 
we face competition from other reits  investment companies  private equity and hedge fund investors  healthcare operators  lenders  developers and other institutional investors  some of whom have greater resources and lower costs of capital than us 
our operators compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services 
the basis of competition for our operators includes the quality of care provided  reputation  the physical appearance of a facility  price  the range of services offered  family preference  alternatives for healthcare delivery  the supply of competing properties  physicians  staff  referral sources  location and the size and demographics of the population and surrounding areas 
increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our objectives 
our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends  availability of investment alternatives  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  existing laws and regulations  new legislation and population trends

taxation the following is a general summary of the material us federal income tax considerations applicable to i us  ii the holders of our securities and iii our election to be taxed as a reit 
it is not tax advice 
this summary is not intended to represent a detailed description of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to a particular stockholder in view of any person s particular circumstances  nor is it intended to represent a detailed description of the us federal income tax consequences applicable to stockholders subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws such as insurance companies  tax exempt organizations  financial institutions  securities broker dealers  investors in pass through entities  expatriates and taxpayers subject to alternative minimum taxation 
the following discussion  to the extent it constitutes matters of law or legal conclusions assuming the facts  representations and assumptions upon which the discussion is based are accurate  accurately represents some of the material us federal income tax considerations relevant to ownership of our securities 
the sections of the internal revenue code the code relating to the qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the code sections that govern the us federal income tax treatment of a reit and its stockholders 
the following sets forth certain material aspects of those sections 
the information in this section is based on  and is qualified in its entirety by the code  current  temporary and proposed treasury regulations promulgated under the code  the legislative history of the code  current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service irs  and court decisions  in each case  as of the date of this report 
in addition  the administrative interpretations and practices of the irs include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings  which are not binding on the irs  except with respect to the particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings 
general 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit  under sections through of the code  beginning with our taxable year ended december  we believe that we were organized and have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit 
we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to maintain our qualification as a reit  but no assurance can be given that we have operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit 
if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders 
however  we will be subject to certain federal income taxes as follows first  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable income  including undistributed net capital gains  provided  however  that if we have a net capital gain  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our undistributed reit taxable income  computed without regard to net capital gain and the deduction for capital gains dividends  plus a tax on undistributed net capital gain  if our tax as thus computed is less than the tax computed in the regular manner 
second  under certain circumstances  we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference that we do not distribute or allocate to our stockholders 
third  if we have i net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property  which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  or ii other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if we have net income from prohibited transactions which are  in general  certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business by us  ie  when we are acting as a dealer  such income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if we should fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test as discussed below  but nonetheless have maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  we will be subject to a tax on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the or test  multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability 
sixth  if we should fail to distribute by the end of each year at least the sum of i of our reit ordinary income for such year  ii of our reit capital gain net income for such year  and iii any undistributed taxable income from prior periods  we will be subject to a excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
seventh  we will be subject to a excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary trs that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
eighth  if we acquire any asset that is defined as a built in gain asset from a c corporation that is not a reit ie  generally a corporation subject to full corporate level tax in a transaction in which the basis of the built in gain asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the c corporation  and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the year period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us such period  the recognition period  then  to the extent of the built in gain ie  the excess of a the fair market value of such asset on the date such asset was acquired by us over b our adjusted basis in such asset on such date  our recognized gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the results described above with respect to the recognition of built in gain assume that we will not make an election pursuant to treasury regulations section d c 
requirements for qualification 
the code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares  or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the code  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company as defined in provisions of the code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  during the last half year of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities  and which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its annual distributions to stockholders 
the code provides that conditions to inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of twelve months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months 
for purposes of conditions and  pension funds and certain other tax exempt entities are treated as individuals  subject to a look through exception in the case of condition 
income tests 
to maintain our qualification as a reit  we annually must satisfy two gross income requirements 
first  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including generally rents from real property  interest on mortgages on real property  and gains on sale of real property and real property mortgages  other than property described in section a of the code and income derived from certain types of temporary investments 
second  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property investments  dividends  interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities other than property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
rents received by us will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of the rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  any amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
second  the code provides that rents received from a tenant other than rent from a tenant that is a trs that meets the requirements described below will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if we  or an owner actually or constructively of or more of the value of our stock  actually or constructively owns or more of such tenant  which is defined as a related party tenant 
third  if rent attributable to personal property  leased in connection with a lease of real property  is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from which we derive no revenue 
we may  however  directly perform certain services that are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property 
in addition  we may directly provide a minimal amount of non customary services to the tenants of a property as long as our income from the services does not exceed of our income from the related property 
furthermore  we may own up to of the stock of a trs  which may provide customary and non customary services to our tenants without tainting our rental income from the related properties 
for our tax years beginning after  rents for customary services performed by a trs or that are received from a trs and are described in code section b no longer need to meet the excise tax safe harbor 
instead  such payments avoid the excise tax if we pay the trs at least of its direct cost of furnishing such services 
beginning in  we were allowed to include as qualified rents from real property rental income that is paid to us by a trs with respect to a lease of a health care facility to the trs provided that the facility is operated and managed by an eligible independent contractor  although none of our facilities were leased to any of our trss 
the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly if the determination of such amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on i a fixed percentage or ii percentages of gross receipts or sales 
in addition  an amount that is based on the income or profits of a debtor will be qualifying interest income as long as the debtor derives substantially all of its income from the real property securing the debt from leasing substantially all of its interest in the property  but only to the extent that the amounts received by the debtor would be qualifying rents from real property if received directly by a reit 
if a loan contains a provision that entitles us to a percentage of the borrower s gain upon the sale of the real property securing the loan or a percentage of the appreciation in the property s value as of a specific date  income attributable to that loan provision will be treated as gain from the sale of the property securing the loan  which generally is qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests 
interest on debt secured by mortgages on real property or on interests in real property generally is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
however  if the highest principal amount of a loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan as of the date we agreed to originate or acquire the loan  a portion of the interest income from such loan will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but will be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test 
the portion of the interest income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test will be equal to the portion of the principal amount of the loan that is not secured by real property 
the extreme duress being experienced by the real estate market has required a number of lenders and borrowers to modify the terms of their mortgage loans 
a modification of a mortgage loan  if it is deemed substantial for income tax purposes  could be considered to be the deemed issuance of a new mortgage loan that is subject to re testing under these rules  with the possible re characterization of the mortgage interest on such loan as non qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test but not the gross income test  which is discussed below  as well as non qualifying assets under the asset test discussed below and the deemed exchange of the modified loan for the new loan could result in imposition of the prohibited transaction tax also discussed below 
the irs recently issued guidance providing relief in the case of certain existing mortgage loans held by a reit that are modified in response to these market conditions such that i the modified mortgage loan need not be re tested for purposes of determining whether the income from the mortgage loan continues to be qualified income for purposes of the gross income test or whether the mortgage loan retains its character as a qualified reit asset for purposes of the asset test discussed below  and ii the modification of the loan will not be treated as a prohibited transaction 
at present  we do not hold any mortgage loans that have been modified  which would require us to take advantage of these rules for special relief 
prohibited transactions 
we will incur a tax on the net income derived from any sale or other disposition of property  other than foreclosure property  that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
we believe that none of our assets is primarily held for sale to customers and that a sale of any of our assets would not be in the ordinary course of our business 
whether a reit holds an asset primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends  however  on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time  including those related to a particular asset 
nevertheless  we will attempt to comply with the terms of safe harbor provisions in the federal income tax laws prescribing when an asset sale will not be characterized as a prohibited transaction 
the code also provides a number of alternative exceptions from the tax on prohibited transactions if certain requirements have been satisfied with respect to property disposed of by a reit 
these requirements relate primarily to the number and or amount of properties disposed of by a reit  the period of time the property has been held by the reit  and or aggregate expenditures made by the reit with respect to the property being disposed of 
the conditions needed to meet these requirements have been lowered for taxable years beginning in and thereafter 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the safe harbor provisions or that we would be able to avoid the tax on prohibited transactions if we were to dispose of an owned property that otherwise may be characterized as property that we hold primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
foreclosure property 
we will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate on any income from foreclosure property  other than income that otherwise would be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  less expenses directly connected with the production of that income 
however  gross income from foreclosure property is treated as qualifying for purposes of the and gross income tests 
foreclosure property is any real property  including interests in real property  and any personal property incident to such real property that is acquired by a reit as the result of i the reit having bid on such property at foreclosure  or having otherwise reduced such property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law  after there was a default  or ii default was imminent on a lease of such property or on indebtedness that such property secured  for which the related loan or lease was acquired by the reit at a time when the default was not imminent or anticipated  and for which the reit makes a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property 
such property generally ceases to be foreclosure property at the end of the third taxable year following the taxable year in which the reit acquired the property  or longer for a total of up to six years if an extension is granted by the secretary of the treasury 
in the case of a qualified health care property acquired solely as a result of termination of a lease  but not in connection with default or an imminent default on the lease  the initial grace period terminates on the second rather than third taxable year following the year in which the reit acquired the property unless the reit establishes the need for and the secretary of the treasury grants one or more extensions  not exceeding six years in total  including the original two year period  to provide for the orderly leasing or liquidation of the reit s interest in the qualified health care property 
this grace period terminates and foreclosure property ceases to be foreclosure property on the first day on which a lease is entered into for the property that  by its terms  will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the gross income test  or any amount is received or accrued  directly or indirectly  pursuant to a lease entered into on or after such day that will give rise to income that does not qualify for purposes of the gross income test  on which any construction takes place on the property  other than completion of a building or any other improvement  where more than of the construction was completed before default became imminent  or which is more than days after the day on which the reit acquired the property and the property is used in a trade or business that is conducted by the reit  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit itself does not derive or receive any income 
in july  we assumed operating responsibilities for the properties due to the bankruptcy of haven eldercare  llc haven facilities  one of our operators tenants  as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations portfolio and other developments 
in september  we entered into an agreement to lease these facilities to a new operator tenant 
effective september   the new operator tenant assumed operating responsibility for of the facilities and  as of december   we held only two properties for which we retained operating responsibility 
during  the state regulatory process was completed and the requirements necessary to transfer the final two properties to the new operator tenant were met 
as a result  as of december   we no longer had any operating responsibility with respect to properties that we previously foreclosed upon 
as we have previously disclosed  we made an election on our federal income tax return to treat the haven facilities as foreclosure properties and  under the reit foreclosure rules  generally we had to dispose of these properties prior to the close of our tax year  which condition has been met 
accordingly  all of the income from operating the haven facilities was qualifying income for the and gross income tests  but we were subject to corporate income tax at the highest rate on the net income  if any  generated from operating the haven facilities 
the definition of foreclosure property includes any qualified health care property  as defined in code section e acquired by us as the result of the termination or expiration of a lease of such property 
we have from time to time operated qualified healthcare facilities acquired in this manner for up to two years or longer if an extension was granted 
however  we do not currently own any property with respect to which we have made foreclosure property elections other than the haven facilities discussed in the prior paragraph 
properties that we had taken back in a foreclosure or bankruptcy and operated for our own account were treated as foreclosure properties for income tax purposes  pursuant to code section e 
gross income from foreclosure properties was classified as good income for purposes of the annual reit income tests upon making the election on the tax return 
once made  the income was classified as good for a period of three years  or until the properties were no longer operated for our own account 
in all cases of foreclosure property  we utilized an independent contractor to conduct day to day operations to maintain reit status 
in certain cases  we operated these facilities through a taxable reit subsidiary 
for those properties operated through the taxable reit subsidiary  we utilized an eligible independent contractor to conduct day to day operations to maintain reit status 
as a result of the foregoing  we do not believe that our participation in the operation of nursing homes increased the risk that we would fail to qualify as a reit 
through our taxable year  we had not paid any tax on our foreclosure property because those properties had been producing losses 
we cannot predict whether  in the future  our income from foreclosure property will be significant and whether we could be required to pay a significant amount of tax on that income 
hedging transactions 
from time to time  we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities 
our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps  caps and floors  options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts 
to the extent that we enter into an interest rate swap or cap contract  option  futures contract  forward rate agreement  or any similar financial instrument to hedge our indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any periodic income or gain from the disposition of that contract should be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
accordingly  our income and gain from our interest rate swap agreements generally is qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
to the extent that we hedge with other types of financial instruments  or in other situations  it is not entirely clear how the income from those transactions will be treated for purposes of the gross income tests 
we have structured and intend to continue to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit 
for tax years beginning after  we were no longer required to include income from hedging transactions in gross income ie  not included in either the numerator or the denominator for purposes of the gross income test and we are no longer required to include in gross income ie  not included in either the numerator or the denominator for purposes of the gross income test any gross income from any hedging transaction entered into after july  we did not engage in hedge transactions in  or trs income 
a trs may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent reit 
both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs 
a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs 
overall  no more than of the value of a reit s assets may consist of securities of one or more trss 
prior to  a trs was not permitted to directly or indirectly i operate or manage a health care or lodging facility  or ii provide to any other person under a franchise  license  or otherwise rights to any brand name under which a health care or lodging facility is operated 
beginning in  trss became permitted to own or lease a health care facility provided that the facility is operated and managed by an eligible independent contractor 
a trs will pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns 
in addition  the new rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation 
the rules also impose a excise tax on transactions between a trs and its parent reit or the reit s operators that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
as stated above  we do not lease any of our facilities to any of our trss 
failure to satisfy income tests 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code 
these relief provisions will be generally available if our failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our tax return  and any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
it is not possible  however  to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
even if these relief provisions apply  we would incur a tax on the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which we fail the and gross income tests  multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability and we would file a schedule with descriptions of each item of gross income that caused the failure 
asset tests 
at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must also satisfy the following tests relating to the nature of our assets 
first  at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including i our allocable share of real estate assets held by partnerships in which we own an interest and ii stock or debt instruments held for less than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of our company  cash  cash items and government securities 
second  of our investments not included in the asset class  the value of our interest in any one issuer s securities may not exceed of the value of our total assets 
third  we may not own more than of the voting power or value of any one issuer s outstanding securities 
fourth  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more trss 
fifth  no more than of the value of our total assets may consist of the securities of trss and other non trs taxable subsidiaries and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the asset test 
for purposes of the second and third asset tests described below the term securities does not include our equity or debt securities of a qualified reit subsidiary  a trs  or an equity interest in any partnership  since we are deemed to own our proportionate share of each asset of any partnership of which we are a partner 
furthermore  for purposes of determining whether we own more than of the value of only one issuer s outstanding securities  the term securities does not include i any loan to an individual or an estate  ii any code section rental agreement  iii any obligation to pay rents from real property  iv certain government issued securities  v any security issued by another reit  and vi our debt securities in any partnership  not otherwise excepted under i through v above  a to the extent of our interest as a partner in the partnership or b if of the partnership s gross income is derived from sources described in the income test set forth above 
we may own up to of the stock of one or more trss 
however  overall  no more than of the value of our assets may consist of securities of one or more trss  and no more than of the value of our assets may consist of the securities of trss and other non trs taxable subsidiaries including stock in non reit c corporations and other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the asset test 
if the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan exceeds the fair market value of the real property securing the loan  a portion of such loan likely will not be a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the test 
the nonqualifying portion of that mortgage loan will be equal to the portion of the loan amount that exceeds the value of the associated real property 
as discussed under the gross income test see above  the irs recently provided relief from re testing certain mortgage loans held by a reit that have been modified as a result of the current distressed market conditions with respect to real property 
at present  we do not hold any mortgage loans that have been modified  which would require us to take advantage of these rules for special relief 
after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter  we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy any of the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
subject to certain de minimis exceptions  we may avoid reit disqualification in the event of certain failures under the asset tests  provided that i we file a schedule with a description of each asset that caused the failure  ii the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  iii we dispose of the assets within months after the last day of the quarter in which the identification of the failure occurred or the requirements of the rules are otherwise met within such period and iv we pay a tax on the failure equal to the greater of a  per failure and b the product of the net income generated by the assets that caused the failure for the period beginning on the date of the failure and ending on the date we dispose of the asset or otherwise satisfy the requirements multiplied by the highest applicable corporate tax rate 
annual distribution requirements 
to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
in addition  such distributions are required to be made pro rata  with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class  and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain  or distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if we fail to distribute during a calendar year  or by the end of january following the calendar year in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year  at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain income for such year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods 
we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts we actually distribute 
we may elect to retain and pay income tax on the net long term capital gain we receive in a taxable year 
if we so elect  we will be treated as having distributed any such retained amount for purposes of the excise tax described above 
we have made  and we intend to continue to make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy the annual distribution requirements 
we may also be entitled to pay and deduct deficiency dividends in later years as a relief measure to correct errors in determining our taxable income 
although we may be able to avoid income tax on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends  we will be required to pay interest to the irs based upon the amount of any deduction we take for deficiency dividends 
the availability to us of  among other things  depreciation deductions with respect to our owned facilities depends upon the treatment by us as the owner of such facilities for federal income tax purposes  and the classification of the leases with respect to such facilities as true leases rather than financing arrangements for federal income tax purposes 
the questions of whether we are the owner of such facilities and ii the leases are true leases for federal tax purposes  are essentially factual matters 
we believe that we will be treated as the owner of each of the facilities that we lease  and such leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
however  no assurances can be given that the irs will not successfully challenge our status as the owner of our facilities subject to leases  and the status of such leases as true leases  asserting that the purchase of the facilities by us and the leasing of such facilities merely constitute steps in secured financing transactions in which the lessees are owners of the facilities and we are merely a secured creditor 
in such event  we would not be entitled to claim depreciation deductions with respect to any of the affected facilities 
as a result  we might fail to meet the distribution requirement or  if such requirement is met  we might be subject to corporate income tax or the excise tax 
reasonable cause savings clause 
we may avoid disqualification in the event of a failure to meet certain requirements for reit qualification if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect  and if the reit pays a penalty of  for each such failure 
this reasonable cause safe harbor is not available for failures to meet the and gross income tests  the rules with respect to ownership of securities of more than of a single issuer and the new rules provided for failures of the asset tests 
failure to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and the reasonable cause relief provisions do not apply  we will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible  and our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders 
in addition  if we fail to qualify as a reit  all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as ordinary income  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  and  subject to certain limitations of the code  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to such statutory relief 
failure to qualify could result in our incurring indebtedness or liquidating investments to pay the resulting taxes 
other tax matters 
we own and operate a number of properties through qualified reit subsidiaries qrss 
the qrss are treated as qualified reit subsidiaries under the code 
code section i provides that a corporation that is a qualified reit subsidiary shall not be treated as a separate corporation  and all assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary shall be treated as assets  liabilities and such items as the case may be of the reit 
thus  in applying the tests for reit qualification described above  the qrss will be ignored  and all assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction  and credit of such qrss will be treated as our assets  liabilities and items of income  deduction  and credit 
in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership  such reit is treated as owning its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership and as earning its allocable share of the gross income of the partnership for purposes of the applicable reit qualification tests 
thus  our proportionate share of the assets  liabilities  and items of income of any partnership  joint venture  or limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes in which we own an interest  directly 
government regulation and reimbursement the following is a description of certain of the laws and regulations and reimbursement policies and programs affecting our business and the businesses conducted by our operators 
the following description should be read in conjunction with the risk factors described under item a risk factors 
healthcare reform 
the patient protection and affordable care act and accompanying healthcare and education affordability and reconciliation act of the healthcare reform law were signed into law in march this legislation represents the most comprehensive change to healthcare benefits since the inception of the medicare program in and will affect reimbursement for governmental programs  private insurance and employee welfare benefit plans in various ways 
some changes under the healthcare reform law have already occurred  such as changes to pre existing condition requirements and coverage of dependents 
other changes  including taxes on so called cadillac health plans  will be implemented over time 
there has already been significant rule making and regulation promulgation under the healthcare reform law  and we expect significant additional rules and regulations 
the attorneys general for several states  as well as other individuals and organizations  have challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the healthcare reform law  including the requirement that each individual carry health insurance 
a number of the lawsuits have been ruled on by federal appeals courts  but those rulings were not consistent 
several parties have appealed to the us supreme court 
the supreme court has agreed to hear these cases in march  but we cannot predict how it will rule 
further  various congressional leaders have indicated a desire to revisit some or all of the healthcare reform law 
while the us senate voted against repealing the entire healthcare reform law  a number of bills and budget proposals seek to repeal  change or defund certain provisions of the law 
for example  the budget eliminated two programs funded under the healthcare reform law the consumer operated and oriented plan co op and the free choice voucher programs 
further  a number of states have passed legislation intended to block various requirements of the healthcare reform law 
because of these challenges  we cannot predict whether any or all of the legislation will be implemented as enacted  overturned  repealed or modified 
given the multitude of factors involved in the healthcare reform law and the substantial requirements for regulation thereunder  we cannot predict the impact of the healthcare reform law on our operators or their ability to meet their obligations to us 
the healthcare reform law could result in decreases in payments to our operators or otherwise adversely affect the financial condition of our operators  thereby negatively impacting our financial condition 
we cannot predict whether our operators will have the ability to modify certain aspects of their operations to lessen the impact of any increased costs or other adverse effects resulting from changes in governmental programs  private insurance and or employee welfare benefit plans 
the impact of the healthcare reform law on each of our operators will vary depending on payor mix  resident conditions and a variety of other factors 
in addition to the provisions relating to reimbursement  other provisions of the healthcare reform law may impact our operators as employers eg  requirements related to providing health insurance for employees  which could negatively impact the financial condition of our operators 
we anticipate that many of the provisions in the healthcare reform law may be subject to further clarification and modification during the rule making process 
the healthcare reform law requires snfs to implement  by march  a compliance and ethics program that is effective in preventing and detecting criminal  civil and administrative violations and in promoting quality of care 
snfs will be required to implement a quality assurance and performance improvement program within one year following promulgation of guidance by the centers for medicare and medicaid services the cms 
snfs will be required to provide additional information for the cms nursing home compare website regarding staffing as well as summary information regarding the number of criminal violations by a facility or its employees committed within the facility  and specification of those that were crimes of abuse  neglect  criminal sexual abuse or other violations or crimes resulting in serious bodily injury  and  in addition  the number of civil monetary penalties imposed on the facility  its employees  contractors and other agents  to further the ability of consumers to compare nursing homes 
reimbursement 
a significant portion of our operators revenue is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  primarily medicare and medicaid 
the federal government and many state governments are currently focusing on reducing expenditures under medicare and medicaid programs  resulting in significant cost cutting at both the federal and state levels 
these cost cutting measures  together with the implementation of changes in reimbursement rates under the healthcare reform law  could result in a significant reduction of reimbursement rates to our operators under both the medicare and medicaid programs 
we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are adequate and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their obligations to us 
however  significant limits on the scopes of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators results of operations and financial condition  which could adversely affect our operators ability to meet their obligations to us 
in august  the budget control act of was enacted into law to increase the federal debt ceiling 
the law provided for spending cuts of nearly trillion over the next years  including proposed cuts to medicare providers 
the law further created a congressional committee that was given a deadline of november  to develop recommendations for further reducing the federal deficit by another trillion over years 
the committee was unable to agree on a plan by the november deadline  and as a result  automatic spending cuts  including a likely cut to medicare providers  will become effective beginning in medicaid is exempted from the automatic cuts 
medicaid 
state budgetary concerns coupled with the implementation of rules under the healthcare reform law  may result in significant changes in healthcare spending at the state level 
many states are currently focusing on the reduction of expenditures under their state medicaid programs  which may result in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our operators 
the need to control medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes 
in addition  medicaid enrollment may significantly increase in the near future  as the healthcare reform law allows states to increase the number of people who are eligible for medicaid beginning in and simplifies enrollment in this program 
since our operators profit margins on medicaid patients are generally relatively low  more than modest reductions in medicaid reimbursement and an increase in the number of medicaid patients could adversely affect our operators results of operations and financial conditions  which in turn could negatively impact us 
medicare 
in  the cms finalized a revised case mix classification system  the rug iv  and planned implementation for fiscal year however  the healthcare reform law delayed implementation of rug iv to october  the medicare and medicaid extenders act of repealed the delay in implementation under the healthcare reform law and provided that rug iv would be implemented immediately and applied retroactively to october  according to the cms  this change in case mix classification methodology resulted in a significant increase in medicare expenditures for fiscal year in response to this increase  on july   the cms announced the final rule for snf funding for fiscal year the final rule includes a recalibration of the case mix indexes that form the rug iv and will result in a reduction of aggregate medicare reimbursement to snfs of billion or 
however  the reduction is partially offset by an update that reflects a increase in the prices of a market basket of goods and services reduced by a multi factor productivity adjustment mandated by the healthcare reform law 
the combination of the recalibration and the update will yield a net reduction of aggregate medicare reimbursement to snfs of billion or 
we believe that the implementation of rug iv in had a positive effect on the cash flow and rent coverage ratios of our operators 
this funding cut will reduce operator coverage ratios  however  we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are adequate and that our operators can absorb the fiscal year reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their obligations to us 
the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of mippa became law on july   and made a variety of changes to medicare  some of which may affect snfs 
for instance  mippa extended the therapy cap exceptions process through december  a number of other laws have further extended the therapy cap exceptions process  with the current expiration set to occur on december  the therapy caps limit the physical therapy  speech language therapy and occupational therapy services that a medicare beneficiary can receive during a calendar year 
these caps do not apply to therapy services covered under medicare part a for snfs  although the caps apply in most other instances involving patients in snfs or long term care facilities who receive therapy services covered under medicare part b 
congress implemented a temporary therapy cap exceptions process  which permits medically necessary therapy services to exceed the payment limits 
expiration of the therapy cap exceptions process in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operators financial condition and operations  which could adversely impact their ability to meet their obligations to us 
the president s proposed budget for federal fiscal year includes a number of proposals that could have an impact on medicare rates if they are ultimately implemented as proposed 
among other things  the proposed budget includes a realignment of payments with costs through adjustments to payment rate updates for skilled nursing facilities by percentage points beginning in through the proposal would reduce bad debt payments to skilled nursing facilities to over years 
the proposed budget would also reduce payments by up to for skilled nursing facilities with high rates of care sensitive  preventable hospital readmissions  beginning in quality of care initiatives 
the cms has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the quality of care provided by nursing homes that could affect our operators 
for instance  in december  the cms released quality ratings for all of the nursing homes that participate in medicare or medicaid 
facility rankings  ranging from five stars much above average to one star much below average are updated on a monthly basis 
the healthcare reform law includes a requirement that the government accountability office conduct a study of this ranking system  the results of which cannot be predicted 
it is possible that this or any other ranking system could lead to future reimbursement policies that reward or penalize facilities on the basis of the reported quality of care parameters 
office of the inspector general activities 
the office of inspector general s oig work plan for fiscal year  which describes projects that the oig plans to address during the fiscal year  includes a number of projects related to nursing homes 
while we cannot predict the results of the oig s activities  the projects could result in further scrutiny and or oversight of nursing homes 
fraud and abuse 
there are various federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing a wide array of healthcare provider referrals  relationships and arrangements  including laws and regulations prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers 
many of these complex laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted by the relevant governmental authorities and courts 
in addition  federal and state governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
the federal anti kickback statute is a criminal statute that prohibits the knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any remuneration in return for  to induce or to arrange for the referral of individuals for any item or service payable by a federal or state healthcare program 
there is also a civil analogue 
states also have enacted similar statutes covering medicaid payments  and some states have broader statutes 
some enforcement efforts have targeted relationships between snfs and ancillary providers  relationships between snfs and referral sources for snfs and relationships between snfs and facilities for which the snfs serve as referral sources 
the federal self referral law  commonly known as the stark law  is a civil statute that prohibits certain referrals by physicians to entities providing designated health services if these physicians have financial relationships with the entities 
some of the services provided in snfs are classified as designated health services 
there are also criminal provisions that prohibit filing false claims or making false statements to receive payment or certification under medicare and medicaid  as well as failing to refund overpayments or improper payments 
violation of the anti kickback statute or stark law may form the basis for a federal false claims act violation 
in addition  the federal false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  these so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties  including exclusion from medicare  medicaid and all other federal and state healthcare programs 
privacy 
our operators are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information  including the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of and the corresponding regulations promulgated thereunder hipaa 
hipaa was amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act  which was part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  known as the stimulus bill 
the hitech act increases penalties for hipaa violations  imposes stricter requirements on healthcare providers  expands the scope of enforcement and  in most cases  requires notification if there is a breach of unsecured individual protected health information  including notification to the affected individual s  the secretary of the department of human services and  in some cases  the media 
various states have similar laws and regulations that govern the maintenance and safeguarding of patient records  charts and other information generated in connection with the provision of professional medical services 
these laws and regulations require our operators to expend the requisite resources to secure protected health information  including the funding of costs associated with technology upgrades 
operators found in violation of hipaa or any other privacy law or regulation may face large penalties 
in addition  compliance with an operator s notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information could cause reputational harm to an operator s business 
licensing and certification 
our operators and facilities are subject to various federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations  including laws and regulations under medicare and medicaid requiring operators of snfs and alfs to comply with extensive standards governing operations 
governmental agencies administering these laws and regulations regularly inspect our operators facilities and investigate complaints 
our operators and their managers receive notices of observed violations and deficiencies from time to time  and sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them 
other laws and regulations 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affect how our operators conduct their operations  including laws and regulations protecting consumers against deceptive practices and otherwise generally affecting our operators management of their property and equipment and the conduct of their operations including laws and regulations involving fire  health and safety  quality of services  including care and food service  residents rights  including abuse and neglect laws  and the health standards set by the federal occupational safety and health administration

item a risk factors following are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s financial condition  results of operations  business and prospects to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report or the company s other filings with the sec 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other risks described in this report including but not limited to those described under taxation and government regulation and reimbursement under item above 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company and there may be additional risks of which the company is not presently aware or that the company currently considers unlikely to significantly impact the company 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks  and  as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to the operators of our facilities our financial position could be weakened and our ability to make distributions and fulfill our obligations with respect to our indebtedness could be limited if any of our major operators become unable to meet their obligations to us or fail to renew or extend their relationship with us as their lease terms expire or their mortgages mature  or if we become unable to lease or re lease our facilities or make mortgage loans on economically favorable terms 
we have no operational control over our operators 
adverse developments concerning our operators could arise due to a number of factors  including those listed below 
the bankruptcy or insolvency of our operators could limit or delay our ability to recover on our investments 
we are exposed to the risk that a distressed operator may not be able to meet its lease  mortgage or other obligations to us or other third parties 
this risk is heightened during a period of economic or political instability 
although each of our lease and loan agreements typically provide us with the right to terminate  evict an operator  foreclose on our collateral  demand immediate payment and exercise other remedies upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of an operator  title of the united states code  as amended and supplemented the bankruptcy code  would limit or  at a minimum  delay our ability to collect unpaid pre bankruptcy rents and mortgage payments and to pursue other remedies against a bankrupt operator 
leases 
a bankruptcy filing by one of our lessee operators would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre bankruptcy rents or evicting the operator  absent approval of the bankruptcy court 
the bankruptcy code provides a lessee with the option to assume or reject an unexpired lease within certain specified periods of time 
generally  a lessee is required to pay all rent that becomes payable between the date of its bankruptcy filing and the date of the assumption or rejection of the lease although such payments will likely be delayed as a result of the bankruptcy filing 
if one of our lessee operators chooses to assume its lease with us  the operator must cure all monetary defaults existing under the lease including payment of unpaid pre bankruptcy rents and provide adequate assurance of its ability to perform its future obligations under the lease 
if one of our lessee operators opts to reject its lease with us  we would have a claim against such operator for unpaid and future rents payable under the lease  but such claim would be subject to a statutory cap and would generally result in a recovery substantially less than the face value of such claim 
although the operator s rejection of the lease would permit us to recover possession of the leased facility  we would likely face losses  costs and delays associated with re leasing the facility to a new operator 
several other factors could impact our rights under leases with bankrupt operators 
first  the operator could seek to assign its lease with us to a third party 
the bankruptcy code generally disregards anti assignment provisions in leases to permit the assignment of unexpired leases to third parties provided all monetary defaults under the lease are cured and the third party can demonstrate its ability to perform its obligations under the lease 
second  in instances in which we have entered into a master lease agreement with an operator that operates more than one facility  the bankruptcy court could determine that the master lease was comprised of separate  divisible leases each of which could be separately assumed or rejected  rather than a single  integrated lease which would have to be assumed or rejected in its entirety 
finally  the bankruptcy court could re characterize our lease agreement as a disguised financing arrangement  which could require us to receive bankruptcy court approval to foreclose or pursue other remedies with respect to the facility 
mortgages 
a bankruptcy filing by an operator to whom we have made a mortgage loan would typically prevent us from collecting unpaid pre bankruptcy mortgage payments and foreclosing on our collateral  absent approval of the bankruptcy court 
as an initial matter  we could ask the bankruptcy court to order the operator to make periodic payments or provide other financial assurances to us during the bankruptcy case known as adequate protection  but the ultimate decision regarding adequate protection including the timing and amount rests with the bankruptcy court 
in addition  we would need bankruptcy court approval before commencing or continuing any foreclosure action against the operator s facility 
the bankruptcy court could withhold such approval  especially if the operator can demonstrate that the facility is necessary for an effective reorganization and that we have a sufficient equity cushion in the facility 
if the bankruptcy court does not either grant us adequate protection or permit us to foreclose on our collateral  we may not receive any loan payments until after the bankruptcy court confirms a plan of reorganization for the operator 
even if the bankruptcy court permits us to foreclose on the facility  we would still be subject to the losses  costs and other risks associated with a foreclosure sale  including possible successor liability under government programs  indemnification obligations and suspension or delay of third party payments 
should such events occur  our income and cash flow from operations would be adversely affected 
failure by our operators to comply with various local  state and federal government regulations may adversely impact their ability to make debt or lease payments to us 
our operators are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  including those described below  that are subject to frequent and substantial changes sometimes applied retroactively resulting from new legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
the ultimate timing or effect of these changes cannot be predicted 
these changes may have a dramatic effect on our operators costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by both government and other third party payors 
the failure of any of our operators to comply with these laws  requirements and regulations could adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
healthcare reform 
the healthcare reform law represents the most comprehensive change to healthcare benefits since the inception of the medicare program in and will affect reimbursement for governmental programs  private insurance and employee welfare benefit plans in various ways 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement healthcare reform 
we cannot predict the impact of the healthcare reform law on our operators or their ability to meet their obligations to us 
reimbursement  medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of our operators revenue is derived from governmentally funded reimbursement programs  primarily medicare and medicaid 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement healthcare reform  reimbursement  medicaid  and medicare  and the risk factor entitled our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced for a further discussion on governmental and third party payor reimbursement and the associated risks presented to our operators 
failure to maintain certification in these programs would result in a loss of funding from such programs and could negatively impact an operator s ability to meet its obligations to us 
quality of care initiatives 
the cms has implemented a number of initiatives focused on the quality of care provided by nursing homes that could affect our operators  including a quality rating system for nursing homes released in december see item business government regulation and reimbursement quality of care initiatives 
any unsatisfactory rating of our operators under any rating system promulgated by the cms could result in the loss of our operators residents or lower reimbursement rates  which could adversely impact their revenues and our business 
licensing and certification 
our operators and facilities are subject to various federal  state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations  including laws and regulations under medicare and medicaid requiring operators of snfs and alfs to comply with extensive standards governing operations 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement licensing and certification 
governmental agencies administering these laws and regulations regularly inspect our operators facilities and investigate complaints 
our operators and their managers receive notices of observed violations and deficiencies from time to time  and sanctions have been imposed from time to time on facilities operated by them 
failure to obtain any required licensure or certification  the loss or suspension of any required licensure or certification  or any violations or deficiencies with respect to relevant operating standards may require a facility to cease operations or result in ineligibility for reimbursement until the necessary licenses or certifications are obtained or reinstated  or any such violations or deficiencies are cured 
in such event  our revenues from these facilities could be reduced or eliminated for an extended period of time or permanently 
fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
there are various federal and state civil and criminal laws and regulations governing a wide array of healthcare provider referrals  relationships and arrangements  including laws and regulations prohibiting fraud by healthcare providers 
many of these complex laws raise issues that have not been clearly interpreted by the relevant governmental authorities and courts 
in addition  federal and state governments are devoting increasing attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement fraud and abuse 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations  including the anti kickback statute and the stark law  by an operator may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties  including exclusion from medicare  medicaid and all other federal and state healthcare programs 
such fines or penalties could jeopardize an operator s ability to make lease or mortgage payments to us or to continue operating its facility 
privacy laws 
our operators are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations designed to protect the confidentiality and security of patient health information  including hipaa 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement privacy 
these laws and regulations require our operators to expend the requisite resources to secure patient health information  including the funding of costs associated with technology upgrades 
operators found in violation of hipaa or any other privacy law or regulation may face large penalties 
in addition  compliance with an operator s notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information could cause reputational harm to an operator s business 
such penalties and damaged reputation could adversely affect an operator s ability to meet its obligations to us 
other laws 
other federal  state and local laws and regulations affect how our operators conduct their operations 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement other laws and regulations 
we cannot predict the effect that the costs of complying with these laws may have on the revenues of our operators  and thus their ability to meet their obligations to us 
legislative and regulatory developments 
each year  legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal  state and local levels that  if adopted  would result in major changes to the healthcare system 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement in addition to the other risk factors set forth below 
we cannot accurately predict whether any proposals will be adopted  and if adopted  what effect if any these proposals would have on our operators or our business 
provisions of the healthcare reform law require certain changes to reimbursement and studies of reimbursement policies that may adversely affect payments to snfs 
several provisions of the healthcare reform law will affect medicare payments to snfs  including  but not limited to  provisions changing the payment methodology  implementing value based purchasing and payment bundling and studying the appropriateness of restrictions on payments for health care acquired conditions 
these provisions are in various stages of implementation see item business government regulation and reimbursement healthcare reform  reimbursement  medicaid  and medicare 
although we cannot accurately predict whether or how such provisions may be implemented  or the effect any such implementation would have on our operators or our business  the healthcare reform law could result in decreases in payments to our operators  increase our operators costs or otherwise adversely affect the financial condition of our operators  thereby negatively impacting their ability to meet their obligations to us 
the healthcare reform law imposes additional requirements on snfs regarding compliance and disclosure 
the healthcare reform law requires snfs to implement  by march  a compliance and ethics program that is effective in preventing and detecting criminal  civil and administrative violations and in promoting quality of care 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement healthcare reform 
if our operators fall short in their compliance and ethics programs and quality assurance and performance improvement programs  or if the information they provide to the cms for the nursing home compare website reveals significant shortcomings  their reputations and ability to attract residents could be adversely affected 
our operators depend on reimbursement from governmental and other third party payors  and reimbursement rates from such payors may be reduced 
changes in the reimbursement rate or methods of payment from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements for services provided by our operators has in the past  and could in the future  result in a substantial reduction in our operators revenues and operating margins 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement reimbursement  medicaid  and medicare 
we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are adequate and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions and still meet their obligations to us 
however  significant limits on the scopes of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on our operators results of operations and financial condition  which could cause the revenues of our operators to decline and negatively impact their ability to meet their obligations to us 
additionally  net revenue realizable under third party payor agreements can change after examination and retroactive adjustment by payors during the claims settlement processes or as a result of post payment audits 
payors may disallow requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain costs are not reimbursable or reasonable  additional documentation is necessary or certain services were not covered or were not medically necessary 
new legislative and regulatory proposals could impose further limitations on government and private payments to healthcare providers 
in some cases  states have enacted or are considering enacting measures designed to reduce medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
we cannot assure you that adequate third party payor reimbursement levels will continue to be available for the services provided by our operators 
government budget deficits could lead to a reduction in medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
many states are focusing on the reduction of expenditures under their medicaid programs  which may result in a reduction in reimbursement rates for our operators 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement reimbursement  medicaid  and medicare 
these potential reductions could be compounded by the potential for federal cost cutting efforts that could lead to reductions in reimbursement to our operators under both the medicare and medicaid programs 
potential reductions in medicare and medicaid reimbursement to our operators could reduce the cash flow of our operators and their ability to make rent or mortgage payments to us 
the need to control medicaid expenditures may be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in medicaid due to unemployment and declines in family incomes 
medicaid enrollment may significantly increase in the near future  as the healthcare reform law allows states to increase the number of people who are eligible for medicaid beginning in and simplifies enrollment in this program 
since our operators profit margins on medicaid patients are generally relatively low  more than modest reductions in medicaid reimbursement and an increase in the number of medicaid patients could place some operators in financial distress  which in turn could adversely affect us 
if funding for medicare and or medicaid is reduced  it could have a material adverse effect on our operators results of operations and financial condition  which could adversely affect our operators ability to meet their obligations to us 
the budget control act of may result in significant reductions in the funding of the medicare program 
in august  the budget control act of was enacted into law to increase the federal debt ceiling 
the law provided for spending cuts of nearly trillion over the next years 
because of inaction by a congressional committee tasked with recommending a plan that would further reduce the deficit by an additional billion of years  automatic spending cuts will become effective in payments to medicare providers will be cut by  but medicaid is exempted from the automatic cuts 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement reimbursement 
these measures and any future federal legislation relating to federal debt ceiling resulting in reductions in funding for medicare and or medicaid could have a material adverse effect on our operators results of operations and financial condition  which could adversely affect our operators ability to meet their obligations to us 
we may be unable to find a replacement operator for one or more of our leased properties 
from time to time  we may need to find a replacement operator for one or more of our leased properties for a variety of reasons  including upon the expiration of the lease term or the occurrence of an operator default 
during any period in which we are attempting to locate one or more replacement operators  there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments on the applicable property or properties 
we cannot assure you that any of our current or future operators will elect to renew their respective leases with us upon expiration of the terms thereof 
similarly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate a suitable replacement operator or  if we are successful in locating a replacement operator  that the rental payments from the new operator would not be significantly less than the existing rental payments 
our ability to locate a suitable replacement operator may be significantly delayed or limited by various state licensing  receivership  certificate of need or other laws  as well as by medicare and medicaid change of ownership rules 
we also may incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any such licensing  receivership or change of ownership proceedings 
any such delays  limitations and expenses could materially delay or impact our ability to collect rent  obtain possession of leased properties or otherwise exercise remedies for default 
a prolonged economic slowdown could adversely impact our operating income and earnings  as well as the results of operations of our operators  which could impair their ability to meet their obligations to us 
despite the fact that the us economy has started to recover from the recent economic recession  the rate of recovery has been much slower than anticipated 
the united states is continuing to experience the effects of the recession  resulting in continued concerns regarding the adverse impact caused by inflation  deflation  increased unemployment  volatile energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  a distressed real estate market  market volatility and weakened business and consumer confidence 
this difficult operating environment could have an adverse impact on the ability of our operators to maintain occupancy rates  which could harm their financial condition 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses by our operators under our leases and loans could adversely affect our income from investments in our portfolio 
certain third parties may not be able to satisfy their obligations to us or our operators due to uncertainty in the capital markets 
interest rate fluctuations  financial market volatility or credit market disruptions could limit the ability of our operators to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms  which could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us 
similarly  if any of our other counterparties  such as letter of credit issuers  insurance carriers  banking institutions  title companies and escrow agents  experience difficulty in accessing capital or other sources of funds or fails to remain a viable entity  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
our operators may be subject to significant legal actions that could result in their increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
as is typical in the long term healthcare industry  our operators are often subject to claims for damages relating to the services that they provide 
we can give no assurance that the insurance coverage maintained by our operators will cover all claims made against them or continue to be available at a reasonable cost  if at all 
in some states  insurance coverage for the risk of punitive damages arising from professional and general liability claims and or litigation may not  in certain cases  be available to operators due to state law prohibitions or limitations of availability 
as a result  our operators operating in these states may be liable for punitive damage awards that are either not covered or are in excess of their insurance policy limits 
tc healthcare  the entity that operated these facilities on our behalf through an independent contractor on an interim basis  may be named as a defendant in professional liability claims related to the haven facilities as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations portfolio and other developments 
we also believe that there has been  and will continue to be  an increase in governmental investigations of long term care providers  particularly in the area of medicare medicaid false claims  as well as an increase in enforcement actions resulting from these investigations 
insurance is not available to our operators to cover such losses 
any adverse determination in a legal proceeding or governmental investigation  whether currently asserted or arising in the future  could have a material adverse effect on an operator s financial condition 
if an operator is unable to obtain or maintain insurance coverage  if judgments are obtained in excess of the insurance coverage  if an operator is required to pay uninsured punitive damages  or if an operator is subject to an uninsurable government enforcement action  the operator could be exposed to substantial additional liabilities 
such liabilities could adversely affect the operator s ability to meet its obligations to us 
in addition  we may in some circumstances be named as a defendant in litigation involving the services provided by our operators 
although we generally have no involvement in the services provided by our operators  and our standard lease agreements and loan agreements generally require our operators to indemnify us and carry insurance to cover us in certain cases  a significant judgment against us in such litigation could exceed our and our operators insurance coverage  which would require us to make payments to cover the judgment 
increased competition as well as increased operating costs result in lower revenues for some of our operators and may affect the ability of our operators to meet their obligations to us 
the long term healthcare industry is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
our operators are competing with numerous other companies providing similar healthcare services or alternatives such as home health agencies  life care at home  community based service programs  retirement communities and convalescent centers 
our operators compete on a number of different levels including the quality of care provided  reputation  the physical appearance of a facility  price  the range of services offered  family preference  alternatives for healthcare delivery  the supply of competing properties  physicians  staff  referral sources  location and the size and demographics of the population in the surrounding areas 
we cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to meet all of their obligations to us 
our operators may encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents or expand their businesses and therefore affect their ability to pay their lease or mortgage payments 
in addition  the market for qualified nurses  healthcare professionals and other key personnel is highly competitive and our operators may experience difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
increases in labor costs due to higher wages and greater benefits required to attract and retain qualified healthcare personnel incurred by our operators could affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 
this situation could be particularly acute in certain states that have enacted legislation establishing minimum staffing requirements 
we may be unable to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans  and even if we are successful in our foreclosure efforts  we may be unable to successfully find a replacement operator  or operate or occupy the underlying real estate  which may adversely affect our ability to recover our investments 
if an operator defaults under one of our mortgage loans  we may foreclose on the loan or otherwise protect our interest by acquiring title to the property 
in such a scenario  we may be required to make substantial improvements or repairs to maximize the facility s investment potential 
operators may contest enforcement of foreclosure or other remedies  seek bankruptcy protection against our exercise of enforcement or other remedies and or bring claims for lender liability in response to actions to enforce mortgage obligations 
even if we are able to successfully foreclose on the collateral securing our mortgage loans  we may be unable to expeditiously find a replacement operator  if at all  or otherwise successfully operate or occupy the property  which could adversely affect our ability to recover our investment 
certain of our operators account for a significant percentage of our real estate investment and revenues 
at december   approximately of our real estate investments were operated by i sun healthcare group  inc sun  a public company and ii three private company operators and or managers  including  a subsidiaries and or affiliates of communicare health services communicare  b subsidiaries and or affiliates of airamid health management  llc airamid and c signature 
no other operator represents more than of our investments 
for the year ended december   our revenues from operations totaled million  of which approximately million were from communicare and million from sun 
no other operator generated more than of our revenues from operations for the year ended december  we cannot assure you that any of our operators will have sufficient assets  income or access to financing to enable it them to satisfy their obligations to us 
any failure by our operators  and specifically those operators described above  to effectively conduct their operations could materially reduce our revenues and net income  which could in turn reduce the amount of dividends we pay and cause our stock price to decline 
risks related to us and our operations we rely on external sources of capital to fund future capital needs  and if we encounter difficulty in obtaining such capital  we may not be able to make future investments necessary to grow our business or meet maturing commitments 
to qualify as a reit under the code  we are required  among other things  to distribute at least of our reit taxable income each year to our stockholders 
because of this distribution requirement  we may not be able to fund  from cash retained from operations  all future capital needs  including capital needed to make investments and to satisfy or refinance maturing commitments 
as a result  we rely on external sources of capital  including debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to obtain needed capital at all or only on unfavorable terms from these sources  we might not be able to make the investments needed to grow our business  or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature  which could negatively affect the ratings of our debt and even  in extreme circumstances  affect our ability to continue operations 
our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control  including the performance of the national and global economies generally  competition in the healthcare industry  issues facing the healthcare industry  including regulations and government reimbursement policies  our operators operating costs  the ratings of our debt securities  the market s perception of our growth potential  the market value of our properties  our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions  and the market price of the shares of our capital stock 
difficult capital market conditions in our industry during the past several years  and our need to stabilize our portfolio have limited and may continue to limit our access to capital 
while we currently have sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our obligations and commitments  we may not be in position to take advantage of future investment opportunities in the event that we are unable to access the capital markets on a timely basis or we are only able to obtain financing on unfavorable terms 
economic conditions and turbulence in the credit markets may create challenges in securing third party borrowings or refinancing our existing debt 
current economic conditions  the availability and cost of credit  turmoil in the mortgage market and depressed real estate markets have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for real estate markets and the economy as a whole 
while the capital markets have recently shown signs of improvement  the sustainability of an economic recovery is uncertain  and additional levels of market disruption and volatility could impact our ability to secure third party borrowings or refinance our existing debt in the future 
our ability to raise capital through equity sales is dependent  in part  on the market price of our common stock  and our failure to meet market expectations with respect to our business could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and availability of equity capital 
as with other publicly traded companies  the availability of equity capital will depend  in part  on the market price of our common stock which  in turn  will depend upon various market conditions and other factors that may change from time to time including the extent of investor interest  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  our financial performance and that of our operators  the contents of analyst reports about us and the reit industry  general stock and bond market conditions  including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities  which may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions  our failure to maintain or increase our dividend  which is dependent  to a large part  on growth of funds from operations  which in turn depends upon increased revenues from additional investments and rental increases  and other factors such as governmental regulatory action and changes in reit tax laws 
the market value of the equity securities of a reit is generally based upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
our failure to meet the market s expectation with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock and  as a result  the availability of equity capital to us 
we are subject to risks associated with debt financing  which could negatively impact our business and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to repay maturing debt 
the financing required to make future investments and satisfy maturing commitments may be provided by borrowings under our credit facilities  private or public offerings of debt  the assumption of secured indebtedness  mortgage financing on a portion of our owned portfolio or through joint ventures 
to the extent we must obtain debt financing from external sources to fund our capital requirements  we cannot guarantee such financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
in addition  if we are unable to refinance or extend principal payments due at maturity or pay them with proceeds from other capital transactions  our cash flow may not be sufficient to make distributions to our stockholders and repay our maturing debt 
furthermore  if prevailing interest rates  changes in our debt ratings or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase  which could reduce our profitability and the amount of dividends we are able to pay 
moreover  additional debt financing increases the amount of our leverage 
the degree of leverage could have important consequences to stockholders  including affecting our investment grade ratings and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  and making us more vulnerable to a downturn in our results of operations or the economy generally 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new properties could reduce our profitability 
our business strategy contemplates future acquisitions that may not prove to be successful 
for example  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to our acquired properties  including contingent liabilities  or our newly acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
as a further example  if we agree to provide funding to enable healthcare operators to build  expand or renovate facilities on our properties and the project is not completed  we could be forced to become involved in the development to ensure completion or we could lose the property 
such costs may negatively affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to adapt our management and operational systems to integrate and manage our growth without additional expense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management  administrative  accounting and operational systems to integrate and manage the long term care facilities we have acquired in the past and those that we may acquire under our existing cost structure in a timely manner 
our failure to timely integrate and manage recent and future acquisitions or developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be subject to additional risks in connection with our recent and future acquisitions of long term care facilities 
we may be subject to additional risks in connection with our recent and future acquisitions of long term care facilities  including but not limited to the following our limited prior business experience with certain of the operators of the facilities we have recently acquired or may acquire in the future  the facilities may underperform due to various factors  including unfavorable terms and conditions of the lease agreements that we assume  disruptions caused by the management of the operators of the facilities or changes in economic conditions impacting the facilities and or the operators  diversion of our management s attention away from other business concerns  exposure to any undisclosed or unknown potential liabilities relating to the facilities  and potential underinsured losses on the facilities 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage the recently acquired or other new facilities without encountering difficulties or that any such difficulties will not have a material adverse effect on us 
our assets may be subject to impairment charges 
we periodically  but not less than annually  evaluate our real estate investments and other assets for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if we determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we are required to make an adjustment to the net carrying value of the asset  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
we may not be able to sell certain closed facilities for their book value 
from time to time  we close facilities and actively market such facilities for sale 
to the extent we are unable to sell these properties for our book value  we may be required to take a non cash impairment charge or loss on the sale  either of which would reduce our net income 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and we may increase our indebtedness in the future 
debt financing could have important consequences to our stockholders 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business plan or other general corporate purposes on satisfactory terms or at all  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness and leases  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our ability to make material acquisitions or take advantage of business opportunities that may arise  expose us to fluctuations in interest rates  to the extent our borrowings bear variable rates of interests  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
covenants in our debt documents limit our operational flexibility  and a covenant breach could materially adversely affect our operations 
the terms of our credit agreement and note indentures require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants which may limit our management s discretion by restricting our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  redeem our capital stock  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  and create liens 
any additional financing we may obtain could contain similar or more restrictive covenants 
our continued ability to incur indebtedness and conduct our operations is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants 
breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness  in addition to any other indebtedness cross defaulted against such instruments 
any such breach could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have now  and may have in the future  exposure to contingent rent escalators 
we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under leases that are long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual rent escalations  subject to certain limitations 
certain leases contain escalators contingent on changes in the cpi 
if the cpi does not increase  our revenues may not increase 
we are subject to particular risks associated with real estate ownership  which could result in unanticipated losses or expenses 
our business is subject to many risks that are associated with the ownership of real estate 
for example  if our operators do not renew their leases  we may be unable to re lease the facilities at favorable rental rates 
other risks that are associated with real estate acquisition and ownership include  without limitation  the following general liability  property and casualty losses  some of which may be uninsured  the inability to purchase or sell our assets rapidly to respond to changing economic conditions  due to the illiquid nature of real estate and the real estate market  leases that are not renewed or are renewed at lower rental amounts at expiration  the exercise of purchase options by operators resulting in a reduction of our rental revenue  costs relating to maintenance and repair of our facilities and the need to make expenditures due to changes in governmental regulations  including the americans with disabilities act  environmental hazards created by prior owners or occupants  existing tenants  mortgagors or other persons for which we may be liable  acts of god affecting our properties  and acts of terrorism affecting our properties 
our real estate investments are relatively illiquid 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly 
in addition  some of our properties serve as collateral for our secured debt obligations and cannot be readily sold 
additional factors that are specific to our industry also tend to limit our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
for example  all of our properties are special purpose properties that cannot be readily converted into general residential  retail or office use 
in addition  transfers of operations of nursing homes and other healthcare related facilities are subject to regulatory approvals not required for transfers of other types of commercial operations and other types of real estate 
thus  if the operation of any of our properties becomes unprofitable due to competition  age of improvements or other factors such that an operator becomes unable to meet its obligations to us  then the liquidation value of the property may be substantially less  particularly relative to the amount owing on any related mortgage loan  than would be the case if the property were readily adaptable to other uses 
furthermore  the receipt of liquidation proceeds or the replacement of an operator that has defaulted on its lease or loan could be delayed by the approval process of any federal  state or local agency necessary for the transfer of the property or the replacement of the operator with a new operator licensed to manage the facility 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with real estate investment  such as real estate taxes and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from the investment 
should such events occur  our income and cash flows from operations would be adversely affected 
as an owner or lender with respect to real property  we may be exposed to possible environmental liabilities 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner of real property or a secured lender  such as us  may be liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of  or related releases of  certain hazardous or toxic substances at  under or disposed of in connection with such property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
such laws often impose liability based on the owner s knowledge of  or responsibility for  the presence or disposal of such substances 
as a result  liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of an operator of the property 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and the owner s liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or the assets of the owner 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances  may adversely affect an operators ability to attract additional residents and our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral which  in turn  could negatively impact our revenues 
although our leases and mortgage loans require the lessee and the mortgagor to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities  the scope of such obligations may be limited 
for instance  most of our leases do not require the lessee to indemnify us for environmental liabilities arising before the lessee took possession of the premises 
further  we cannot assure you that any such mortgagor or lessee would be able to fulfill its indemnification obligations 
the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
increasing investor interest in our sector and consolidation at the operator of reit level could increase competition and reduce our profitability 
our business is highly competitive and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
we compete for healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other reits  some of which have greater resources and lower costs of capital than we do 
increased competition makes it more challenging for us to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our business goals 
if we cannot capitalize on our development pipeline  identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of healthcare facilities at favorable prices  or if we are unable to finance such acquisitions on commercially favorable terms  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if our cost of capital should increase relative to the cost of capital of our competitors  the spread that we realize on our investments may decline if competitive pressures limit or prevent us from charging higher lease or mortgage rates 
we may be named as defendants in litigation arising out of professional liability and general liability claims relating to our previously owned and operated facilities that if decided against us  could adversely affect our financial condition 
we and several of our wholly owned subsidiaries were named as defendants in professional liability and general liability claims related to our owned and operated facilities prior to other third party managers responsible for the day to day operations of these facilities were also named as defendants in these claims 
in these suits  patients of certain previously owned and operated facilities have alleged significant damages  including punitive damages  against the defendants 
although all of these prior suits have been settled  we or our affiliates could be named as defendants in similar suits related to our owned and operated assets resulting from the transition of the haven facilities as described in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations portfolio and other developments 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in our defense of such potential matters or in asserting our claims against various managers of the subject facilities or that the amount of any settlement or judgment would be substantially covered by insurance or that any punitive damages will be covered by insurance 
our charter and bylaws contain significant anti takeover provisions which could delay  defer or prevent a change in control or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain various procedural and other requirements which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is divided into three classes and the members of our board of directors are elected for terms that are staggered 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to fix the preferences  rights and limitations of the preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us  which could adversely affect the market price of our securities and or result in the delay  deferral or prevention of a change in control or other transactions that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
we may change our investment strategies and policies and capital structure 
our board of directors  without the approval of our stockholders  may alter our investment strategies and policies if it determines that a change is in our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment strategies and policies may vary as new investments and financing techniques are developed 
our success depends in part on our ability to retain key personnel and our ability to attract or retain other qualified personnel 
our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive management team and other key employees 
the loss of the services of our current executive management team could have an adverse impact on our operations 
although we have entered into employment agreements with the members of our executive management team  these agreements may not assure their continued service 
in addition  our future success depends  in part  on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain other qualified personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and we compete for qualified employees with companies with greater financial resources 
our failure to successfully attract  hire  retain and train the people we need would significantly impede our ability to implement our business strategy 
we rely on information technology in our operations  and any material failure  inadequacy  interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business 
we rely on information technology networks and systems  including the internet  to process  transmit and store electronic information  and to manage or support a variety of business processes  including financial transactions and records  personal identifying information  tenant and lease data 
we purchase some of our information technology from vendors  on whom our systems depend 
we rely on commercially available systems  software  tools and monitoring to provide security for processing  transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other customer information  such as individually identifiable information  including information relating to financial accounts 
although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems  it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning or damage  or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber attacks 
security breaches  including physical or electronic break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers and similar breaches  can create system disruptions  shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
any failure to maintain proper function  security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations  damage our reputation  subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and stock price 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
changes to our business will necessitate ongoing changes to our internal control systems and processes 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements due to inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if we experience difficulties in their implementation  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely harmed  we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price 
if we fail to maintain our reit status  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we were organized to qualify for taxation as a reit under sections through of the code 
see item business taxation 
we believe that we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will maintain our qualification as a reit 
qualification as a reit involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements  some on an annual and some on a quarterly basis  established under highly technical and complex provisions of the code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we cannot assure you that we will at all times satisfy these rules and tests 
if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  as a result of a determination that we failed to meet the annual distribution requirement or otherwise  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates with respect to each such taxable year for which the statute of limitations remains open 
moreover  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost 
this treatment would significantly reduce our net earnings and cash flow because of our additional tax liability for the years involved  which could significantly impact our financial condition 
we generally must distribute annually at least of our taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
even if we remain qualified as a reit  we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we remain qualified for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  property and transfer taxes 
any of these taxes would decrease cash available for the payment of our debt obligations 
in addition  to meet reit qualification requirements  we may hold some of our non healthcare assets through taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates 
qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code and complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability 
qualification as a reit involves the application of technical and intricate code provisions 
even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification 
to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the nature and diversification of our assets  the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders 
thus  we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments from our portfolio  or be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us  to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions 
we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution eg  if we have assets which generate mismatches between taxable income and available cash 
having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms  or iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt 
as a result  satisfying the reit requirements could have an adverse effect on our business results and profitability 
risks related to our stock in addition to the risks related to our operators and our operations described above  the following are additional risks associated with our stock 
the market value of our stock could be substantially affected by various factors 
market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as with other publically traded securities  the share price of our stock depends on many factors  which may change from time to time  including the market for similar securities issued by reits  changes in estimates by analysts  our ability to meet analysts estimates  prevailing interest rates  our credit rating  general economic and market conditions  and our financial condition  performance and prospects 
our issuance of additional capital stock  warrants or debt securities  whether or not convertible  may reduce the market price for our outstanding securities  including our common stock  and dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our capital stock  warrants or debt securities  or the availability of our securities for future sale  will have on the market price of our securities  including our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred shares  warrants or debt securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales might occur  could negatively impact the market price of our stock and the terms upon which we may obtain additional equity financing in the future 
in addition  we may issue additional capital stock in the future to raise capital or as a result of the following the issuance and exercise of options to purchase our common stock or other equity awards under remuneration plans 
we may also issue equity to our employees in lieu of cash bonuses or to our directors in lieu of director s fees  the issuance of shares pursuant to our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  the issuance of debt securities exchangeable for our common stock  the exercise of warrants we may issue in the future  lenders sometimes ask for warrants or other rights to acquire shares in connection with providing financing  and we cannot assure you that our lenders will not request such rights  and the sales of securities convertible into our common stock could dilute the interests of existing common stockholders 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein were to occur 
our payment of dividends is subject to compliance with restrictions contained in our credit agreement  the indentures governing our senior notes and any preferred stock that our board of directors may from time to time designate and authorize for issuance 
all dividends will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings  our financial condition  maintenance of our reit status and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
there are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future 
in addition  our dividends in the past have included  and may in the future include  a return of capital 
holders of our preferred stock that we may issue from time to time may have liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
on march   we redeemed all of our issued and outstanding series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
however  our board of directors has the authority to designate and issue preferred stock that may have dividend  liquidation and other rights that are senior to those of our common stock 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect purchasers of our stock 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made in the provisions of the federal income tax laws that have or could impact the income tax consequences in an adverse manner of owning our stock 
changes are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure you that any of these changes will not adversely affect our stockholder s stock 
any of these changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock or on its market value or resale potential 
stockholders are urged to consult with their own tax advisor with respect to the impact that past legislative  regulatory or administrative changes or potential legislation may have on their investment in our stock 
a downgrade of our credit rating could impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable terms  if at all  and significantly reduce the trading price of our common stock 
if any rating agency downgrades our credit rating  or places our rating under watch or review for possible downgrade  this could make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing  and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
factors that may affect our credit rating include  among other things  our financial performance  our success in raising sufficient equity capital  adverse changes in our debt and fixed charge coverage ratios  our capital structure and level of indebtedness and pending or future changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our operators and our industry

geographically diverse property portfolio 
our portfolio of properties is broadly diversified by geographic location

overview we have one reportable segment consisting of investments in healthcare related real estate properties 
our core business is to provide financing and capital to the long term healthcare industry with a particular focus on snfs located in the united states 
our core portfolio consists of long term leases and mortgage agreements 
all of our leases are triple net leases  which require the tenants to pay all property related expenses 
our mortgage revenue derives from fixed rate mortgage loans  which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
on july   through bankruptcy court proceedings  we took ownership and or possession of facilities which were previously operated by haven 
prior to july   we had i leased eight facilities to haven under a master lease agreement and ii provided mortgage financing to a haven entity for seven facilities that we had previously consolidated according to accounting rules regarding variable interest entities then in place 
as a result of the bankruptcy court judgment  the mortgage on the seven facilities was retired in exchange for ownership of the facilities  and we were also awarded certain other operational assets of haven 
in addition to receiving title to the seven facilities and certain other operational assets  on july   we assumed operating responsibility for the haven facilities 
in july  a new entity tc healthcare was formed to operate these properties on our behalf through the use of an independent contractor 
tc healthcare s managing member and sole voting member  an individual with experience in operating these types of facilities  has no equity investment at risk and is unrelated to omega 
omega and tc healthcare entered into an agreement that required omega to provide the working capital requirements for tc healthcare and to absorb the operating losses of tc healthcare 
the agreement also provided omega with the right to receive the economic benefits of the entity 
tc healthcare is a variable interest entity as the entity does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to support its operations without subordinated financial support 
additionally  omega has the power to direct the activities of tc healthcare as omega has the unilateral right to replace the shareholder 
omega is deemed the primary beneficiary of tc healthcare as omega has the controlling economic interest in the entity and therefore  consolidated the operations of tc healthcare 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of i omega  ii all direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of omega and iii tc healthcare 
we consolidate the financial results of tc healthcare into our financial statements based on the applicable consolidation accounting literature 
we include the operating results  assets and liabilities of these facilities for the period of time that tc healthcare was responsible for the operations of the facilities 
thirteen of these facilities were transitioned from tc healthcare to a new tenant operator on september  the two remaining facilities were transitioned to the new tenant operator on june  upon approval by state regulators of the operating license transfer 
the operating revenues and expenses and related operating assets and liabilities of the two facilities are shown on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets  respectively 
tc healthcare was responsible for the collection of the accounts receivable earned and the liabilities incurred prior to the date of the transition to the new tenant operator 
all inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation of the financial statements 
our portfolio of investments at december   consisted of healthcare facilities including six assets held for sale  located in states and operated by third party operators 
our gross investment in these facilities totaled approximately billion at december   with of our real estate investments related to long term healthcare facilities 
the portfolio is made up of i snfs  ii alfs  iii five specialty facilities  iv fixed rate mortgages on snfs and v six facilities and one parcel of land that are currently held for sale 
at december   we also held other investments of approximately million  consisting primarily of secured loans to third party operators of our facilities 
current market and economic conditions  including deficits at both the federal and state level could result in additional cost cutting at both the federal and state levels resulting in additional reductions to reimbursement rates and levels to our operators under both the medicare and medicaid programs 
the state deficit could be exacerbated by the potential for increased enrollment in medicaid due to prolonged high unemployment levels and declining family incomes  which could cause states to reduce state expenditures under their respective state medicaid programs by lowering reimbursement rates 
we currently believe that our operator coverage ratios are strong and that our operators can absorb moderate reimbursement rate reductions under medicaid and medicare and still meet their obligations to us 
however  significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an operator s results of operations and financial condition  which could adversely affect the operator s ability to meet its obligations to us 
and recent highlights acquisition and other investments see portfolio and other developments below for a description of acquisitions and other investments 
series d preferred stock redemption on march   pursuant to authorization from our board of directors  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price of per share plus per share in accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date  for an aggregate redemption price of per share 
dividends on the shares of series d preferred stock ceased to accrue on and after the redemption date  after which the series d preferred stock ceased to be outstanding 
we borrowed approximately million under our previous million senior secured revolving credit facility the credit facility to fund the redemption price 
in connection with the redemption of the series d preferred stock  we wrote off million of preferred stock issuance costs that reduced first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders by approximately per common share 
million senior notes exchange offer on june   we commenced an offer to exchange million of our senior notes due that have been registered under the securities act of for million of our outstanding senior notes due  which were issued in october and november in two separate private placements 
all million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the initial notes were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the exchange offer and were exchanged for exchange notes as of july   pursuant to the terms of the exchange offer 
the exchange notes are identical in all material respects to the initial notes  except that the issuance of the exchange notes was registered under the securities act of and the provisions of the initial notes relating to transfer restrictions  registration rights and additional interest relating to registrations delays do not apply to the exchange notes 
million unsecured revolving credit facility on august   we entered into our new million credit facility and concurrently terminated our credit facility 
the credit facility is unsecured and matures in four years  on august  the credit facility includes an accordion feature that permits us to expand our borrowing capacity to million 
see liquidity and capital resources financing activities and borrowing arrangements below 
million stock repurchase program on august   omega s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock from time to time over a period of months following such authorization 
we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions at the times  and in the manner and amounts  as determined by omega s management and in accordance with the pricing guidelines approved by our board of directors and applicable law 
the timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors  including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock  and such repurchases  if any  may be discontinued at any time 
we fund stock repurchases under the program with borrowings under the credit facility 
on september   we entered into open market transactions to repurchase  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
this repurchase of these common shares settled in the ordinary course on october  dividends on january   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share  increasing the quarterly common dividend by per share over the prior quarter  that was paid february  to common stockholders of record on january  on february   may   august  and november   we paid dividends to our common stockholders in the per share amounts of   and  for stockholders of record on january   april   august  and october   respectively 
we also paid a regular quarterly dividend of approximately per share on the series d preferred stock on february   for stockholders of record on january   as well as all accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including march   the redemption date of the series d preferred stock 
portfolio and other developments the partial expiration of certain medicare rate increases and state cuts to medicaid reimbursement rates has had an adverse impact on the revenues of the operators of nursing home facilities and could negatively impacted some operators ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payment to us 
see item business government regulation and reimbursement above for further discussion 
in several instances  we hold security deposits that can be applied in the event of lease and loan defaults  subject to applicable limitations under bankruptcy law with respect to operators seeking protection under the bankruptcy code

results of operations the following is our discussion of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity and capital resources  which should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes

miscellaneous revenue was million  a decrease of million over the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a million settlement with one of our prior operators in february for breach of contract related to failure to pay rent 
no nursing home revenues of owned and operated assets were recorded in  compared to million for the same period in the decrease was due to the deconsolidation of two owned and operated facilities effective june  operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december   were million  an increase of approximately million over the same period in following is a description of certain of the changes in our operating expenses for the year ended december  our depreciation and amortization expense was million  compared to million for the same period in the increase primarily due to i the capitalsource acquisitions in june  and to a lesser degree ii the white pine and affiliates of cfg acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and iii additional capital renovation and improvement program throughout and  partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense associated with the impairments of the connecticut facilities  the murphy healthcare iii  ltc property and the health and hospital corporation property 
our general and administrative expense  excluding stock based compensation expense was million  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the closed connecticut facilities 
our restricted stock based compensation expense was million  an increase of million over the same period in the increase was primarily due to a new restricted stock grant for the employees 
in  we recorded million of provision for impairment  compared to million for the same period in the million provision of impairment in primarily resulted from i a million impairment on four closed connecticut properties and ii three other facilities that have been or will be closed

other income expense for the year ended december   total other expenses were million  a decrease of approximately million over the same period in the increase in interest expense of approximately million was primarily due to an increase in borrowings outstanding  including debt assumed or incurred to finance the capitalsource acquisitions in  the white pine and affiliates of cfg acquisitions during the fourth quarter of and to fund the ciena and white pine mortgages 
this was offset by i a decrease of million in refinancing related costs which included a the write off of million during the second quarter of associated with the termination of our million credit facility  b the write off of million during the fourth quarter of associated with the termination of our million gecc loan and payment of a million prepayment penalty premium  and c a penalty payment and costs of approximately million and the write off of approximately million during the fourth quarter of associated with the tender offer and retirement of our outstanding million senior notes due  as compared to the write off of million during associated with the termination of the million credit facility and ii a decrease of million in amortization of deferred financing costs related to a the termination of the million credit facility  b the million gecc term loan payoff in october and c the redemption of our outstanding million senior notes in december taxes because we qualify as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the reit taxable income that we distribute to stockholders  subject to certain exceptions 
for tax year  we made preferred and common dividend payments of million to satisfy reit requirements relating to qualifying income 
currently  we have one trs that is taxable as a corporation and that pays federal  state and local income tax on its net income at the applicable corporate rates 
the trs had a net operating loss carry forward as of december  of million 
the loss carry forward was fully reserved with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization 
we recorded interest and penalty charges associated with tax matters as income tax expense 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in funds from operations our funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo  for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the same period in we calculate and report ffo in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  and  consequently  ffo is defined as net income available to common stockholders  adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization and impairment on real estate assets 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue 
ffo herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo of other reits that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we use ffo as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization  impairment on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
we offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under gaap  and ffo should not be considered a measure of liquidity  an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any gaap measure  including net income

taxes because we qualify as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income taxes on the reit taxable income that we distribute to stockholders  subject to certain exceptions 
for tax year  we made preferred and common dividend payments of million to satisfy reit requirements relating to qualifying income 
we are permitted to own up to of a trs 
currently  we have one trs that is taxable as a corporation and that pays federal  state and local income tax on its net income at the applicable corporate rates 
the trs had a net operating loss carry forward as of december  of million 
the loss carry forward was fully reserved with a valuation allowance due to uncertainties regarding realization 
we recorded interest and penalty charges associated with tax matters as income tax expense 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in funds from operations our ffo  for the year ended december   was million  compared to million for the same period in we calculate and report ffo in accordance with the definition and interpretive guidelines issued by the nareit  and  consequently  ffo is defined as net income available to common stockholders  adjusted for the effects of asset dispositions and certain non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization and impairment on real estate assets 
we believe that ffo is an important supplemental measure of our operating performance 
because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires depreciation except on land  such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  while real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the term ffo was designed by the real estate industry to address this issue 
ffo herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo of other reits that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
we use ffo as one of several criteria to measure the operating performance of our business 
we further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization  impairment on real estate assets and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits 
we offer this measure to assist the users of our financial statements in evaluating our financial performance under gaap  and ffo should not be considered a measure of liquidity  an alternative to net income or an indicator of any other performance measure determined in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on this measure as a substitute for any gaap measure  including net income

financing activities and borrowing arrangements million senior notes exchange offer on june   we commenced an offer to exchange million of our senior notes due that have been registered under the securities act of for million of our outstanding senior notes due  which were issued in october and november in two separate private placements 
all million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the initial notes were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the exchange offer  and were exchanged for exchange notes as of july   pursuant to the terms of the exchange offer 
the exchange notes are identical in all material respects to the initial notes  except that the issuance of the exchange notes was registered under the securities act of and the provisions of the initial notes relating to transfer restrictions  registration rights and additional interest relating to registrations delays do not apply to the exchange notes 
credit facility on august   we terminated our credit facility and recorded a non cash charge of approximately million relating to the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the termination of the credit facility for the three month period ended september credit facility on august   concurrent with the termination of our credit facility  we entered into our new million credit facility 
the credit facility matures in four years  on august  the credit facility includes an accordion feature that permits us to expand our borrowing capacity to million

million stock repurchase program on august   omega s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of its outstanding common stock from time to time over a period of months following such authorization 
we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions at the times  and in the manner and amounts  as determined by omega s management and in accordance with the pricing guidelines approved by our board of directors and applicable law 
the timing and amount of stock repurchases will depend on a variety of factors  including market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
we have no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock  and such repurchases  if any  may be discontinued at any time 
we fund stock repurchases under the program with borrowings under the credit facility 
on september   we entered into open market transactions to repurchase  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
this repurchase of these common shares settled in the ordinary course on october  white pine mortgages assumption in connection with the october  white pine acquisition  we assumed approximately million in hud guaranteed indebtedness  which bears an interest ratio of weighted average and matures between march and august affiliates of cfg mortgage assumption in connection with the december   affiliates of cfg acquisitions  we assumed approximately million in hud guaranteed indebtedness  which bears an interest ratio of weighted average and matures between october and july dividends in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain  and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of non cash income 
in addition  if we dispose of any built in gain asset during a recognition period  we will be required to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
in addition  such distributions are required to be made pro rata  with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class  and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
in addition  our credit facility has certain financial covenants that limit the distribution of dividends paid during a fiscal quarter to no more than of our aggregate cumulative ffo as defined in the credit agreement  unless a greater distribution is required to maintain reit status 
solely for purposes of the credit agreement  ffo is defined as net income or loss plus depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude gains or losses resulting from i restructuring our debt  ii sales of property  iii sales or redemptions of preferred stock  iv revenue or expenses related to owned and operated assets  v cash litigation charges up to million over the term of the credit agreement  vi non cash charges associated with the write down of accounts due to straight line rent  vii other non cash charges for accounts and notes receivable up to million over the term of the credit agreement  viii certain non cash compensation related expenses  ix non cash real property impairment charges  x non cash charges associated with the sale or settlement of derivative instruments  and xi charges related to acquisition deal related costs 
in  we paid dividends of per share of common stock and per share of preferred stock 
in  we paid a total of million in dividends to common and preferred stockholders 
common dividends on january   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share  increasing the quarterly common dividend by per share over the prior quarter  that was paid february  to common stockholders of record on january  on october   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share that was paid november  to common stockholders of record on october  on july   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share  increasing the quarterly common dividend by  or  per share over the prior quarter  that was paid august  to common stockholders of record on august  on april   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share  increasing the quarterly common dividend by per share over the prior quarter  that was paid may  to common stockholders of record on april  on january   the board of directors declared a common stock dividend of per share that was paid february  to common stockholders of record on january  series d preferred dividends on january   the board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of approximately per preferred share on the series d preferred stock that was paid february  to preferred stockholders of record on january  redemption of series d preferred stock on march   pursuant to authorization from our board of directors  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price of per share plus per share in accrued and unpaid dividends up to and including the redemption date  for an aggregate redemption price of per share 
dividends on the shares of series d preferred stock ceased to accrue on and after the redemption date  after which the series d preferred stock ceased to be outstanding 
we borrowed approximately million under our previous credit facility to fund the redemption price 
in connection with the redemption of the series d preferred stock  we wrote off million of preferred stock issuance costs that reduced first quarter net income attributable to common stockholders by approximately per common share 
liquidity we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital  including cash from operations  our existing availability under our credit facility and expected proceeds from mortgage payoffs are more than adequate to finance operations  meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months 
we regularly review our liquidity needs  the adequacy of cash flow from operations  and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
we believe our principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service payments  common stock dividends  and growth through acquisitions of additional properties 
the primary source of liquidity is our cash flows from operations 
operating cash flows have historically been determined by i the number of facilities we lease or have mortgages on  ii rental and mortgage rates  iii our debt service obligations  and iv general and administrative expenses 
the timing  source and amount of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to the capital markets environment  especially to changes in interest rates 
changes in the capital markets environment may impact the availability of cost effective capital and affect our plans for acquisition and disposition activity 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december   a decrease of million as compared to the balance at december  the following is a discussion of changes in cash and cash equivalents due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
operating activities net cash flow from operating activities generated million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to the full year impact of rental revenue from the june acquisition of facilities from capitalsource and additional revenue associated with the white pine and affiliates of cfg acquisitions and the placement of additional mortgages  offset by additional interest associated with financing the acquisition and new mortgages 
investing activities net cash flow from investing activities was an outflow of million for year ended december   as compared to an outflow of million for the same period in the decrease in cash outflow from investing activities relates primarily to the change in acquisition activities 
during the year ended december   we acquired million real estate facilities  placed million in new mortgages and invested million in capital improvement projects 
during the year ended december   we acquired million real estate facilities  placed five mortgage and construction to permanent mortgage loans for approximate million and invested million in capital improvement projects 
financing activities net cash flow from financing activities was an inflow of million for the year ended december   as compared to an inflow of million for the same period in the decrease in cash inflow of million from financing activities was primarily a result of i net proceeds of million of our senior notes due issued in february  net proceeds of million of our senior notes due issued in october and million of our senior notes due issued in november  ii net proceeds of million from our common stock issued through our equity shelf program in compared to million in offsetting these decreases were i approximately million payment in related to the a repayment of million during the first quarter of of debt assumed as part of the december  capitalsource acquisition  b tender offer payment of our outstanding million senior notes due in november and c payoff of million gecc term loan in october  ii increase in dividend payments of million due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding and dividends per share in compared to  iii million redemption of our preferred stock through the use of our prior credit facility in  and vi in  we paid million related to deferred financing costs and refinancing costs primarily associated with the a issuance of our million senior notes due in february and the credit facility in april  b issuance of our million senior notes due in october and our million senior notes due in november and c prepayment penalty premium of million for paying off million gecc term loan prior to its maturity and approximately million penalty payment associated with the tender offer of our outstanding million senior notes due  compared to million we paid in and v million repurchase of our common stock in under our million stock repurchase program 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified four significant accounting policies that we believe are critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant assumptions  judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the four critical accounting policies are revenue recognition we have various different investments that generate revenue  including leased and mortgaged properties  as well as  other investments  including working capital loans 
we recognized rental income and mortgage interest income and other investment income as earned over the terms of the related master leases and notes  respectively 
substantially all of our leases contain provisions for specified annual increases over the rents of the prior year and are generally computed in one of three methods depending on specific provisions of each lease as follows i a specific annual increase over the prior year s rent  generally between and  ii an increase based on the change in pre determined formulas from year to year ie  such as increases in the cpi  or iii specific dollar increases over prior years 
revenue under lease arrangements with fixed and determinable increases is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight line basis 
the authoritative guidance does not provide for the recognition of contingent revenue until all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
we consider the operating history of the lessee  the payment history  the general condition of the industry and various other factors when evaluating whether all possible contingencies have been eliminated 
we do not include contingent rents as income until the contingencies are resolved 
in the case of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis  we generally record reserves against earned revenues from leases when collection becomes questionable or when negotiations for restructurings of troubled operators result in significant uncertainty regarding ultimate collection 
the amount of the reserve is estimated based on what management believes will likely be collected 
we continually evaluate the collectability of our straight line rent assets 
if it appears that we will not collect future rent due under our leases  we will record a provision for loss related to the straight line rent asset 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized in accordance with the authoritative guidance for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in the guidance related to the terms of the transactions and any continuing involvement associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
nursing home revenues of owned and operated assets consist of long term care revenues  rehabilitation therapy services revenues  temporary medical staffing services revenues and other ancillary services revenues 
the revenues are recognized as services are provided 
revenues are recorded net of provisions for discount arrangements with commercial payors and contractual allowances with third party payors  primarily medicare and medicaid 
revenues realizable under third party payor agreements are subject to change due to examination and retroactive adjustment 
estimated third party payor settlements are recorded in the period the related services are rendered 
the methods of making such estimates are reviewed periodically  and differences between the net amounts accrued and subsequent settlements or estimates of expected settlements are reflected in the current period results of operations 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
for additional information  see note owned and operated assets 
depreciation and asset impairment under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years for buildings and improvements and three to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
management periodically  but not less than annually  evaluates our real estate investments for impairment indicators  including the evaluation of our assets useful lives 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as  but not limited to  market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if indicators of impairment are present  management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities 
provisions for impairment losses related to long lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are determined to be permanently less than the carrying values of the assets 
an adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the leased properties and other long lived assets for the excess of historical cost over fair value 
the fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
all impairments are taken as a period cost at that time  and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties  and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively 
the impairments are primarily the result of closing facilities or updating the estimated proceeds we expect for the sale of closed facilities 
loan impairment management  periodically but not less than annually  evaluates our outstanding loans and notes receivable 
when management identifies potential loan impairment indicators  such as non payment under the loan documents  impairment of the underlying collateral  financial difficulty of the operator or other circumstances that may impair full execution of the loan documents  and management believes it is probable that all amounts will not be collected under the contractual terms of the loan  the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows 
in cases where expected future cash flows are not readily determinable  the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral 
the fair value of the loan is determined by market research  which includes valuing the property as a nursing home as well as other alternative uses 
we account for impaired loans using a the cost recovery method  and or b the cash basis method 
we generally utilize the cost recovery method for impaired loans for which impairment reserves were recorded 
we utilize the cash basis method for impairment loans for which no impairment reserves were recorded because the net present value of the discounted cash flows and or the underlying collateral supporting the loan were equal to or exceeded the book value of the loans 
under the cost recovery method  we apply cash received against the outstanding loan balance prior to recording interest income 
under the cash basis method  we apply cash received to interest income 
as of december  and  we had loan loss reserve totaling million and million  respectively 
in  we recorded provisions for loan losses of million 
in and we did not record provisions for loan losses or charge offs related to our mortgage or note receivable portfolios 
for additional information see note mortgage notes receivable and note other investments 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations the operating results of specified real estate assets that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for disposition  are reflected as assets held for sale in our balance sheet 
assets that qualify as held for sale may also be considered as a discontinued operation if  a the operation and cash flows of the asset have been or will be eliminated from future operations and b we will not have significant involvement with the asset after its disposition 
for assets that qualify as discontinued operations  we have reclassified the operations of those assets to discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented and assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
we had six facilities and one parcel of land classified as held for sale as of december  with a net book value of million 
the assets were not classified as discontinued operations 
we had one asset held for sale as of december  with a net book value of million 
the asset was not classified as discontinued operations 
we had two assets held for sale as of december  with a net book value of million neither of which were classified as discontinued operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the following disclosures of estimated fair value of financial instruments are subjective in nature and are dependent on a number of important assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows  risks  discount rates and relevant comparable market information associated with each financial instrument 
readers are cautioned that many of the statements contained in these paragraphs are forward looking and should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading forward looking statements  reimbursement issues and other factors affecting future results set forth above 
the use of different market assumptions and estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the reported estimated fair value amounts 
accordingly  the estimates presented below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts we would realize in a current market exchange 
mortgage notes receivable the fair value of mortgage notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
notes receivable the fair value of notes receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities 
borrowings under variable rate agreements our variable rate debt as of december  includes our credit facility 
the fair value of our borrowings under variable rate agreements is estimated using an expected present value technique based on expected cash flows discounted using the current credit adjusted risk free rate 
senior unsecured notes the fair value of the senior unsecured notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current borrowing rate available for the similar debt 
the market value of our long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages is subject to interest rate risks 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately billion 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million at december  the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was approximately billion 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million at december  while we currently do not engage in hedging strategies  we may engage in such strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies
