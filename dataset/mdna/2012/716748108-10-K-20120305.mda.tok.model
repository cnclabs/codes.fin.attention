item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview petroquest energy  inc is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the state of delaware with operations in oklahoma  texas  the gulf coast basin  arkansas and wyoming 
we seek to grow our production  proved reserves  cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration  development and acquisition activities 
from the commencement of our operations in through  we were focused exclusively in the gulf coast basin with onshore properties principally in southern louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico shelf 
during  we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties 
as part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile  we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects  shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins 
we have successfully diversified into onshore  longer life basins in oklahoma  arkansas  wyoming and texas through a combination of selective acquisitions and drilling activity 
beginning in with our acquisition of the carthage field in texas through  we have invested approximately million into growing our longer life assets 
during the eight year period ended december   we have realized a drilling success rate on gross wells drilled 
comparing metrics with those in  the year we implemented our diversification strategy  we have grown production by and estimated proved reserves by 
at december   of our estimated proved reserves and of our production were derived from our longer life assets 
during late  in response to declining commodity prices and the global financial crisis  we shifted our focus from increasing reserves and production to building liquidity and strengthening our balance sheet 
because of our significant operational control  we were able to reduce our capital expenditures from million in to million in thus allowing us to utilize our cash flow from operations  combined with proceeds from an equity offering  to repay million of bank debt 
while we achieved our goal of strengthening the financial position of the company  because of the reduced capital investments during  our production declined by during during and  we refocused on the key elements of our business strategy with the goal of growing reserves and production in a fiscally prudent manner 
in order to maintain our financial flexibility  we funded our capital expenditures budget with cash flow from operations  cash on hand and additional proceeds received under the woodford joint development agreement see liquidity and capital resources source of capital joint ventures 
as a result of our increased investments during and  our estimated proved reserves as of december  increased from production in the fourth quarter of was higher than production in the fourth quarter of during february  we amended our woodford shale joint development agreement jda to accelerate the entry into phase of the drilling program effective march  and modify the drilling carry ratio 
under the amended jda  the phase drilling carry has been expanded to provide for development in both the mississippian lime and the woodford shale plays whereby we will pay of the cost to drill and complete wells and receive a ownership interest 
the phase drilling carry totals approximately million and will be subject to extensions in one year intervals

critical accounting policies and estimates reserve estimates our estimates of proved oil and gas reserves constitute those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation 
at the end of each year  our proved reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
these estimates  however  represent projections based on geologic and engineering data 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and professional judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effect of regulations by governmental agencies  and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to the extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of such oil and gas properties 
disclosure requirements under staff accounting bulletin sab include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
companies also have the option to disclose probable and possible reserves in addition to the existing requirement to disclose proved reserves 
the disclosure requirements also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of third party preparers of reserves and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates 
pricing is based on a month average price using beginning of the month pricing during the month period prior to the ending date of the balance sheet to report oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  the month average is also used to measure ceiling test impairments and to compute depreciation  depletion and amortization 
full cost method of accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing oil and natural gas are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress and geological and geophysical service costs in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of oil and gas properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas 
the costs associated with unevaluated properties are not initially included in the amortization base and primarily relate to ongoing exploration activities  unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data and capitalized interest 
these costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
we compute the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs related to non producing reserves 
our depletion expense is affected by the estimates of future development costs  unevaluated costs and proved reserves  and changes in these estimates could have an impact on our future earnings 
we capitalize certain internal costs that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the capitalized internal costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related expenses and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we also capitalize a portion of the interest costs incurred on our debt 
capitalized interest is calculated using the amount of our unevaluated property and our effective borrowing rate 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges in place  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects the full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  the excess is charged to write down of oil and gas properties in the quarter in which the excess occurs 
as a result of lower natural gas prices and higher estimated future development costs  and their negative impact on certain of our longer lived estimated proved reserves and estimated future net cash flows  during the first and second quarters of  we recognized ceiling test write downs totaling million 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is probable that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from estimated proved oil and gas reserves will change in the near term 
if oil or gas prices decline  even for only a short period of time  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that further write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
future abandonment costs future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the timing of estimated costs  the impact of future inflation on current cost estimates and the political and regulatory environment 
derivative instruments the estimated fair values of our commodity derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet 
at inception  all of our commodity derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and gas production 
the changes in fair value of those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
if a hedge becomes ineffective because the hedged production does not occur  or the hedge otherwise does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in the income statement as derivative income or expense 
our hedges are specifically referenced to nymex prices 
we evaluate the effectiveness of our hedges at the time we enter the contracts  and periodically over the life of the contracts  by analyzing the correlation between nymex prices and the posted prices we receive from our designated production 
through this analysis  we are able to determine if a high correlation exists between the prices received for the designated production and the nymex prices at which the hedges will be settled 
at december   our derivative instruments were considered effective cash flow hedges 
estimating the fair value of derivative instruments requires valuation calculations incorporating estimates of future nymex prices  discount rates and price movements 
as a result  we calculate the fair value of our commodity derivatives using an independent third party s valuation model that utilizes market corroborated inputs that are observable over the term of the derivative contract 
our fair value calculations also incorporate an estimate of the counterparties default risk for derivative assets and an estimate of our default risk for derivative liabilities 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information with respect to our oil and gas operations for the years ended december   and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the fluctuations were as follows production total production decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the period 
however  total production in the fourth quarter of increased as compared to the third quarter of gas production during the year ended december  decreased less than one percent from the comparable period in the decrease in gas production was primarily the result of normal production declines in the gulf coast basin  offset by increases in gas production from our longer life basins 
as a result of continued drilling in our longer life basins  we expect our average daily gas production in to increase as compared to oil production during the twelve month period ended december  decreased from the comparable period 
the decrease in oil production is primarily the result of normal production declines in the gulf coast basin 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases due to the inception of production in the niobrara shale  where our first well began production in the fourth quarter of and three subsequent wells began production during  and in the eagle ford shale  where our first five wells began production in the third quarter of these niobrara and eagle ford shale wells represented of our total oil production during although we expect to increase oil production from drilling operations in the mississippian lime  the eagle ford shale and our la cantera prospect  such increase is not expected to completely offset normal declines in the gulf coast area 
as a result  we expect a small decrease in our average daily oil production during as compared to ngl production during the twelve months ended december  decreased from the comparable period due to the general decline in gulf coast gas production 
as a result of ongoing drilling in our texas  oklahoma and gulf coast assets  we expect our daily ngl production in to increase significantly as compared to prices including the effects of our hedges  average gas prices per mcf for the twelve months ended december  were as compared to for the period 
average oil prices per bbl for the twelve months ended december  were as compared to for the period

we capitalized  of interest during the twelve month period of  and  during the respective period 
the decrease in capitalized interest during the year ended december  was due to the sale of a portion of our unevaluated properties pursuant to the woodford joint development agreement during the second quarter of total interest costs were lower during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in as a result of the refinancing our senior notes due with our senior notes due in august in january  we recorded a gain relative to a  cash settlement received from a lawsuit filed by us in relating to disputed interests in certain oil and gas assets purchased in in addition to the cash proceeds received  we were assigned additional working interests in certain producing properties 
we recorded an additional  gain representing the estimated fair market value of those interests on the effective date of the settlement 
as a result of the early redemption of our senior notes due  we incurred a loss during the third quarter of totaling  approximately  of the loss related to non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and discount associated with the senior notes due income tax expense benefit during the twelve months ended december  totaled  as compared to  during the period 
we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs recognized during prior years  we incurred a cumulative three year loss 
because of the impact the cumulative loss has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax asset in prior periods 
during the third quarter of  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance as future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities were sufficient to realize the entire deferred tax asset and we had a net deferred tax liability of  at december  comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income loss available to common stockholders totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the primary fluctuations were as follows production total production decreased during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to the period 
gas production during the year ended december  decreased from the comparable period in the decrease in gas production was primarily the result of reduced capital spending during and normal production declines in the gulf coast area 
oil production during the twelve month period ended december  increased from the period due to the restoration of production at our ship shoal field after repairs and a recompletion following hurricanes katrina and rita 
in addition  our oil production rates increased from the drilling success of our turtle bayou prospect in and workovers at our ft

other expense during included an accrual for potential liabilities associated with certain pending legal matters 
during  other expense included  related to payments made in connection with a drilling rig contract 
because we elected to idle this drilling rig  there were no corresponding assets to record in connection with the fixed payments required under this contract  regardless of actual rig usage 
as a result  the costs were recorded as a component of other expense 
this contract expired during july other expense during also included  related to drill pipe inventory which was impaired to reflect the lower of cost or market

we provide for income taxes at a statutory rate of adjusted for permanent differences expected to be realized  primarily statutory depletion  non deductible stock compensation expenses and state income taxes 
as a result of the ceiling test write downs recognized during and  we incurred a cumulative three year loss 
as a result of this cumulative loss and the impact it has on the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets through future earnings  we established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we reduced the valuation allowance by  during the year ended december   the impact of which is included in our effective tax rate 
the valuation allowance was  as of december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our acquisition  exploration and development activities to date principally through cash flow from operations  bank borrowings  second lien term credit facilities  issuances of equity and debt securities  joint ventures and sales of assets 
at december   we had a working capital deficit of million compared to a surplus of million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of increased operational activities during as compared to  as we utilized a portion of our cash on hand to fund our capital expenditures in excess of our operational cash flow 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to many factors beyond our control such as weather  the overall condition of the global financial markets and economies  relatively minor changes in the outlook of supply and demand  and the actions of opec 
oil and natural gas prices have a significant impact on our cash flows available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce 
lower prices and or lower production may decrease revenues  cash flows and the borrowing base under the bank credit facility  thus reducing the amount of financial resources available to meet our capital requirements 
lower prices and reduced cash flow may also make it difficult to incur debt  including under our bank credit facility  because of the restrictive covenants in the indenture governing the notes 
see source of capital debt below 
our ability to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as oil and natural gas prices 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operations decreased from  during to  during the decrease in operating cash flow during as compared to was primarily attributable to cash received during the first quarter of in connection with a legal settlement and the impact of lower natural gas prices in source of capital debt on august   we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due the notes in a public offering 
the net proceeds of the offering  together with cash on hand  were used to fund our tender offer and consent solicitation and redemption of our senior notes due at december   the estimated fair value of the notes was million  based upon a market quote provided by an independent broker 
the notes have numerous covenants including restrictions on liens  incurrence of indebtedness  asset sales  dividend payments and other restricted payments 
interest is payable semi annually on march and september at december   million had been accrued in connection with the march  interest payment and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the notes 
we have a credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  wells fargo bank  na  capital one  na  iberiabank and whitney bank 
the credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility that permits borrowings based on the commitments of the lenders and the available borrowing base as determined in accordance with the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also allows us to use up to million of the borrowing base for letters of credit 
the credit facility matures on october  as of december  we had no borrowings outstanding under and no letters of credit issued pursuant to the credit agreement 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is based upon the valuation of the reserves attributable to our oil and gas properties as of january and july of each year 
the current borrowing base is million subject to the aggregate commitments of the lenders then in effect 
the aggregate commitments of the lenders is currently million and can be increased to up to million by either adding new lenders or increasing the commitments of existing lenders  subject to certain conditions 
the next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled to occur by march  we or the lenders may request two additional borrowing base redeterminations each year 
each time the borrowing base is to be re determined  the administrative agent under the credit agreement will propose a new borrowing base as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion  which must be approved by all lenders if the borrowing base is to be increased  or by lenders holding two thirds of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement if the borrowing base remains the same or is reduced 
the credit agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  including a lien on all equipment and at least of the aggregate total value of our oil and gas properties 
outstanding balances under the credit agreement bear interest at the alternate base rate abr plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on total commitments or the adjusted libo rate eurodollar plus a margin based on a sliding scale of to depending on total commitments 
the alternate base rate is equal to the highest of i the jpmorgan chase prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus or iii the adjusted libo rate plus 
for the purposes of the definition of alternative base rate only  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which dollar deposits of  with a one month maturity are offered by the principal london office of jpmorgan chase bank  na in immediately available funds in the london interbank market 
for all other purposes  the adjusted libo rate is equal to the rate at which eurodollar deposits in the london interbank market for one  two  three or six months as selected by us are quoted  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities 
outstanding letters of credit are charged a participation fee at a per annum rate equal to the margin applicable to eurodollar loans  a fronting fee and customary administrative fees 
in addition  we pay commitment fees based on a sliding scale of to depending on total commitments 
we are subject to certain restrictive financial covenants under the credit agreement  including a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitdax  determined on a rolling four quarter basis  of to and a minimum ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities of to  all as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes customary restrictions with respect to debt  liens  dividends  distributions and redemptions  investments  loans and advances  nature of business  international operations and foreign subsidiaries  leases  sale or discount of receivables  mergers or consolidations  sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  negative pledge agreements  gas imbalances and swap agreements 
however  the credit agreement permits us to repurchase up to million of our common stock during the term of the credit agreement  so long as after giving effect to such repurchase our liquidity as defined therein is greater than of the total commitments of the lenders at such time 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement 
source of capital issuance of securities during october  our shelf registration statement was declared effective  which allows us to publicly offer and sell up to million of any combination of debt securities  shares of common and preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
the registration statement does not provide any assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
source of capital divestitures we do not budget property divestitures  however  we are continuously evaluating our property base to determine if there are assets in our portfolio that no longer meet our strategic objectives 
from time to time we may divest certain non strategic assets in order to provide liquidity to strengthen our balance sheet or capital to be reinvested in higher rate of return projects 
we are currently exploring divestment opportunities for our wyoming and arkansas assets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell any of our assets in the future 
source of capital joint ventures in may  we entered into a joint development agreement with wsgp  a subsidiary of nextera energy resources  llc  whereby wsgp acquired approximately bcfe of our woodford proved undeveloped reserves as well as the right to earn of our undeveloped woodford acreage position through a two phase drilling program 
we received approximately million in cash at closing  net of million in transaction fees  and an additional million on november  in addition  since may  wsgp has funded a share of our drilling costs under a drilling program 
we achieved certain production performance metrics  as outlined in the joint development agreement  relative to the first wells drilled under the drilling program 
as a result  we received an additional million during december during february  we amended the joint development agreement with wsgp 
the amendment provides additional funding for a share of our drilling costs relative to our drilling programs in both our woodford shale and mississippian lime project areas 
wsgp will continue to earn of our undeveloped woodford shale acreage as they continue to fund a share of our drilling costs 
use of capital exploration and development our drilling capital budget  which includes capitalized interest and general and administrative costs  is expected to range between million and million 
we plan to fund our capital budget with cash flow from operations and cash on hand 
in addition  we could utilize available borrowings under the bank credit facility or proceeds from the sale of assets to fund a portion of our drilling budget 
use of capital acquisitions we do not budget acquisitions  however  we are continuously evaluating opportunities to expand our existing asset base or establish positions in new core areas 
during  we acquired acreage positions in the niobrara shale and the eagle ford shale 
in september  we acquired approximately  acres in pawnee county  oklahoma targeting the mississippian lime  and subsequently sold a interest in this acreage position for approximately million 
as of december   we had invested approximately million to acquire our  net acre position in the mississippian lime 
we plan to drill our first well in this oil play during the first quarter of during  we invested approximately million in leasehold acquisitions  which were funded through a combination of cash flow and cash on hand 
we expect to finance our future acquisition activities  if consummated  through cash on hand or available borrowings under our bank credit facility 
we may also utilize sales of equity or debt securities  sales of properties or assets or joint venture arrangements with industry partners  if necessary 
we cannot assure you that such additional financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience market risks primarily in two areas interest rates and commodity prices 
because all of our properties are located within the united states  we believe that our business operations are not exposed to significant market risks relating to foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
based on projected annual sales volumes for  a decline in the estimated average prices we expect to receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have an approximate million impact on our revenues 
we periodically seek to reduce our exposure to commodity price volatility by hedging a portion of production through commodity derivative instruments 
in the settlement of a typical hedge transaction  we will have the right to receive from the counterparties to the hedge  the excess of the fixed price specified in the hedge over a floating price based on a market index  multiplied by the quantity hedged 
if the floating price exceeds the fixed price  we are required to pay the counterparties this difference multiplied by the quantity hedged 
during  we received approximately million from the counterparties to our derivative instruments in connection with net hedge settlements 
we are required to pay the difference between the floating price and the fixed price when the floating price exceeds the fixed price regardless of whether we have sufficient production to cover the quantities specified in the hedge 
significant reductions in production at times when the floating price exceeds the fixed price could require us to make payments under the hedge agreements even though such payments are not offset by sales of production 
hedging will also prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or gas prices above the fixed amount specified in the hedge 
our credit agreement requires that the counterparties to our hedge contracts be lenders under the credit agreement or  if not a lender under the credit agreement  rated a a or higher by s p or moody s 
currently  the counterparties to our existing hedge contracts are jpmorgan chase bank and wells fargo bank  both of whom are lenders under the credit agreement 
to the extent we enter into additional hedge contracts  we would expect that certain of the lenders under the credit agreement would serve as counterparties 
as of december   we had entered into the following gas hedge contract accounted for as a cash flow hedge instrument weighted production period type daily volumes average price natural gas costless collar  mmbtu at december   we recognized an asset of approximately million related to the estimated fair value of this derivative instrument 
based on estimated future commodity prices as of december   we would realize a million gain  net of taxes  as an increase to oil and gas sales during the next months 
this gain is expected to be reclassified based on the schedule of oil and gas volumes stipulated in the derivative contracts 
during january  we entered into the following additional hedge contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges september  september  september  instrument weighted production period type daily volumes average price natural gas march october swap  mmbtu crude oil february december swap bbl after executing the above transactions  the company has approximately bcfe of gas volumes  with an average floor of per mcf  and approximately  barrels of oil volumes at per barrel  hedged for
