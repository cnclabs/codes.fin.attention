liquidity and capital resources the company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses and technologies  cash dividends and common stock repurchases 
cash provided from operations continues to be the company s primary source of funds 
the company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary 
the company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financial flexibility

due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
forward contracts forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments 
short term borrowings short term borrowings consist of commercial paper

management s use of non gaap measures net sales on a constant currency basis is a non gaap measure 
the company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales  the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the company s investors 
constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior year s local currency sales by the current period s exchange rate 
constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows 
the limitation of these non gaap measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis 
non gaap measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of gaap results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition generally  sales to end user customers and european distributors are recognized at the point of delivery  and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment 
in certain circumstances  end user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customer s location 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
share based compensation share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
generally  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date  the company utilizes a binomial model 
inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the expected stock price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options 
the company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility 
this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations 
with respect to expected future exercise behavior  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including  for example  product liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other ii 
table of contents commercial disputes  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
the company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and or costs related to claims  settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  the company accrues the minimum amount of the range 
the company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible 
amounts recovered under these policies may be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and or costs 
in addition  there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will be otherwise available 
legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and internationally 
the company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions 
these positions relate to transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions and other matters 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
the recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the company s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the reserves are used or reversed once the statutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and or liquidity but may be material to its income tax provision and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns the company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable  amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  the average length of time to collect receivables  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts 
in estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and other market related conditions 
the company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s results of operations and financial condition could be material in the period of change 
acquisitions in a business combination  the acquisition method of accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value  with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired 
ipr d is capitalized and recorded as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date  and transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for ipr d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility 
amounts allocated to ipr d are subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of a project 
upon successful completion  a ii 
table of contents separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the asset and amortization will begin 
when the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for as a business combination  no goodwill is recognized 
the judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact results of operations 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually at december or more frequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair value based test 
the company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units  each of which is one level below the company s single reporting segment 
the fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value 
in determining the fair value of each reporting unit  the company uses a weighted average combination of both market and income approaches 
the market approach to estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure 
the income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
impairment of long lived assets intangible assets with finite lives and other long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
the company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the british pound  the mexican peso  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the japanese yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
bard s risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at december  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million  and if the us dollar uniformly weakened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
the company s investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents  for which the market values are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
the market value of the company s fixed rate debt is affected by a change in the medium to long term us interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities 
the market value of the company s fixed rate debt including the effect of the related interest rate swap contract effectively converting the fixed rate notes to floating rate instruments approximated  million at december  a sensitivity analysis  assuming a basis point increase or decrease in us interest rates and assuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity  indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated million or  million  respectively  on december  ii
