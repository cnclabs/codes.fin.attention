item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  recent market conditions have heightened the need for most reits  including us  to continue to place an emphasis on financing and capital preservation strategies 
our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet are essential to the success of our business 
we intend to continue implementing our financing and capital strategies in a number of ways  including prudently managing our balance sheet  including reducing the aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility so that we have additional capacity available to fund our development and redevelopment projects and pay down maturing debt if refinancing that debt is not feasible  extending the maturity dates of and or refinancing of our near term mortgage  construction and other indebtedness 
subsequent to december   we retired million of our maturities  leaving million to be addressed over the balance of the year 
we are pursuing financing alternative to enable us to repay  refinance  or extend the maturity date of this loan  staggering our maturities with long term debt on recently completed projects  entering into construction loans typically prior to commencement of construction to fund our in process developments  redevelopments  and future developments  raising additional capital through the issuance of common shares  preferred shares or other securities  managing our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt through the use of fixed rate hedging transactions and securing property specific long term nonrecourse financing  and investing in joint venture arrangements in order to access less expensive capital and to mitigate risk 
business segments our principal business is the ownership  operation  acquisition and development of high quality neighborhood and community shopping centers in selected markets in the united states 
historically  the operations of the company have been aligned into two business segments real estate operations and development activities  and construction and advisory services 
over the last several years  the company made a strategic decision to reduce its third party construction and advisory services activity 
as a result of this decision  the company has not entered into any new significant construction or advisory contracts in the operations of this segment are de minimis for the year ended december   and the company expects they will remain so in the foreseeable future 
competition the united states commercial real estate market continues to be highly competitive 
we face competition from other reits and other owner operators engaged in the development  acquisition  ownership and leasing of shopping centers as well as from numerous local  regional and national real estate developers and owners in each of our markets 
some of these competitors may have greater capital resources than we do  although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market 
we face significant competition in our efforts to lease available space to prospective tenants at our operating  development and redevelopment properties 
the nature of the competition for tenants varies depending upon the characteristics of each local market in which we own and manage properties 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in attracting tenants in our market areas are location  demographics  rental rates  the presence of anchor stores  competitor shopping centers in the same geographic area and the maintenance  appearance  access and traffic patterns of our properties 
there can be no assurance in the future that we will be able to compete successfully with our competitors in our development  acquisition and leasing activities 
government regulation we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal  state  and local environmental  health  safety and similar laws including americans with disabilities act 
our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we believe our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada 
however  noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
environmental regulations 
some properties in our portfolio contain  may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations may have released  or have the potential to release  such substances into the environment 
in addition  some of our properties have tenants which may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses 
in general  these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances  if any  in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances 
however  these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent 
finally  one of our properties has contained asbestos containing building materials  or acbm  and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction 
environmental laws require that acbm be properly managed and maintained  and fines and penalties may be imposed on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
the laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
neither existing environmental  health  safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results operations  and management does not believe they will in the future 
in addition  we have not incurred  and do not expect to incur  any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past 
however  we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  and rental loss insurance that covers all properties in our portfolio 
we believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss  the cost of the coverage  and industry practice 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god  and  in some cases  flooding 
some of our policies  such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover losses

item a 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time 
these factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows  and you should carefully consider them 
it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors 
you should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
we have separated the risks into three categories risks related to our operations  risks related to our organization and structure  and risks related to tax matters 
risks related to our operations because of our geographical concentration in indiana  florida and texas  a prolonged economic downturn in these states could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the united states economy was in a recession during and for a portion of similarly  the specific markets in which we operate continue to face challenging economic conditions that could persist into the future 
in particular  as of december   of our owned square footage and total annualized base rent was located in indiana  of our owned square footage and total annualized base rent was located in florida  and of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent was located in texas 
this level of concentration could expose us to greater economic risks than if we owned properties in numerous geographic regions 
many states continue to deal with state fiscal budget shortfalls  high unemployment rates and home foreclosure rates 
continued adverse economic or real estate trends in indiana  florida  texas  or the surrounding regions  or any continued decrease in demand for retail space resulting from the local regulatory environment  business climate or fiscal problems in these states  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders 
severe disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing for development of our properties and other purposes on reasonable terms  or at all  and have other material adverse effects on our business 
disruptions in the credit markets generally  or relating to the real estate industry specifically  may adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing at favorable rates or at all 
in and  the united states financial and credit markets experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which caused market prices of many financial instruments to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably 
those circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets  making terms for certain financings less attractive  and in some cases resulted in the unavailability of financing 
although the credit markets have recovered from this severe dislocation  there are a number of continuing effects  including a weakening of many traditional sources of debt financing  a reduction in the overall amount of debt financing available  lower loan to value ratios  a tightening of lender underwriting standards and terms and higher interest rate spreads 
as a result  we may be unable to refinance or extend our existing indebtedness or the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of our existing indebtedness 
for example  as of january   we had approximately million and million of debt maturing in and  respectively 
if we are not successful in refinancing our outstanding debt when it becomes due  we may be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might adversely affect our ability to service other debt and to meet our other obligations 
if a dislocation similar to that which occurred in and occurs in the future  we may be forced to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and have to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain permanent financing on development projects we financed with construction loans 
our inability to obtain such permanent financing on favorable terms  if at all  could delay the completion of our development projects and or cause us to incur additional capital costs in connection with completing such projects  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to execute our business strategy 
these events also may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common shares and other adverse effects on our business 
if our tenants are unable to secure financing necessary to continue to operate their businesses and pay us rent  we could be materially and adversely affected 
many of our tenants rely on external sources of financing to operate their businesses 
as discussed above  there are a number of continuing effects of the disruptions experienced in the united states financial and credit markets in and if our tenants are unable to secure financing necessary to continue to operate their businesses  they may be unable to meet their rent obligations to us or enter into new leases with us or be forced to declare bankruptcy and reject our leases  which could materially and adversely affect us 
ongoing challenging conditions in the united states and global economy  and the challenges facing our retail tenants and non owned anchor tenants may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are susceptible to adverse economic developments in the united states 
the united states economy is still experiencing weakness from the recent recession  which resulted in increased unemployment  the bankruptcy or weakened financial condition of a number of retailers  decreased consumer spending  increased home foreclosures  low consumer confidence  a decline in residential and commercial property values and reduced demand and rental rates for retail space 
although the united states economy appears to have emerged from the recent recession  market conditions remain challenging as high levels of unemployment and low consumer confidence have persisted 
there can be no assurance that the recovery will continue 
general economic factors that are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  recessions  decreases in consumer confidence  reductions in consumer credit availability  increasing consumer debt levels  rising energy costs  tax rates  continued business layoffs  downsizing and industry slowdowns  and or rising inflation  could have a negative impact on the business of our retail tenants 
in turn  this could have a material adverse effect on our business because current or prospective tenants may  among other things i have difficulty paying us rent as they struggle to sell goods and services to consumers  ii be unwilling to enter into or renew leases with us on favorable terms or at all  iii seek to terminate their existing leases with us or seek downward rental adjustment to such leases  or iv be forced to curtail operations or declare bankruptcy 
we are also susceptible to other developments that  while not directly tied to the economy  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
these developments include relocations of businesses  changing demographics  increased internet shopping  infrastructure quality  federal  state  and local budgetary constraints and priorities  increases in real estate and other taxes  costs of complying with government regulations or increased regulation  decreasing valuations of real estate  and other factors 
further  we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying value of our real estate assets may not be recoverable 
the ongoing challenging market conditions could require us to recognize an impairment charge  with respect to one or more of our properties  or a loss on disposition of one or more of our properties 
our business is significantly influenced by demand for retail space generally  and a decrease in such demand may have a greater adverse effect on our business than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
because our portfolio of properties consists primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers  a decrease in the demand for retail space  due to the economic factors discussed above or otherwise  may have a greater adverse effect on our business and financial condition than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
the market for retail space has been  and could continue to be  adversely affected by weakness in the national  regional and local economies  the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies  the ongoing consolidation in the retail sector  the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets  and increasing consumer purchases through the internet 
to the extent that any of these conditions occur  they are likely to negatively affect market rents for retail space and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  the trading price of our common shares and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders 
failure by any major tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us  because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
our leases generally do not contain provisions designed to ensure the creditworthiness of our tenants 
at any time  our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition  particularly during periods of economic uncertainty such as what has recently occurred 
for example  sears holdings  which leases  square feet and accounts for of our annualized base rent has recently announced it is closing stores 
the store in our center is not one of those identified by sears for closure  however  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
in the event of a prolonged economic downturn  our tenants may delay lease commencements  decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration  fail to make rental payments when due  close a number of stores or declare bankruptcy 
any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenant s leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases 
in addition  lease terminations by a major tenant or non owned anchor or a failure by that major tenant or non owned anchor to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers because of contractual co tenancy termination or rent reduction rights under the terms of some leases 
in that event  we may be unable to re lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all 
the occurrence of any of the situations described above  particularly if it involves a substantial tenant or a non owned anchor with ground leases in multiple locations  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
as of december   the five largest tenants in our operating portfolio in terms of annualized base rent were publix  bed bath beyond buy buy baby  petsmart  ross stores and toys r us  representing     and  respectively  of our total annualized base rent 
we face potential material adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies  and we may be unable to collect balances due from any tenant in bankruptcy or replace the tenant at current rates  or at all 
bankruptcy filings by our retail tenants occur from time to time 
such bankruptcies may increase in times of economic uncertainty such as what has recently occurred 
we cannot make any assurance that any tenant who files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay us rent 
a bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant or the lease guarantor  or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold from a tenant in bankruptcy  which would result in a reduction in our cash flow and in the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 
moreover  we are continually re leasing vacant spaces resulting from tenant lease terminations 
the bankruptcy of a tenant  particularly an anchor tenant  may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties 
future tenant bankruptcies could materially adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy 
we had million of consolidated indebtedness outstanding as of december   which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and reduce our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund our growth 
required repayments of debt and related interest may materially adversely affect our operating performance 
we had million of consolidated outstanding indebtedness as of december   of which million is scheduled to mature in  and million is scheduled to mature in along with our share of mortgage debt of unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
at december   million of our debt bore interest at variable rates million when reduced by our million of fixed interest rate swaps along with our share of mortgage debt of unconsolidated joint ventures of million 
interest rates are currently low relative to historical levels and may increase significantly in the future 
if our interest expense increased significantly  it could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt outstanding  net of cash flow hedges  as of december  increased by  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future cash flows by million annually 
we also intend to incur additional debt in connection with various development and redevelopment projects  and may incur additional debt with acquisitions of properties 
our organizational documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
we may borrow new funds to develop or acquire properties 
in addition  we may incur or increase our mortgage debt by obtaining loans secured by some or all of the real estate properties we develop or acquire 
we also may borrow funds if necessary to satisfy the requirement that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income  or otherwise as is necessary or advisable to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes or otherwise avoid paying taxes that can be eliminated through distributions to our shareholders 
our substantial debt could materially and adversely affect our business in other ways  including by  among other things requiring us to use a substantial portion of our funds from operations to pay principal and interest  which reduces the amount available for distributions  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  making us more vulnerable to economic and industry downturns and reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions  and limiting our ability to borrow more money for operating or capital needs or to finance development and acquisitions in the future 
agreements with lenders supporting our unsecured revolving credit facility and various other loan agreements contain default provisions which  among other things  could result in the acceleration of principal and interest payments or the termination of the facilities 
our unsecured revolving credit facility and various other debt agreements contain certain events of default which include  but are not limited to  failure to make principal or interest payments when due  failure to perform or observe any term in the agreement  covenant or condition contained in the agreements  failure to maintain certain financial and operating ratios and other criteria  misrepresentations and bankruptcy proceedings 
in the event of a default under any of these agreements  the lender would have various rights including  but not limited to  the ability to require the acceleration of the payment of all principal and interest due and or to terminate the agreements  and to foreclose on the properties 
the declaration of a default and or the acceleration of the amount due under any such credit agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  certain of our fixed rate and variable rate loans contain cross default provisions which provide that a violation by the company of any financial covenant set forth in our unsecured revolving credit facility agreement will constitute an event of default under the loans  which could allow the lending institutions to accelerate the amount due under the loans 
mortgage debt obligations expose us to the possibility of foreclosure  which could result in the loss of our investment in a property or group of properties subject to mortgage debt 
a significant amount of our indebtedness is secured by our real estate assets 
if a property or group of properties is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage or lender could foreclose on the property  resulting in the loss of our investment 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure  but we would not receive any cash proceeds  which could hinder our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements imposed by the internal revenue code 
if any of our properties are foreclosed on due to a default  our ability to pay cash distributions to our shareholders and our earnings will be limited 
we are subject to risks associated with hedging agreements 
we use a combination of interest rate protection agreements  including interest rate swaps  to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility 
this may expose us to additional risks  including a risk that counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations 
developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
further  should we choose to terminate a hedging agreement  there could be significant costs and cash requirements involved to fulfill our initial obligation under the hedging agreement 
a substantial number of common shares eligible for future sale could cause our common share price to decline significantly 
if our shareholders sell  or the market perceives that our shareholders intend to sell  substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market  the market price of our common shares could decline significantly 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had outstanding  common shares 
of these shares   are freely tradable with the remainder held generally by our affiliates  as that term is defined by rule under the securities act 
in addition   units of our operating partnership are owned by our executive officers and other individuals  and are redeemable by the holder for cash or  at our election  common shares 
pursuant to registration rights of certain of our executive officers and other individuals  we filed a registration statement with the sec in august to register  common shares issued or issuable upon redemption of units in our operating partnership in our formation transactions 
as units are redeemed for common shares  the market price of our common shares could drop significantly if the holders of such shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
our performance and value are subject to risks associated with real estate assets and with the real estate industry 
our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate substantial revenues from our properties 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates or declining demand for real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur  could result in a general decline in rents or an increased incidence of defaults under existing leases 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  per share trading price of our common shares and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make distributions to our shareholders 
in addition  other events and conditions generally applicable to owners and operators of real property that are beyond our control may decrease cash available for distribution and the value of our properties 
these events include but are not limited to adverse changes in the national  regional and local economic climate  particularly in indiana  where of our owned square footage and total annualized base rent is located  florida  where of our owned square footage and total annualized base rent is located  and texas  where of our owned square footage and of our total annualized base rent is located  tenant bankruptcies  local oversupply of rental space  increased competition or reduction in demand for rentable space  inability to collect rent from tenants  or having to provide significant rent concessions to tenants  vacancies or our inability to rent space on favorable terms  changes in market rental rates  inability to finance property development  tenant improvements and acquisitions on favorable terms  increased operating costs  including costs incurred for maintenance  insurance premiums  utilities and real estate taxes  the need to periodically fund the costs to repair  renovate and re lease space  decreased attractiveness of our properties to tenants  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses such as snow removal costs  costs of complying with changes in governmental regulations  including those governing usage  zoning  the environment and taxes  civil unrest  acts of terrorism  earthquakes  hurricanes and other national disasters or acts of god that may result in underinsured or uninsured losses  the relative illiquidity of real estate investments  changing demographics  and changing traffic patterns 
our financial covenants may restrict our operating and acquisition activities 
our unsecured revolving credit facility contains certain financial and operating covenants  including  among other things  certain coverage ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt  make dividend payments  sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions 
these covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions 
in addition  certain of our mortgages contain customary covenants which  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property  to enter into new leases or materially modify existing leases  and to discontinue insurance coverage 
failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
our current and future joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as of december   we owned six of our operating properties through joint ventures 
as of december   the six properties represented of our annualized base rent 
in addition  one of our in process development projects and one of our future development projects are currently owned through joint ventures  one of which is accounted for under the equity method as of december  as we do not exercise requisite control for consolidation treatment 
our joint ventures involve risks not present with respect to our wholly owned properties  including the following we may share decision making authority with our joint venture partners regarding certain major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture property  such as the sale of the property or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the property  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the property that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of the property  disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved  and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments and the activities of a joint venture could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit  even though we may not control the joint venture 
in the future  we may seek to co invest with third parties through joint ventures that may involve similar or additional risks 
we face significant competition  which may impede our ability to renew leases or re lease space as leases expire or require us to undertake unbudgeted capital improvements 
we compete with numerous developers  owners and operators of retail shopping centers for tenants 
these competitors include institutional investors  other reits and other owner operators of community and neighborhood shopping centers  some of which own or may in the future own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located  but which have greater capital resources 
as of december   leases were scheduled to expire on a total of of the space at our properties in if our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates  or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants  we may be unable to lease on satisfactory terms to potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain tenants when our leases with them expire 
we also may be required to offer more substantial rent abatements  tenant improvements and early termination rights or accommodate requests for renovations  build to suit remodeling and other improvements than we have historically 
as a result  our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  trading price of our common shares and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our shareholders may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  increased competition for tenants may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise planned to make 
any capital improvements we undertake may reduce cash available for distributions to shareholders 
our future developments and acquisitions may not yield the returns we expect or may result in dilution in shareholder value 
we have five in process development redevelopment projects and six future development redevelopment projects 
new development projects and property acquisitions are subject to a number of risks  including  but not limited to abandonment of development activities after expending resources to determine feasibility  construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition  and any representations we may receive from the seller  may fail to reveal various liabilities or defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired  which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition costs  as a result of competition for attractive development and acquisition opportunities  we may be unable to acquire assets as we desire or the purchase price may be significantly elevated  which may impede our growth  financing risks  the failure to meet anticipated occupancy or rent levels  failure to receive required zoning  occupancy  land use and other governmental permits and authorizations and changes in applicable zoning and land use laws  and the consent of third parties such as tenants  mortgage lenders and joint venture partners may be required  and those consents may be difficult to obtain or could be withheld 
in addition  if a project is delayed or if we are unable to lease designated space to anchor tenants  certain tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
if any of these situations occur  development costs for a project will increase  which will result in reduced returns  or even losses  from such investments 
in deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property  we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property 
if these new properties do not perform as expected  our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected or an impairment charge could occur 
in addition  the issuance of equity securities as consideration for any acquisitions could be dilutive to our shareholders 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisitions or development and redevelopment projects that meet our investment criteria  which may impede our growth 
part of our business strategy is expansion through acquisitions and development and redevelopment projects  which requires us to identify suitable development or acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet our development or acquisition criteria  or we may fail to complete developments  acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
failure to identify or complete developments or acquisitions could slow our growth  which could in turn materially adversely affect our operations 
redevelopment activities may be delayed or otherwise may not perform as expected and  in the case of an unsuccessful redevelopment project  our entire investment could be at risk for loss 
we currently have two in process redevelopment projects and three future redevelopment projects 
we expect to redevelop certain of our other properties in the future 
in connection with any redevelopment of our properties  we will bear certain risks  including the risk of construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs and make a project uneconomical  the risk that occupancy or rental rates at a completed project will not be sufficient to enable us to pay operating expenses or earn the targeted rate of return on investment  and the risk of incurrence of predevelopment costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
in addition  various tenants may have the right to withdraw from a property if a development and or redevelopment project is not completed on time 
in the case of a redevelopment project  consents may be required from various tenants in order to redevelop a center 
in the case of an unsuccessful redevelopment project  our entire investment could be at risk for loss or an impairment charge could occur 
we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate and could  under certain circumstances  be required to pay certain tax indemnities related to the properties we sell 
real estate property investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
our ability to dispose of properties on advantageous terms depends on factors beyond our control  including competition from other sellers and the availability of attractive financing for potential buyers of our properties  and we cannot predict the various market conditions affecting real estate investments that will exist at any particular time in the future 
in addition  in connection with our formation at the time of our initial public offering ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners of our operating partnership 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to the built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represented of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza shopping center  thirty south and market street village 
we also agreed to limit the aggregate gain certain limited partners of our operating partnership would recognize  with respect to certain other contributed properties through december   to not more than million in total  with certain annual limits  unless we reimburse them for the taxes attributable to the excess gain and any taxes imposed on the reimbursement payments  and take certain other steps to help them avoid incurring taxes that were deferred in connection with the formation transactions 
the agreement described above is extremely complicated and imposes a number of procedural requirements on us  which makes it more difficult for us to ensure that we comply with all of the various terms of the agreement and therefore creates a greater risk that we may be required to make an indemnity payment 
the complicated nature of this agreement also might adversely impact our ability to pursue other transactions  including certain kinds of strategic transactions and reorganizations 
also  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to adjust our portfolio mix promptly in response to market conditions  which may adversely affect our financial position 
in addition  we will be subject to income taxes on gains from the sale of any properties owned by any taxable reit subsidiary 
potential losses may not be covered by insurance 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsurable losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god  and  in some cases  flooding 
some of our policies  such as those covering losses due to terrorism and floods  are insured subject to limitations involving large deductibles or co payments and policy limits that may not be sufficient to cover all losses 
if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits  we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
insurance coverage on our properties may be expensive or difficult to obtain  exposing us to potential risk of loss 
in the future  we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices 
in addition  insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses  such as losses due to terrorist acts  environmental liabilities  or other catastrophic events including hurricanes and floods  or  if offered  the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified 
we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses and or there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available 
if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property after a covered period of time  but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future 
if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could seriously disrupt our operations  delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property 
events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 
rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions  particularly if such expenses are not offset by corresponding revenues 
our existing properties and any properties we develop or acquire in the future are and will be subject to operating risks common to real estate in general  any or all of which may negatively affect us 
the expenses of owning and operating properties generally do not decrease  and may increase  when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties 
as a result  if any property is not fully occupied or if rents are being paid in an amount that is insufficient to cover operating expenses  we could be required to expend funds for that property s operating expenses 
our properties continue to be subject to increases in real estate and other tax rates  utility costs  operating expenses  insurance costs  repairs and maintenance and administrative expenses  regardless of such properties occupancy rates 
therefore  rising operating expenses could reduce our cash flow and funds available for future distributions  particularly if such expenses are not offset by corresponding revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to government regulation and environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with contamination 
the cost of investigation  remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial  and the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
in connection with the ownership  operation and management of real properties  we are potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other related costs  including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property 
we may also be liable to third parties for damage and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate 
environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination 
moreover  if contamination is discovered on our properties  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property may be used or how businesses may be operated on that property 
some of the properties in our portfolio contain  may have contained or are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks for petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances 
these operations may have released  or have the potential to release  such substances into the environment 
in addition  some of our properties have tenants that may use hazardous or toxic substances in the routine course of their businesses 
in general  these tenants have covenanted in their leases with us to use these substances  if any  in compliance with all environmental laws and have agreed to indemnify us for any damages that we may suffer as a result of their use of such substances 
however  these lease provisions may not fully protect us in the event that a tenant becomes insolvent 
finally  one of our properties has contained asbestos containing building materials  or acbm  and another property may have contained such materials based on the date of its construction 
environmental laws require that acbm be properly managed and maintained  and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
the laws also may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers 
our properties must also comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance  any of which could adversely affect our financial condition 
our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful 
we test our properties for compliance with applicable environmental laws on a limited basis 
we cannot give assurance that existing environmental studies with respect to our properties reveal all potential environmental liabilities  any previous owner  occupant or tenant of one of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us  the current environmental condition of our properties will not be affected by tenants and occupants  by the condition of nearby properties  or by other unrelated third parties  or future uses or conditions including  without limitation  changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof will not result in environmental liabilities 
inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
most of our leases contain provisions requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  to the extent we are able to recover such costs from our tenants 
however  increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses  as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents 
also  inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases or limits on such tenant s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses  which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time  and limit our ability to recover all of our operating expenses 
inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending  which could impact our tenants sales and  in turn  our average rents  and in some cases  our percentage rents  where applicable 
in addition  renewals of leases or future leases may not be negotiated on current terms  in which event we may have to pay a greater percentage or all of our operating expenses 
our share price could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial or complete loss on our shareholders investment 
the stock markets including the new york stock exchange  or the nyse  on which we list our common and preferred shares have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our common and preferred shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in our shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication by securities analysts of research reports about us or our industry  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  increase or decrease in dividends  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
moreover  an active trading market on the nyse for our series a preferred shares that were issued in december may not develop or  if it does develop  may not last  in which case the trading price of our series a preferred shares could be adversely affected 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
holders of our series a preferred shares have extremely limited voting rights 
holders of our series a preferred shares have extremely limited voting rights 
our common shares are the only class of our equity securities carrying full voting rights 
voting rights for holders of series a preferred shares exist primarily with respect to the ability to appoint additional trustees to our board of trustees in the event that six quarterly dividends whether or not consecutive payable on our series a preferred shares are in arrears  and with respect to voting on amendments to our declaration of trust or our series a preferred shares articles supplementary that materially and adversely affect the rights of series a preferred shares holders or create additional classes or series of preferred shares that are senior to our series a preferred shares 
other than very limited circumstances  holders of our series a preferred shares will not have voting rights 
risks related to our organization and structure our organizational documents contain provisions that generally would prohibit any person other than members of the kite family who  as a group  are currently allowed to own up to of our outstanding common shares from beneficially owning more than of our outstanding common shares or up to in the case of certain designated investment entities  as defined in our declaration of trust  which may discourage third parties from conducting a tender offer or seeking other change of control transactions that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise benefit our shareholders 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may have an anti takeover effect and inhibit a change in our management 
there are ownership limits and restrictions on transferability in our declaration of trust 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year 
to make sure that we will not fail to satisfy this requirement and for anti takeover reasons  our declaration of trust generally prohibits any shareholder other than an excepted holder or certain designated investment entities  as defined in our declaration of trust from owning actually  constructively or by attribution  more than of the value or number of our outstanding common shares 
our declaration of trust provides an excepted holder limit that allows members of the kite family al kite  john kite and paul kite  their family members and certain entities controlled by one or more of the kites  as a group  to own more than of our outstanding common shares  so long as  under the applicable tax attribution rules  no one excepted holder treated as an individual would hold more than of our common shares  no two excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  no three excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  no four excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares  and no five excepted holders treated as individuals would own more than of our common shares 
currently  one of the excepted holders would be attributed all of the common shares owned by each other excepted holder and  accordingly  the excepted holders as a group would not be allowed to own in excess of of our common shares 
if at a later time  there were not one excepted holder that would be attributed all of the shares owned by the excepted holders as a group  the excepted holder limit would not permit each excepted holder to own of our common shares 
rather  the excepted holder limit would prevent two or more excepted holders who are treated as individuals under the applicable tax attribution rules from owning a higher percentage of our common shares than the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one excepted holder  plus the maximum amount of common shares that could be owned by any one or more other individual common shareholders who are not excepted holders 
certain entities that are defined as designated investment entities in our declaration of trust  which generally includes pension funds  mutual funds  and certain investment management companies  are permitted to own up to of our outstanding common shares  so long as each beneficial owner of the shares owned by such designated investment entity would satisfy the ownership limit if those beneficial owners owned directly their proportionate share of the common shares owned by the designated investment entity 
our board of trustees may waive  and has waived in the past  the ownership limit or the designated investment entity limit for a shareholder that is not an individual if such shareholder provides information and makes representations to the board that are satisfactory to the board  in its reasonable discretion  to establish that such person s ownership in excess of the limit or the limit  as applicable  would not jeopardize our qualification as a reit 
in addition  our declaration of trust contains certain other ownership restrictions intended to prevent us from earning income from related parties if such income would cause us to fail to comply with the reit gross income requirements 
the various ownership restrictions may discourage a tender offer or other transactions or a change in management or control that might involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders  or compel a shareholder who has acquired our shares in excess of these ownership limitations to dispose of the additional shares and  as a result  to forfeit the benefits of owning the additional shares 
any acquisition of our common shares in violation of these ownership restrictions will be void ab initio and will result in automatic transfers of our common shares to a charitable trust  which will be responsible for selling the common shares to permitted transferees and distributing at least a portion of the proceeds to the prohibited transferees 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by our board 
thus  our board could authorize the issuance of additional preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of some or a majority of our shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of our shares 
in addition  any preferred shares that we issue likely would rank senior to our common shares with respect to payment of distributions  in which case we could not pay any distributions on our common shares until full distributions were paid with respect to such preferred shares 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or the removal of existing management and  as a result  could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and our board of trustees power to reclassify shares and issue additional common shares or preferred shares and the absence of cumulative voting rights 
certain provisions of maryland law could inhibit changes in control 
certain provisions of maryland law may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common shares with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares  including business combination moratorium fair price provisions that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations between us and an interested shareholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of our shares or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and thereafter imposes stringent fair price and super majority shareholder voting requirements on these combinations  and control share provisions that provide that control shares of our company defined as shares which  when aggregated with other shares controlled by the shareholder  entitle the shareholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares from a party other than the issuer have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding all interested shares  and are subject to redemption in certain circumstances 
we have opted out of these provisions of maryland law 
however  our board of trustees may opt to make these provisions applicable to us at any time 
certain officers and trustees may have interests that conflict with the interests of shareholders 
certain of our officers and members of our board of trustees own limited partner units in our operating partnership 
these individuals may have personal interests that conflict with the interests of our shareholders with respect to business decisions affecting us and our operating partnership  such as interests in the timing and pricing of property sales or refinancings in order to obtain favorable tax treatment 
as a result  the effect of certain transactions on these unit holders may influence our decisions affecting these properties 
departure or loss of our key officers could have an adverse effect on us 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued services of our existing executive officers 
our executive officers experience in real estate acquisition  development and finance are critical elements of our future success 
we have employment agreements for one year terms with each of our executive officers 
these agreements automatically renew for a one year term unless either we or the officer elects not to renew them 
these agreements were automatically renewed for our three executive officers through december  if one or more of our key executives were to die  become disabled or otherwise leave the company s employ  we may not be able to replace this person with an executive officer of equal skill  ability  and industry expertise 
until suitable replacements could be identified and hired  if at all  our operations and financial condition could be impaired 
we depend on external capital to fund our capital needs 
to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our net taxable income excluding net capital gains 
in order to eliminate federal income tax  we are required to distribute annually of our net taxable income  including capital gains 
partly because of these distribution requirements  we will not be able to fund all future capital needs  including capital for property development and acquisitions  with income from operations 
we therefore will have to rely on third party sources of capital  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage  expose us to the risk of default and may impose operating restrictions on us  and any additional equity we raise could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of things  including general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current debt levels  our current and potential future earnings  our cash flow and cash distributions  our ability to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and the market price of our common shares 
if we cannot obtain capital from third party sources  we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist  satisfy our principal and interest obligations or make distributions to our shareholders 
our rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our trustees and officers are limited 
maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith  in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances 
our declaration of trust and bylaws require us to indemnify our trustees and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities to the extent permitted by maryland law 
as a result  we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our trustees and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 
accordingly  in the event that actions taken in good faith by any of our trustees or officers impede the performance of our company  our shareholders ability to recover damages from such trustee or officer will be limited 
our shareholders have limited ability to prevent us from making any changes to our policies that they believe could harm our business  prospects  operating results or share price 
our board of trustees has adopted policies with respect to certain activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the discretion of our board of trustees without a vote of our shareholders 
this means that our shareholders will have limited control over changes in our policies 
such changes in our policies intended to improve  expand or diversify our business may not have the anticipated effects and consequently may adversely affect our business and prospects  results of operations and share price 
tax risks failure of our company to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to us and our shareholders 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  we intend to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit  but we cannot assure shareholders that we will qualify as a reit 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this annual report on form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our shareholders 
many of the reit requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from specific passive sources  such as rent  that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
in addition  to qualify as a reit  we cannot own specified amounts of debt and equity securities of some issuers 
we also are required to distribute to our shareholders with respect to each year at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold substantially all of our assets through our operating partnership and its subsidiaries and joint ventures further complicates the application of the reit requirements for us 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status and  given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits and the ongoing importance of factual determinations  we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to qualify as a reit 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new rulings  that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  we would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
we would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant us relief under certain statutory provisions 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  such failure would cause an event of default under our unsecured revolving credit facility and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital and to service our debt 
this likely would have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and the value of our securities 
in addition  we would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain our reit status  we would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of  or more for each such failure 
we will pay some taxes even if we qualify as a reit 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
additionally  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which dividends paid by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of of our ordinary income  of our capital gain net income and of our undistributed income from prior years 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
while we will undertake sales of assets if those assets become inconsistent with our long term strategic or return objectives  we do not believe that those sales should be considered prohibited transactions  but there can be no assurance that the irs would not contend otherwise 
the need to avoid prohibited transactions could cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that our predecessors otherwise would have sold or that it might otherwise be in our best interest to sell 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
we have elected to treat kite realty holdings  llc as a taxable reit subsidiary  and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same way they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders 
reit distribution requirements may increase our indebtedness 
we may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue income for tax purposes that has not yet been received 
in such event  or upon our repayment of principal on debt  we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 
accordingly  we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
dividends paid by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates 
the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from qualified dividends payable to us shareholders that are individuals  trusts and estates has been reduced by legislation to through 
unlike dividends received from a corporation that is not a reit  the company s distributions to individual shareholders generally are not eligible for the reduced rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends payable by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals  trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits  including our common shares

distributions by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes will be taxable to shareholders as either ordinary dividend income or capital gain income if so declared by us 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable return of capital

to the extent that distributions are both in excess of earnings and profits and in excess of the shareholder s adjusted tax basis in its common shares  the distribution will be treated as gain from the sale of common shares 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least of our reit taxable income and we must make distributions to shareholders equal to of our net taxable income to eliminate federal income tax liability 
under certain circumstances  we could be required to make distributions in excess of cash available for distributions in order to meet such requirements

in this discussion  unless the context suggests otherwise  references to the company  we  us and our mean kite realty group trust and its subsidiaries 
overview in the following overview  we discuss  among other things  the status of our business and properties  the effect that current united states economic conditions is having on our retail tenants and us  and the current state of the financial markets as pertaining to our debt maturities and our ability to secure financing 
our business and properties kite realty group trust  through its majority owned subsidiary  kite realty group  lp  is engaged in the ownership  operation  management  leasing  acquisition  redevelopment  and development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and certain commercial real estate properties in selected markets in the united states 
we derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties 
we also derive revenues from providing management  leasing  and real estate development services through our taxable reit subsidiary 
our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments  conditions in the united states retail sector and overall real estate market conditions 
as of december   we owned interests in a portfolio of operating retail properties totaling million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space and also owned interests in four operating commercial properties totaling million square feet of net rentable area and an associated parking garage 
also  as of december   we had an interest in five in process development and redevelopment properties  which  upon completion  are anticipated to have million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space 
in addition to our in process developments and redevelopments  we have future developments  which include land parcels that are undergoing pre development activity and are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financing 
as of december   these future developments consisted of three projects that are expected to contain million square feet of gross leasable area upon completion 
finally  as of december   we also owned interests in other land parcels comprising acres that may be used for future expansion of existing properties  development of new retail or commercial properties or sold to third parties 
these land parcels are classified as land held for development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
current economic conditions and impact on our retail tenants economic conditions remained uneven for the united states economy  businesses  consumers  housing and credit markets throughout a prolonged economic recovery has not yet been reached due to continued challenges in the housing market  mixed economic data  and concerns over the us federal government s ability to respond to these challenges 
despite these uncertain conditions  consumer spending improved slightly in the second half of in addition  certain retailers continue to announce plans to increase their store openings over the next months 
however  there is no certainty that these trends will continue and the following factors could contribute to a decline in consumer spending at stores owned and or operated by our retail tenants include  among others shortage or unavailability of financing economic and market conditions in the united states began to stabilize somewhat during credit conditions have continued to improve with increased access and availability to secured mortgage debt and the unsecured bond and equity markets 
lending institutions continue to maintain tighter credit standards for individual and small business lending  making it difficult for individuals and local retailers including our tenants to obtain financing 
in addition  continued depression of home values has caused individuals to utilize home equity as a source of funding for small businesses 
this shortage of financing has caused  among other things  some consumers to have less disposable income available for retail spending 
the shortage of financing has also made it difficult for some of our tenants to obtain capital to operate their businesses 
lower home values and increased home foreclosures the decline in us home values started to level out in  but difficult economic conditions have also contributed to a record number of home foreclosures 
the us continues to experience historically high levels of delinquencies and foreclosures 
continued high unemployment rates the us unemployment rate has declined in recent months to in january but continues to be higher than historical levels 
continued high unemployment rates could cause further decreases in consumer spending  thereby negatively affecting the businesses of our retail tenants 
we continue to focus on markets where household income within a five mile radius of our properties is higher than statewide levels 
as an example  the average household income within a five mile radius of our indiana properties is approximately  compared to a statewide average of approximately during  job growth and consumer spending improved somewhat from historically low levels experienced during the recent recession 
in addition  some retailers reported improving same store sale results during the holiday season 
however  it is uncertain if these improvements will continue  level off or reverse themselves 
lower consumer spending has a negative impact on the businesses of our retail tenants 
while we did experience strong leasing activity in  to the extent these conditions persist or deteriorate further  our tenants may be required to curtail or cease their operations  which could materially and negatively affect our business in general and our cash flow in particular 
impact of economy on reits  including us as an owner and developer of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our operating and financial performance is directly affected by economic conditions in the retail sector of those markets in which our operating centers and development properties are located  including the states of indiana  florida and texas  where the majority of our operating properties are located  and in north carolina  where a significant portion of our development projects are located 
as discussed above  due to the challenges facing us consumers  the operations of many of our retail tenants could be negatively affected 
this could in turn have a negative impact on our business based on  but not limited to  the following difficulty in collecting rent  rent adjustments 
when consumers spend less  our tenants typically experience decreased revenues and cash flows 
this makes it more difficult for some of our local and regional tenants to pay their rent obligations  which is the primary source of our revenues 
our tenants decreased cash flows may be even more pronounced if  given the tight credit markets  they are unable to obtain financing to operate their businesses 
the number of tenants requesting decreases or deferrals in their rent obligations declined in in comparison to and  however  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
if granted  such decreases or deferrals negatively affect our cash flows 
termination of leases 
if our tenants find it difficult to meet their rental obligations  they may be forced to terminate their leases with us 
during  tenants at some of our properties terminated their leases with us 
in some cases  we were able to secure replacement tenants at rental rates comparable to or greater than the rates of the terminated tenants 
tenant bankruptcies 
the number of bankruptcies by us businesses has decreased from the historically high levels experienced during recent years 
while we have seen a decrease over the past year in tenant bankruptcies  we have continued to experience bankruptcy levels higher than our historically normal levels  a trend which may continue into the foreseeable future 
for example  sears holdings  which leases  square feet at sunland town center in texas and accounts for of annualized base rent  has recently announced it is closing stores 
the store at our center is not among those identified by sears  however  there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
as of january   this tenant was current on its rent payments 
decrease in demand for retail space 
demand for retail space at our shopping centers and at our in process developments continued to improve in  most notably from national and regional retailers 
demand from local  small shop merchants has remained soft  reflecting the difficulty such potential tenants have securing financing for working capital and expansion plans 
while our leasing activity remained high and the overall leased percentage of our retail shopping centers increased in overall demand for retail space may not continue and may decline in the future until financial markets  consumer confidence  and the economy stabilize for an extended period of time 
financing strategy  and debt maturities our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms and to refinance borrowings as they mature is affected by the condition of the economy in general and by instability of the financial markets in particular 
subsequent to december   we have retired million of the million of debt maturing in through asset sales and borrowing under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the remaining million of our debt maturities relates to our fox lake crossing shopping center 
we are pursuing financing alternatives to enable us to repay  refinance  or extend the maturity date of this loan 
based on our favorable experience with property level debt and the improvements in the lending environment over the last couple of years  we believe we will be able to satisfactorily address the remaining debt maturity  however  we cannot provide assurances about our ability to do so 
failure to comply with our obligations under these various property level loan agreements could cause an event of default  which  among other things  could result in the loss of title to assets securing such loans  the acceleration of principal and interest payments  termination of the debt facilities  exposure to the risk of foreclosure  or charges to our earnings 
we believe we have good relationships with a number of banks and other financial institutions that will allow us to continue our strategy of refinancing our borrowings with the existing lenders or replacement lenders 
however  in this current environment  it is imperative that we identify alternative sources of financing and other capital in the event we are not able to refinance these loans on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if we are not able to refinance or extend these loans  our financial condition and liquidity could be adversely impacted 
it is also important for us to obtain additional financing in order to complete our in process development and redevelopment projects 
in  we strengthened our balance sheet by entering into an amended and restated three year million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the unsecured facility has a maturity date of june  with a one year extension option to renew under certain circumstances 
we also entered into million of additional financing and refinancing related activities in as of december   we had a combined million of available liquidity in the form of availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility million  cash and cash equivalents including our pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures million  and a revolving line of credit secured by a portion of our fishers station property million 
as of february   we had a combined million of available liquidity 
in addition to refinancing our unsecured revolving credit facility  we were also successful in extending the maturity dates or refinancing all of our property level loans originally maturing in and some of our loans originally maturing in for example in  we extended the maturity date or refinanced the debt at five of our properties indiana state motor pool  to february  fishers station  to june  bayport commons  to september  eddy street commons  to september  and eastgate pavilion  to december 
a schedule of our consolidated maturities excluding regular principal payments as of december  is set forth below year amount thereafter regular principal payments unamortized premiums total we will continue to assess and engage in negotiations with existing and alternative lenders for our near term maturing indebtedness  with a view toward extending  refinancing or repaying debt to strengthen our balance sheet 
obtaining new financing is also important to our business due to the capital needs of our existing development and redevelopment projects 
as of december   the unfunded amount of the total estimated projects costs of our in process development and redevelopment projects was approximately million 
while we believe we will have access to sufficient funding to be able to fund our investments in these projects through a combination of new and existing construction loans and uses of our available liquidity which  as noted above  was million as of december   adverse market conditions may make it more costly and difficult to raise additional capital  if necessary 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the compilation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
capitalization of certain pre development and development costs we incur costs prior to land acquisition and for certain land held for development  including acquisition contract deposits as well as legal  engineering  cost of internal resources and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center or other project 
these pre development costs are capitalized and included in construction in progress in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that the completion of a development project is no longer probable  all previously incurred pre development costs are immediately expensed 
we also capitalize costs such as construction  interest  real estate taxes  and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved with the development of our properties 
as a portion of the development property becomes operational  we expense appropriate costs on a pro rata basis 
impairment of investment properties and joint ventures management reviews both operational and development projects  land parcels and intangible assets for impairment on at least a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable 
the review for possible impairment requires management to make certain assumptions and estimates and requires significant judgment 
impairment losses for investment properties are measured when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected holding period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are recorded as the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset 
our impairment review for land and development properties assumes we have the intent and the ability to complete the developments or projected uses for the land parcels 
if we determine those plans will not be completed or our assumptions with respect to operating assets are not realized  an impairment loss may be appropriate 
management does not believe any investment properties or development assets were impaired as of december  operating properties held for sale include only those properties available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year  amongst other factors 
operating properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held for sale period 
the company had no investment properties or development assets held for sale as of december  our operating properties have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities 
the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations  and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition 
when material  current and prior period operating results are reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
we also review our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investments from future expected cash flows from the unconsolidated entity 
if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we will recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value and the determination of when a loss is other than temporary are complex and subjective 
use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 
revenue recognition as lessor  we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases 
base minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on a tenant s sales volume contingent percentage rent 
percentage rent is recognized when tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements 
percentage rent is included in other property related revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the applicable expense is incurred 
gains from sales of real estate are not recognized unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property 
as part of the company s ongoing business strategy  it will  from time to time  sell land parcels and outlots  some of which are ground leased to tenants  on a case by case basis 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
project costs include all direct labor  subcontract  and material costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance incurred to date 
project costs do not include uninstalled materials 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
development fees and fees from advisory services are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are rendered 
performance based incentive fees are recorded when the fees are earned 
fair value measurements fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement 
therefore  a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs for identical instruments that are classified within level and observable inputs for similar instruments that are classified within level and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions unobservable inputs classified within level 
as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the only assets or liabilities that we record at fair value on a recurring basis are interest rate hedge agreements 
the valuation is determined using widely accepted techniques including discounted cash flow analysis  which considers the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable market based inputs such as interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
we also incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
income taxes and reit compliance we are considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes and qualify as a reit 
as a result  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute our reit taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain other requirements on a recurring basis 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we may also be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income even if we do qualify as a reit 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains

same property net operating income the company believes that net operating income noi is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of its operating performance  such as depreciation and amortization  interest expense  and impairment  if any 
the company believes that same property noi is helpful to investors as a measure of its operating performance because it includes only the noi of properties that have been owned for the full period presented  which eliminates disparities in net income due to the redevelopment  acquisition or disposition of properties during the particular period presented  and thus provides a more consistent metric for the comparison of the company s properties 
noi and same property noi should not  however  be considered as alternatives to net income calculated in accordance with gaap as indicators of the company s financial performance

for the overall portfolio  the gross recovery ratio improved from in to in  primarily due to the improved occupancy level of the operating portfolio 
the gross recovery ratio is computed by dividing tenant reimbursements by the sum of recoverable property operating expense and real estate tax expense 
other property related revenue primarily consists of parking revenues  percentage rent  lease settlement income and gains from land sales 
this revenue decreased million  or  primarily as a result of lower gains on land sales of million due to lower volume of residential land sales at eddy street commons in and no retail outlot sales in as compared to three outlot sales in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in termination fees of million and insurance recovery income of million

redevelopment plans for these properties were finalized during the second quarter of  resulting in a reduction of useful lives of certain assets that were scheduled to be demolished 
these decreases in depreciation and amortization were partially offset by an increase of million related to acquired properties  transition of development properties to the operating portfolio  and timing of lease commencement at fully operational properties 
of this million  million was due to accelerated depreciation on the redevelopment of oleander pointe that commenced in the second quarter of interest expense decreased million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to reduction of indebtedness from the proceeds of our december preferred stock issuance

excluding the changes due to transitioned development properties  the consolidation of the centre  and properties under redevelopment  the net million increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the higher amounts of accelerateddepreciation and amortization of vacated tenant costs related to tenants that terminated at our operating properties in as compared to the prior year 
interest expense increased million  or  with million of the increase primarily due to the cessation of interest capitalization as we delayed our plans at one of our development properties in and also transitioned other properties to operating status 
the remainder of the increase was due to higher borrowing costs for new borrowings and debt refinanced since partially offset by debt repayments during the same period

liquidity and capital resources current state of capital markets and our financing strategy our primary finance and capital strategy is to strengthen our balance sheet with sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investment activities in a cost effective manner 
we consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding additional borrowings or equity offerings  including the purchase price of properties to be developed or acquired  the estimated market value of our properties and the company as a whole upon placement of the borrowing or offering  and the ability of particular properties to generate cash flow to cover debt service 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
in  we did not complete any offerings of common shares or preferred shares 
in and  we received aggregate net proceeds of million from offerings of our common shares 
in december  we received net proceeds of million from an offering of our series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares 
in addition to raising new capital  we have also been successful in refinancing or extending the maturities of our debt that were originally scheduled to mature in and in  we entered into an amended and restated three year million unsecured revolving credit facility with a one year extension option 
we also entered into million of additional financing and refinancing related activities in subsequent to december   we had retired million of the million of debt maturing in through asset sales and borrowing on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the remaining million of our debt maturities relates to our fox lake crossing shopping center 
we are pursuing financing alternatives to enable us to repay  refinance  or extend the maturity date of this loan 
we were also able to effectively recycle capital by selling outlots  unoccupied land parcels  and non core operating properties 
during  we generated gross proceeds of million from such sales  the majority of which was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
in february  we sold gateway shopping center in marysville  washington for a sales price of million and expect to record a gain on this sale in the first quarter of the net proceeds from the sale were used to retire the variable rate loan on the property of million  and the company s share of the remaining net proceeds was approximately million 
in the future  we may raise additional capital by pursuing joint venture capital partnerships and or disposing of additional properties  land parcels or other assets that are no longer core components of our growth strategy 
we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents including pro rata share of unconsolidated joint ventures cash on hand of million 
we may be subject to concentrations of credit risk with regards to our cash and cash equivalents 
we place our cash and short term cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions 
from time to time  such investments may temporarily be held in accounts in excess of fdic and sipc insurance limits  however  we attempt to limit our exposure at any one time 
we also maintain certain compensating balances in several financial institutions in support of borrowings from those institutions 
such compensating balances were not material to the consolidated balance sheets 
our principal capital resources our unsecured revolving credit facility the operating partnership is a party to an amended and restated three year million unsecured revolving credit facility the unsecured facility along with a group of financial institutions led by key bank national association  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na  as syndication agent 
the company and several of the operating partnership s subsidiaries are guarantors of the operating partnership s obligations under the unsecured facility 
the unsecured facility has a maturity date of june  and has a one year option to renew under certain circumstances 
borrowings under the unsecured facility bear interest at a floating interest rate of libor to basis points  depending on the company s leverage 
the unsecured facility has a commitment fee of to basis points on unused borrowings 
subject to certain conditions  including the prior consent of the lenders  the company has the option to increase its borrowings under the unsecured facility to a maximum of million if there are sufficient unencumbered assets to support the additional borrowings 
the unsecured facility also includes a short term borrowing line of million with a variable interest rate 
borrowings under the short term line may not be outstanding for more than five days 
the amount that the company may borrow under the unsecured facility is based on the value of assets in its unencumbered property pool 
as of december   the company had unencumbered properties and other assets used to calculate the value of the unencumbered property pool  of which were wholly owned and three of which were owned through joint ventures 
the major unencumbered assets include broadstone station  the centre  coral springs plaza  courthouse shadows  four corner square  king s lake square  lithia crossing  market street village  oleander pointe  pen products  red bank commons  shops at eagle creek  traders point ii  union station parking garage  wal mart plaza  and waterford lakes village 
as of december   the total amount available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility was million 
as of december   our outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured facility was million  bearing interest at a rate of libor basis points 
we anticipate that the interest rate will range from libor basis points to libor basis points in in addition  we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of december  the company s ability to borrow under the unsecured facility is subject to ongoing compliance with various restrictive covenants  including with respect to liens  indebtedness  investments  dividends  mergers and asset sales 
in addition  the unsecured facility requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants  including but not all a maximum leverage ratio of  reducing to on december  after this date  the leverage ratio can be above for a maximum of two consecutive quarters  adjusted ebitda as defined in the unsecured facility to fixed charges coverage ratio excluding preferred dividends of at least to  minimum tangible net worth defined as total asset value less total indebtedness of million plus of the net proceeds of any future equity issuances from the date of the agreement  the aggregate amount of unsecured debt of the company  operating partnership and their respective subsidiaries not exceeding the lesser of a of the value of all properties then included in an unencumbered pool of properties that satisfy certain requirements and b the maximum principal amount of debt which would not cause the ratio of certain net operating income less capital reserves to debt service under the unsecured facility to be less than to  ratio of secured indebtedness to total asset value of no more than 
to  minimum unencumbered property pool occupancy rate of  ratio of floating rate debt to total asset value of no more than to  and ratio of recourse debt to total asset value of no more than to the company was in compliance with all applicable covenants under the unsecured facility as of december  under the terms of the unsecured facility  the company is permitted to make distributions to its shareholders of up to of its funds from operations provided that no event of default exists 
if an event of default exists  the company may only make distributions sufficient to maintain its reit status 
however  the company may not make any distributions if an event of default resulting from nonpayment or bankruptcy exists  or if its obligations under the credit facility are accelerated 
capital markets we have filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to offer  from time to time  common shares or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
in may  we issued  common shares for net proceeds of million 
in december  the company completed an equity offering of  shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross and net proceeds of million and million  respectively 
a portion of the net proceeds were used to retire our million unsecured term loan  which had a maturity date of july the remaining net proceeds and borrowings on the line of credit were used to retire the million loan and temporarily unencumber international speedway square 
our series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares have no stated maturity date although they may be redeemed  at our option  beginning in december we will continue to monitor the capital markets and may consider raising additional capital through the issuance of our common shares  preferred shares or other securities 
sale of real estate assets we may pursue opportunities to sell non strategic real estate assets in order to generate additional liquidity 
our ability to dispose of such properties is dependent on the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable 
sales prices on such transactions may be less than our carrying value 
in  we were also able to effectively recycle capital by selling outlots  unoccupied land parcels  and non core operating properties 
during  we generated gross proceeds of million from such sales  the majority of which was used to pay down outstanding indebtedness 
in february  we sold gateway shopping center in marysville  washington for a sales price of million and expect to record a gain on this sale in the first quarter of the net proceeds from the sale were used to retire the variable rate loan on the property of million  and the company s share of the remaining net proceeds was approximately million 
short and long term liquidity needs overview we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  the recent economic downturn adversely affected the ability of some of our tenants to meet their lease obligations  as discussed in more detail above in overview on page these conditions  in turn  had a negative impact on our business 
short term liquidity needs the nature of our business  coupled with the requirements to qualify for reit status and in order to receive a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends paid to shareholders  necessitate that we distribute at least of our taxable income on an annual basis  which will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt  expected dividend payments including distributions to persons who hold units in our operating partnership and recurring capital expenditures 
our board of trustees the board declared quarterly cash distribution of per common share for each quarter of and each quarter we discuss with our board our liquidity requirements along with other relevant factors before the board decides whether and in what amount to declare a cash distribution 
when we lease space to new tenants  or renew leases for existing tenants  we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
this amount  as well as the amount of recurring capital expenditures that we incur  will vary from year to year 
during the year ended december   we incurred million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on operating properties and also incurred million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions excluding first generation space and development and redevelopment properties 
we currently anticipate incurring approximately million in recurring capital expenditures at our operating properties and approximately million of additional major tenant improvements and renovation costs within the next twelve months at several operating properties 
we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in these projects through borrowings on our unsecured credit facility and construction loans 
in certain circumstances  we may seek to place specific construction financing on these redevelopment projects 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through borrowings under the unsecured facility  new construction loans  cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  accessing the public equity and debt markets to the extent that we are able to do so 
debt maturities as of december   million of our outstanding indebtedness was scheduled to mature in  excluding scheduled monthly principal payments 
subsequent to december   we had retired million of these maturities through asset sales and borrowing on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
the remaining million of our debt maturities relates to our fox lake crossing shopping center 
we are pursuing financing alternatives to enable us to repay  refinance  or extend the maturity date of this loan 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties  non recurring capital expenditures  acquisitions of properties  and payment of indebtedness at maturity 
in process development and redevelopment properties 
as of december   we had five in process development or redevelopment projects 
the total estimated cost  including our share and our joint venture partners share  for these projects is approximately million  of which million had been incurred as of december  we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund these projects and expect to do so primarily through construction loans 
future redevelopment properties 
as of december   three of our properties bolton plaza  the centre  and courthouse shadows were undergoing redevelopment 
we currently anticipate our total investment in these redevelopment projects will be approximately million  of which million has been incurred as of december   however  this amount may increase as redevelopment plans are finalized 
we believe we currently have sufficient financing in place to fund our investment in the remaining projects through borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in certain circumstances  we may seek to place specific construction financing on these redevelopment projects 
future development pipeline 
in addition to our in process developments  we have a future development pipeline which includes land parcels that are in various stages of preparation for construction to commence  including pre leasing activity and negotiations for third party financing 
as of december   this future development pipeline consisted of three projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of total leasable area 
we currently anticipate the total estimated cost of these projects will be approximately million  of which our share is currently expected to be approximately million 
although we intend to develop these properties  we are not contractually obligated to complete any of these future developments 
with respect to each future development project  our policy is to not commence vertical construction until pre established leasing thresholds are achieved and the requisite third party financing is in place 
we intend to fund our investment in these developments primarily through new construction loans and joint ventures  as well as borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility  if necessary 
selective acquisitions  developments and joint ventures 
we may selectively pursue the acquisition and development of other properties  which would require additional capital 
it is unlikely we would have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long term capital requirements 
we would have to satisfy these needs through participation in joint venture arrangements  additional borrowings  sales of common or preferred shares and or cash generated through property dispositions 
we cannot be certain that we would have access to these sources of capital on satisfactory terms  if at all  to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
we evaluate all future opportunities against pre established criteria including  but not limited to  location  demographics  tenant relationships  and amount of existing retail space 
our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors  including general capital market conditions  which is discussed in more detail above in overview on page cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to improved operating results partially offset by higher cash out flows for deferred leasing costs and escrow deposits in in addition  we received distributions from unconsolidated entities of million in as a result of the sale of the eddy street limited service hotel asset 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  an increase of million from the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of an increase in capital expenditures  net from million in to million in along with cash out flows for the acquisitions of oleander pointe and lithia crossing of million 
in addition  the company contributed million to our parkside town commons development property in  while  in  we contributed  to our eddy street commons limited service hotel property 
these increases were offset by net proceeds from the sale of our martinsville shops operating property of million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  an increase of million from in  we had a net increase in debt of million that was utilized to fund current year development and acquisition activity 
this increase was offset by current year distributions to common shareholders  preferred shareholders  and entities that hold noncontrolling interests 
in addition  we paid million to acquire our partners interests in the centre 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase was primarily due to higher cash outflows for accounts payable and accrued expenses in  the majority of which reflects third party construction activity completed in the first half of cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of a decline of million in contributions to joint ventures 
in  we contributed million to our parkside town commons development property and the centre operating property  while  in  we contributed  to our eddy street commons limited service hotel property 
additionally  in  we advanced million to our joint venture partner in the centre  and in  million of this note was repaid 
the remainder is a decrease of million in cash outflows for capital expenditures as part of our cash conservation strategy  we significantly reduced our acquisition  development and construction activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  a decrease of million from in  we had a net reduction in debt of million due to ongoing efforts to continue to strengthen our balance sheet 
the following items highlight additional significant capital transactions in december  we issued million shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred shares for net proceeds of million 
a portion of the net proceeds were utilized to retire our million unsecured term loan 
in order to retain additional cash to meet our capital needs  we reduced our quarterly dividend beginning in the second quarter of we paid cash dividends of per share in  compared to cash dividends of per share in off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do  however  have certain obligations to some of the projects in our in process development pipeline  as discussed below in contractual obligations  as well as our joint venture with prudential real estate investors with respect to our parkside town commons development  as discussed above 
as of december   we owned a interest in this joint venture which  under the terms of this joint venture  will be reduced to upon the placement of construction financing 
as of december   our share of unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness was million 
unconsolidated joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the assets of the joint venture 
the operating partnership had guaranteed its million share of the unconsolidated joint venture debt related to the parkside town commons development in the event the joint venture partnership defaults under the terms of the underlying arrangement 
mortgages which are guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture and the joint venture could sell the property in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information on our unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december   and as of december   we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million and no amounts were advanced against these instruments 
with respect to our eddy street commons development  we have jointly guaranteed the apartment developer s construction loan  which had an outstanding balance of million as of december  the apartments are complete with stabilized occupancy and the owner intends to secure nonrecourse financing in at which time our guarantee obligation will be eliminated 
we have not been required and do not expect to be required to satisfy any portion of this guarantee 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties based on contracts executed as of december  development and construction contracts tenant allowances operating leases consolidated long term debt and interest pro rata share of joint venture debt and interest employment contracts total thereafter total tenant allowances include commitments made to tenants at our operating and in process development and redevelopment properties 
our long term debt consists of both variable and fixed rate debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rates as of december  we have entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management 
under these agreements  each individual received a stipulated annual base salary through december  each agreement has an automatic one year renewal unless we or the individual elects not to renew the agreement 
the contracts have been extended through december  in connection with the construction of the eddy street commons parking garage and certain infrastructure improvements  we are obligated to fund payments under tax increment financing tif bonds issued by the city of south bend  indiana 
the majority of the bonds will be funded by real estate tax payments made by us and subject to reimbursement from the tenants of the property 
if there are delays in the development  we are obligated to pay certain delay fees 
however  we have an agreement with the city of south bend to limit our exposure to a maximum of million as to such fees 
in addition  we will not be in default concerning other obligations under the agreement with the city of south bend so long as we commence and diligently pursue the completion of our obligations under that agreement 
in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   then we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to their built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment

this revolver has a maturity date of june  at an interest rate of libor there are no amounts outstanding under this line of credit as of december  funds from operations funds from operations ffo  is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which we refer to as the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as consolidated net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales and impairments of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for third party shares of appropriate items 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in consolidated net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
we believe that our presentation of adjusted ffo provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and compared to our peers 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computations of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits 
our calculation of ffo 
and reconciliation to consolidated net income loss 
is as follows funds from operations year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  consolidated net income loss less preferred stock dividend add loss deduct gain on sale of operating property add non cash loss on impairment of real estate asset less non cash gain from consolidation of subsidiary  net of noncontrolling interests less gain on sale of unconsolidated property  including tax benefit less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in properties add depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities  net of noncontrolling interests funds from operations of the kite portfolio less redeemable noncontrolling interests in funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company funds from operations of the kite portfolio measures of the operating performance of the operating partnership s real estate properties and construction and service subsidiaries in which the company owns an interest

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates of debt instruments of similar maturities and terms 
market risk related to fixed and variable rate debt we had million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of december  inclusive of net premiums on acquired debt of million 
as of december   we were party to various consolidated interest rate hedge agreements for a total of million  with maturities over various terms ranging from through including the effects of these hedge agreements  our fixed and variable rate debt would have been million and million  respectively  of our total consolidated indebtedness at december  including our million share of unconsolidated variable rate debt and the effect of related hedge agreements  our fixed and variable rate debt is and  respectively  of the total of consolidated and our share of unconsolidated indebtedness at december  our future earnings  cash flows and fair values related to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  primarily libor 
libor was at historically low levels during based on the amount of our fixed rate debt at december   a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would decrease our annual cash flow by approximately million 
based upon the terms of our variable rate debt  we are most vulnerable to change in short term libor interest rates 
the sensitivity analysis was estimated using cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates adjusted by basis points 
as a matter of policy  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative transactions 
inflation most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance to the extent we are able to recover such costs from our tenants 
however  increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage and debt interest and general and administrative expenses  as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents 
also  inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases or limits on such tenant s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses  which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time  and limit our ability to recover all of our operating expenses
