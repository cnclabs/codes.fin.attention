significant business developments 
net sales declined in  totaling million  compared to million in  as growth in our extremity product line was offset by declines in our other product lines 
our domestic sales were down  as a increase in extremities sales was offset by a decline in biologics sales  a decline in hip sales  and a decline in knee sales 
our us sales were negatively affected by distributor transitions and challenges associated with implementing enhancements to our compliance processes 
as anticipated  these challenges have resulted in a slowdown in medical education and research and development projects 
additionally  our us hip and knee sales in particular  continue to be affected by the overall market conditions experienced throughout the industry  including declining procedure 
table of contents volumes and pricing 
our international sales increased by during as compared to driven by favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
in  we had a net loss of million  compared to million of net income in this decrease is primarily driven by million million net of taxes of charges related to restructuring and million million net of taxes related to management s estimate of our liability for previous and estimated future fractures of our profemur titanium long modular necks in north america  as well as higher levels of costs associated with our deferred prosecution agreement and the impact of our year over year sales decline 
in january  we announced the extension of our supply agreement with lifecell corporation  a business unit of kinetic concepts  inc kci for the supply of graftjacket regenerative tissue matrix through december for orthopaedic markets 
in addition  we entered into an agreement with kci to license our graftjacket brand to kci for exclusive use in wound markets for million plus payments based on future sales of the licensed products 
in february  we announced that we had commenced a tender offer for any and all of our outstanding convertible senior notes 
upon expiration of the tender offer  we used the proceeds from a million borrowing under a term loan facility available under our senior credit facility and cash on hand to fund the purchase of all million of the notes validly tendered in the tender offer and not withdrawn prior to the expiration date 
following the closing of the tender offer  million aggregate principal amount of the notes remain outstanding

we currently estimate the total cost associated with this plan to range from approximately million to million 
during  we recognized million of restructuring charges in total  primarily for severance obligations  contract termination costs  and non cash asset impairment charges  as well as excess and obsolete inventory provisions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring charges 
in september  we announced that we reached an agreement with the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao under which we voluntarily agreed to extend the term of the dpa for months 
we also agreed with the oig hhs to an amendment to the cia under which certain of wmt s substantive obligations under the cia will now begin on september   when the amended dpa monitoring period expires 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our dpa and cia amendments 
in october  we acquired the patented cci evolution mobile bearing total ankle replacement system of van straten medical bv for approximately million 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 
opportunities and challenges 
we believe that we have an opportunity to transform our business to increase our foot and ankle revenue growth rates and increase our cash generation through significant reduction of our inventories 
in order to increase our foot and ankle growth rates  we plan to make changes in to attempt to realize these opportunities  including aggressively converting a portion of our us independent distributor foot and ankle territories to direct sales representation  substantially increasing our investment in foot and ankle medical education to drive market adoption of new products and technologies  and implementing steps to significantly reduce inventories over the next several years 
these transformational changes for our business will require significant investment in  which will negatively impact our 
table of contents sales results of operations in however  we believe these investments will improve the performance of our business in the longer term 
we believe that our us businesses will continue to be unfavorably affected by distributor transitions and challenges associated with implementing enhancements to our compliance processes 
further  we expect that our us and international businesses will continue to be unfavorably affected by the market conditions being experienced throughout the hip and knee industry  including procedural growth rates below historical levels and pricing declines 
beginning in  we will be subject to a excise tax on us sales of medical devices  as prescribed in the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act collectively known as the affordable care act 
the specific regulations on this tax are still in draft form 
we believe that the impact of this tax may have a negative impact on our profitability 
significant industry factors 
our industry is affected by numerous competitive  regulatory  and other significant factors 
the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearance and compliance for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  respond to competitive pressures specific to each of our geographic markets  including our ability to enforce non compete agreements  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
we  and the entire industry  are subject to extensive governmental regulation  primarily by the united states food and drug administration fda 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and continues to experience pricing pressures  specifically in the areas of reconstructive joint devices 
in december  we received a subpoena from the united states department of justice doj through the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao requesting documents for the period january through the present related to any consulting and professional service agreements with orthopaedic surgeons in connection with hip or knee joint replacement procedures or products 
this subpoena was served shortly after several of our knee and hip competitors agreed with the doj to resolutions of similar investigations 
on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  wright medical technology  inc wmt  entered into a month deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the usao and a civil settlement agreement csa with the united states 
under the dpa  the usao filed a criminal complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey charging wmt with conspiracy to commit violations of the anti kickback statute usc a b during the years through the court deferred prosecution of the criminal complaint during the term of the dpa and the usao agreed that if wmt complied with the dpa s provisions  the usao would seek dismissal of the criminal complaint 
pursuant to the csa  wmt settled civil and administrative claims relating to the matter for a payment of million without any admission by wmt 
in conjunction with the csa  wmt also entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the united states department of health and human services oig hhs 
pursuant to the dpa  an independent monitor is reviewing and evaluating wmt s compliance with its obligations under the dpa 
the dpa and the cia were filed as exhibits and  respectively  to our current report on form k filed on september  the dpa has also been posted to our website 
each of the dpa and the cia could be modified by mutual consent of the parties thereto 
as a result of the work of the independent monitor and wmt s compliance program  the board of directors became aware of facts indicative of possible compliance issues 
at the direction of the nominating  compliance and governance committee of the board of directors of wmt s parent  wright medical group  inc wmgi  wmgi and wmt conducted an internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel 
the board of directors of wmgi received a report from outside counsel 
on may   our wholly owned subsidiary wright medical technology  inc wmt provided written notice to the independent monitor and to the united states attorney s office for the district of new jersey usao of credible evidence of serious wrongdoing  pursuant to a notification requirement in paragraph of the deferred prosecution agreement dpa 
on may   wmt received a letter from the usao pursuant to paragraph of the dpa stating that the usao believed that wmt had knowingly and willfully breached material provisions of the dpa 
the issues wmt is addressing relate to i usc a b b also known as the anti kickback statute  specifically regarding certain employees communications with a health care professional for consulting opportunities in a manner not consistent with wmt s compliance policy  ii the violation of paragraph of the dpa due to the communications with a healthcare professional noted above  and iii alleged violations of paragraph of the dpa due to failure to provide information to the monitor in a timely manner 
in order to resolve these issues  wmt has implemented a number of remedial measures  including i taking appropriate personnel actions  ii enhancing its policies and employee training with respect to compliance with the requirements of paragraph of the dpa  which requires all company employees and agents to report suspected legal and policy violations  and paragraph of the dpa  which governs interactions with consultants on the terms of consulting agreements and payment issues  iii reviewing its existing relationships with certain customers and taking appropriate further action where necessary with respect to these 
table of contents relationships  and iv clarifying lines of responsibility for making payments to consultants 
wmt continues to provide ongoing employee training and to review its relationships with customers  and is developing a protocol for internal reporting and investigation of allegations of misconduct relating to senior management 
on september   wmt reached an agreement with the usao and the oig hhs under which wmt voluntarily agreed to extend the term of its dpa for months 
as amended  the dpa will now expire on september  the usao has agreed not to take any additional action regarding any breach of the dpa referenced in the aforementioned may  letter from the usao unless it finds  prior to september   that wmt has committed a knowing  willful and uncured breach of a material provision of the dpa by its conduct after september  or by conduct before september  of which the independent monitor was not aware on that date 
if wmt complies with all of the requirements of the amended dpa  the usao will seek dismissal of the pending criminal complaint 
wmt also agreed with the oig hhs to an amendment to the corporate integrity agreement cia under which certain of wmt s substantive obligations under the cia will now begin on september   when the amended dpa monitoring period expires 
the term of the cia has not changed  and will expire as previously provided on september  in connection with such amendment  the oig hhs informed wmt that it had no present intention  based on the information then known to it  to exercise its authority under paragraph of the dpa to exclude wright from participation in federal healthcare programs based on any breach referenced in the may letter unless the usao were to take further action related to an alleged breach of the dpa by wmt 
as previously disclosed  at the direction of the company s board of directors  wmt has continued to implement compliance measures and to take steps to enhance wmt s compliance environment 
from time to time  wmt has provided  and may in the future provide  pursuant to paragraph of the dpa  written notices to the independent monitor and the usao of credible evidence of violations of usc  a strict liability provision of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and any such notices have been and will be provided to the oig hhs 
paragraph of the dpa requires wmt to provide written notice to the independent monitor and the usao of credible evidence of violations of any criminal statute  regardless of whether any such violations are material 
wmt has conducted a review of its clinical and regulatory affairs operations  and may conduct further reviews on an ongoing periodic basis 
although circumstances may change  the company intends to disclose in its future filings with the securities and exchange commission any additional occasions when wmt provides written notice under paragraph of the dpa or under the cia only if such potential violation or violations  or any consequences therefrom  are required to be reported under us federal securities laws 
under the dpa  the company and the independent monitor perform their investigative activities  and communications amongst wmt and the independent monitor  and other governmental agencies are ongoing 
we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these activities 
the dpa and cia impose certain obligations on wmt to maintain compliance with us healthcare laws  regulations and other requirements 
our failure to do so could expose us to significant liability including  but not limited to  exclusion from federal healthcare program participation  including medicaid and medicare  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  potential prosecution  including under the previously filed criminal complaint  civil and criminal fines or penalties  and additional litigation cost and expense 
a breach of the dpa or the cia could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility  which in turn could result in an event of default under the indenture 
in addition to the usao and oig hhs  other governmental agencies  including state authorities  could conduct investigations or institute proceedings that are not precluded by the terms of the settlements reflected in the dpa and the cia 
in addition  the settlement with the usao and oig hhs could increase our exposure to lawsuits by potential whistleblowers  including under the federal false claims acts  based on new theories or allegations arising from the allegations made by the usao 
the costs of defending or resolving any such investigations or proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the successful implementation of our enhanced compliance program requires the full and sustained cooperation of our employees  distributors  and sales agents as well as the healthcare professionals with whom they interact 
these efforts may require increased expenses and additional investments 
we may also encounter inefficiencies in the implementation of our new compliance enhancements  including delays in medical education  research and development projects  and clinical studies  which may unfavorably impact our business and our relationships with customers 
in addition  the month extension of the dpa and the associated monitorship will result in continued expenses associated with the monitor and may result in a further diversion of management time and attention from business issues which could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors is provided in risk factors

the favorable currency impact and a increase in sales in japan were partially offset by a decrease in sales in europe 
our hip product net sales totaled million in  representing a decrease over this decrease is attributable to a decline in us hip sales  driven by an decline in unit sales 
the remaining decrease was driven by a decline in average selling prices 
international hip sales increased by  attributable to a million favorable currency impact compared to net sales of our knee products totaled million in  representing a decrease of over in the us  knee sales decreased over due primarily to decreased average selling prices 
internationally  knee sales decreased in over  primarily due to lower unit sales  which was partially offset by a favorable currency impact of million 
our extremity product net sales increased to million in  representing growth of over this increase was primarily driven by our us extremity business  which increased  due primarily to our pro toe vo hammertoe fixation system  launched in the first quarter of  as well as the continued success of our inbone products and our valor ankle fusion nail system  launched in the nd quarter of international extremity sales growth of was primarily due to the continued success of our darco plating system as well as a favorable currency impact of million 
net sales of our biologic products totaled million in  which declined by  as compared to our us biologics sales decreased compared to  primarily due to the license agreement entered into with kci during the first quarter of cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased slightly in compared to from to as increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory were mostly offset by favorable manufacturing expenses and favorable currency exchange rates 
our cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses  levels of production volume and currency exchange rates 
during  cost of sales may increase due to expenses associated with lower levels of production volume and higher levels of excess and obsolete inventory provisions as we implement our strategy for significantly reducing inventories 
cost of sales restructuring 
in  we recorded charges of million of net sales for excess and obsolete inventory provisions associated with product optimization as we reduce the size of our international product portfolio 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales totaled 
table of contents and in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense for included million of non cash  stock based compensation expense of net sales  million of costs associated with our us government inquiries and our dpa of net sales  and a provision of million recognized during the quarter ended september   for management s estimate of our total liability for claims associated with previous and estimated future fractures of our titanium profemur long modular necks in north america of net sales 
during  selling  general and administrative expense included million of non cash  stock based compensation expense of net sales and million of costs associated with our us government inquiries and our dpa of net sales 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to the provision recorded for product liability discussed above  as well as increased spending on our global compliance efforts and legal fees  which were partially offset by decreased spending on medical education 
the successful implementation of our enhanced compliance program requires the full and sustained cooperation of our employees  distributors  and sales agents as well as the healthcare professionals with whom they interact 
these efforts may require increased expenses 
in addition  the month extension of the dpa and the associated monitorship has resulted in continued expenses associated with the monitor 
further  as part of our enhanced compliance program  we are in the process of evaluating our royalty agreements with our physician consultants 
if we determine that any of these royalty agreements require termination or amendment  the settlement of such termination or amendment may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
research and development 
our investment in research and development activities represented and of net sales in and  respectively 
our research and development expense included non cash  stock based compensation expense of million of net sales in  compared to million of net sales in the remaining decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to decreased spending on research and development activities and clinical studies as we encountered certain inefficiencies associated with the implementation of our enhanced compliance program 
amortization of intangible assets 
charges associated with amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  as compared to million in based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize million in  million in  million in  million in and million in restructuring charges

we believe that the remaining restructuring charges of approximately million to million will likely be recorded in the first half of interest expense  net 
interest expense  net  consists of interest expense of million and million in and  respectively  primarily from borrowings under the term loan for under our senior credit facility  and our notes for  offset by interest income of million and million during and  respectively  generated by our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities 
the amounts of interest income we realize in and beyond are subject to variability  dependent upon both the rate of invested returns we realize and the amount of excess cash balances on hand 
additionally  the amount of interest expense we incur is subject to variability dependent upon the change in london interbank offered rate libor rates and our consolidated leverage ratio 
other expense  net 
other expense  net includes approximately million of expenses in for the write off of pro rata unamortized deferred financing fees and for bank and legal fees associated with the purchase of million aggregate principal amount of the notes validly tendered in the tender offer 
benefit provision for income taxes 
we recorded tax benefit of million in and tax provision of million in our effective tax rate for and was and respectively 
the unfavorable trend in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to a million provision associated with the initial assessments from the examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service 
effective january   the research and development credit expired 
if this credit is not reinstated  our income tax provision could be unfavorably impacted by less than million

net sales 
our us net sales totaled million in and million in  representing approximately of total net sales in  of total net sales in and a increase in over our international net sales totaled million in  an increase as compared to net sales of million in our international net sales included a favorable foreign currency impact of approximately million when compared to net sales  due to the favorable performance of the japanese yen and the canadian dollar against the us dollar  which was partially offset by the unfavorable performance of the euro against the us dollar 
from a product line perspective  our net sales growth for was attributable to increases in our extremity  hip and knee product lines of  and  respectively  while our biologics product line remained flat 
during  our extremity sales growth was primarily driven by our us business  which increased  primarily due to the continued success of our inbone total ankle system  our increased sales of our ortholoc polyaxial trauma plating system  and increased sales of valor ankle fusion nail system 
the increase in our hip product sales was driven by increased sales of our profemur hip system 
sales of our knee products increased in compared to the prior year as a result of increased unit sales  which were partially offset by declines in pricing 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was in both and unfavorable geographic mix shifts  as our more profitable us sales decreased as a percentage of total sales  along with unfavorable pricing in our us hip and knee business were offset by lower levels of excess and obsolete inventory provisions and favorable manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses

the decline in interest income was due to the overall decline in interest rates on our invested cash balances and investments in marketable securities during other expense  net 
other expense  net  totaled million of expense during compared to million of expense during during  we recognized million of expense related to the write off of the cta balances for certain subsidiaries that had been substantially liquidated as part of our restructuring of operations in toulon  france 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in our valuation allowance in both years  higher levels of non deductible expenses in  primarily due to a portion of the civil settlement payment that is considered not deductible  and the greater impact of certain deductions on our lower income in 
table of contents seasonal nature of business we traditionally experience lower sales volumes in the third quarter than throughout the rest of the year as many of our reconstructive products are used in elective procedures  which generally decline during the summer months  typically resulting in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as a percentage of sales that are higher during this period than throughout the rest of the year 
in addition  our first quarter selling  general and administrative expenses include additional expenses that we incur in connection with the annual meeting held by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons aaos and the american college of foot and ankle surgeons acfas 
the aaos meeting  which is the largest orthopaedic meeting in the world  features the presentation of scientific papers and instructional courses for orthopaedic surgeons 
during this three day event  we display our most recent and innovative products for these surgeons 
the acfas meeting  similar to aaos  is another three day event to display our latest innovations in the foot and ankle market 
restructuring on september   we announced plans to implement a cost restructuring plan to foster growth  enhance profitability and cash flow  and build stockholder value 
we have implemented numerous initiatives to reduce spending  including streamlining select aspects of our international selling and distribution operations  reducing the size of our product portfolio  adjusting plant operations to align with our volume and mix expectations and rationalizing our research and development projects 
in total  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or 
we have estimated that total pre tax restructuring charges will be approximately million to million  of which we recognized million in we expect the remaining charges to be recorded during the first half of we anticipate that recording the remaining million to million of restructuring expenses could have a material impact on our results of operations in the period incurred  however  we do not expect that the restructuring expenses will have an impact on our financial condition or liquidity 
we have realized the benefits from this restructuring within selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of and expect to achieve additional savings beginning in  partially offset by unfavorable income tax consequences  and incremental expenses associated with senior management changes 
in total  our net income will have an approximately million favorable impact beginning in on an annual basis 
additionally  beginning in  we expect to realize additional benefits within cost of sales  the net income impact of which is approximately million annually 
however  the favorable impact from our cost improvement restructuring plan in will be more than offset by the additional investments we are making in for the transformational changes discussed above in opportunities and challenges 
see note to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring charges 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain liquidity measures in thousands as of december  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities working capital line of credit availability in  we began investing in long term marketable securities with maturity dates ranging from to months  consisting of investments in government  agency  and corporate bonds 
as of december   the weighted average maturity for these investments was months 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million  and million in  and respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to was due to decreased profitability  primarily associated with cash paid for restructuring charges of approximately million 
in compared to  the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in our provision for deferred taxes  which was mostly offset by changes in working capital  primarily due to the decrease in our inventory balance in investing activities 
our capital expenditures totaled million in  million in  and million in the increase in compared to is attributable to increased spending on manufacturing equipment and surgical instrumentation primarily associated with our recent launch of our evolution medial pivot knee system  as well as increased spending related to the expansion of our facilities in arlington  tennessee 
capital expenditures remained relatively flat in as decreases in spending on the previously discussed spending on manufacturing equipment and facilities expansion was offset by capital 
table of contents expenditures associated with the upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system 
historically  our capital expenditures have consisted principally of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures in of approximately million for routine capital expenditures 
financing activities 
during  cash used in financing activities totaled million  compared to cash used in financing activities in of million and cash provided by financing of million in the change is primarily attributable to the payments to fund the purchase of million of the notes validly tendered in the tender offer  mostly offset by the cash proceeds from a million borrowing under the term loan 
in  we will make continued payments under our long term capital leases  including interest  of million 
in november  we issued million of convertible senior notes due notes 
the notes will mature on december  the notes pay interest semiannually at an annual rate of and are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the holder of the notes may convert at any time on or prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of notes 
beginning on december   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded of the conversion price for at least days during any consecutive day trading period 
additionally  if we experience a fundamental change event  as defined in the indenture governing the notes indenture  the holders may require us to purchase for cash all or a portion of the notes  for of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if upon a fundamental change event  a holder elects to convert its notes  we may  under certain circumstances  increase the conversion rate for the notes surrendered 
the notes are unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinated to i all of our existing and future secured debt  including our obligations under our credit agreement  to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt  and ii because the notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries  to all liabilities of our subsidiaries 
on february   we announced the commencement of a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of our outstanding notes 
upon expiration on march   we purchased million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
as a result of this transaction  we recognized approximately million for the write off of pro rata unamortized deferred financing fees and for bank and legal fees associated with the purchase 
as of december   million aggregate principal amount of the notes remain outstanding 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility has revolver availability of million and availability in a delayed draw term loan of up to million 
the total availability can be increased by up to an additional million at our request and subject to the agreement of the lenders 
borrowings under the senior credit facility will bear interest at the sum of a base rate or a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  depending on the type of loan and our consolidated leverage ratio 
the term of the senior credit facility extends through february  as a result of this transaction  we incurred deferred financing charges of approximately million  which will be amortized over the term of the senior credit facility 
in march  to fund the purchase of the notes  we borrowed million under the delayed draw term loan term loan facility available under our senior credit facility 
the term loan bears interest at a one month london interbank offered rate libor rate  plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the senior credit facility 
as of december   the one month libor was and the applicable margin was 
quarterly repayments of the original principal amount of the term loan are required under the senior credit facility  with the remaining principal amount due on february  in march  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which we designated as cash flow hedge of the underlying variable rate obligation on our term loan 
we did not have any interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  see note for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreement 
the payment of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility is secured by pledges of of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and of the capital stock of our material foreign subsidiaries  and is guaranteed by our material domestic subsidiaries 
the senior credit facility contains customary financial and non financial covenants 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  the lenders may declare that all principal  interest and other amounts owed are immediately due and payable and may exercise any other available right or remedy 
the events of default include  but are not limited to  non payment of amounts owed  failure to perform covenants  breach of representations and warranties  institution of insolvency proceedings  entry of certain judgments  and occurrence of a change in control 
currently  the calculation of our leverage ratio in our senior credit facility agreement does not add back cash restructuring charges and expenses associated with our dpa since its extension 
in order to ensure compliance with our leverage ratio  it is possible that we may make an additional cash payment of million to million to reduce our debt during because the restructuring 
table of contents charges and dpa expenses will not have an ongoing impact on our ebitda calculation and debt covenant ratios  it is also possible that our senior credit facility will be amended to allow these charges as addbacks and therefore  we would not need to make the additional principal payment described above 
however  there can be no assurance the lender will grant these additional modifications to the current debt agreement 
as of december   we had an immaterial amount of cash and cash equivalents held in jurisdictions outside of the us  which are expected to be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in foreign operations 
repatriation of these assets to the us would have negative tax consequences 
the company does not intent to repatriate funds 
contractual cash obligations 
at december   we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by periods total after amounts reflected in consolidated balance sheet lease obligations convertible senior notes term loan amounts not reflected in consolidated balance sheet operating leases interest on convertible senior notes interest on term loan royalty and consulting agreements total contractual cash obligations payments include amounts representing interest 
represents long term debt payment provided holders of the convertible senior notes due do not exercise the option to convert each  note into shares of our common stock 
our convertible senior notes are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
represents payments on the delayed draw term loan term loan  which was used to fund the purchase of the convertible senior notes 
quarterly repayments of the original principal amount of the term loan are required under the senior credit facility  with the remaining principal amount due on february  represents interest on convertible senior notes due payable semiannually with an annual interest rate of 
represents interest on the term loan  which bears interest at a one month london interbank offered rate libor rate  plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the senior credit facility 
as of december   the one month libor was and the applicable margin was 
this estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the variable nature of the interest rates 
should interest rates vary significantly  our estimate could be materially different from actual results 
the amounts reflected in the table above for capital lease obligations represent future minimum lease payments under our capital lease agreements  which are primarily for certain property and equipment 
the present value of the minimum lease payments are recorded in our balance sheet at december  the minimum lease payments related to these leases are discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
the amounts reflected in the table above for operating leases represent future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases primarily for certain equipment and office space 
the royalty and consulting agreements in the above table represent minimum payments under non cancelable contracts with consultants that are contingent upon future services 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our purchase obligations and royalty and consulting agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
portions of these payments are denominated in foreign currencies and were translated in the table above based on their respective us dollar exchange rates at december  these future payments are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  our operating leases are not recognized in our consolidated balance 
table of contents sheet  however  the minimum lease payments related to these agreements are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
contingent consideration of up to  may be paid related to the acquisition of certain assets associated with the ez concept surgical device corporation ez frame 
the potential additional cash payments are based on the future financial performance of the acquired assets 
additionally  in accordance with the october cci acquisition  we will pay royalties based on sales of the acquired product 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations discussed above  all of our us sales and a portion of our international sales are subject to commissions based on net sales 
a substantial portion of our global sales are subject to royalties earned based on product sales 
additionally  as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
this represents the tax benefits associated with various tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on us and international tax returns that have not been recognized in our financial statements due to uncertainty regarding their resolution 
we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the eventual cash flows by period that may be required to settle these matters 
certain of these matters may not require cash settlement due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards 
therefore  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
other liquidity information 
we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
in  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we completed a secondary offering of  shares of common stock  which generated million in net proceeds 
in  we issued million of convertible senior notes due  which generated net proceeds totaling million 
in  we purchased million aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding which we funded through a delayed draw term loan of million under our senior credit facility and cash on hand 
although it is difficult for us to predict our future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balance of approximately million  our marketable securities balances totaling million and available borrowings under the senior credit facility will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures in of approximately million  and meet our contractual cash obligations in critical accounting estimates all of our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data 
certain of our more critical accounting estimates require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions in determining the estimate 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we develop these judgments based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
our management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include revenue recognition 
our revenues are primarily generated through two types of customers  hospitals and surgery centers and stocking distributors  with the majority of our revenue derived from sales to hospitals 
our products are sold through a network of employee and independent sales representatives in the us and by a combination of employee sales representatives  independent sales representatives and stocking distributors outside the us we record revenues from sales to hospitals and surgery centers when they take title to the product  which is generally when the product is surgically implanted in a patient 
we record revenues from sales to our stocking distributors at the time the product is shipped to the distributor 
our stocking distributors  who sell the products to their customers  take title to the products and assume all risks of ownership 
our distributors are obligated to pay us within specified terms regardless of when  if ever  they sell the products 
in general  our distributors do not have any rights of return or exchange  however  in limited situations we have repurchase agreements with certain stocking distributors 
those certain agreements require us to repurchase a specified percentage of the inventory purchased by the distributor within a specified period of time prior to the expiration of the contract 
during those specified periods  we defer the applicable percentage of the sales 
approximately million and million of sales related to these types of agreements were deferred and not yet recognized as revenue as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
to do so  we analyze our historical experience related to product returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
judgment must be used and estimates made in connection with establishing the allowance for product returns in any accounting period 
our allowances for product returns of approximately million and million are included as a reduction of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
should actual future returns vary significantly from our historical averages  our operating results could be affected 
in  we entered into a trademark license agreement license agreement with kci medical resources  a subsidiary of kinetic concepts  inc kci 
in exchange for million  of which million was received immediately and million was received in january  the license agreement provides kci with a non transferable license to use our trademarks associated with our graftjacket line of products in connection with the marketing and distribution of kci s soft tissue graft containment products used in the wound care field  subject to certain exceptions 
license revenue is being recognized over years on a straight line basis 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we experience credit losses on our accounts receivable and accordingly  we must make estimates related to the ultimate collection of our accounts receivable 
specifically  we analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are from hospitals  many of which are government funded 
accordingly  our collection history with this class of customer has been favorable 
historically  we have experienced minimal bad debts from our hospital customers and more significant bad debts from certain international stocking distributors  typically as a result of specific financial difficulty or geo political factors 
we write off accounts receivable when we determine that the accounts receivable are uncollectible  typically upon customer bankruptcy or the customer s non response to continued collection efforts 
we believe that the amount included in our allowance for doubtful accounts has been a historically appropriate estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that are ultimately not collected 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  the financial condition of our customers and the geo political factors that impact reimbursement under individual countries healthcare systems can change rapidly  which would necessitate additional allowances in future periods 
our allowances for doubtful accounts were million and million  at december  and  respectively  which includes a million provision recorded in  a million provision recorded in  and a million provision recorded in for potential losses related to the trade receivable balances of certain of our non us stocking distributors 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory on a first in  first out fifo basis or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand for excess and obsolete inventory and  when circumstances indicate  we incur charges to write down inventories to their net realizable value 
our review of inventory for excess and obsolete quantities is based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate in which case we may be required to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
regardless of changes in our estimates of future product demand  we do not increase the value of our inventory above its adjusted cost basis 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  significant unanticipated decreases in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
charges incurred for excess and obsolete inventory were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  in  we recorded charges of million associated with product optimization in connection with our previously announced plans to implement a cost restructuring plan to foster growth  enhance profitability and cash flow  and build stockholder value 
goodwill and long lived assets 
we have approximately million of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment exists 
based on our single business approach to decision making  planning and resource allocation  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit for purposes of evaluating goodwill for impairment 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment may require the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of our reporting unit using projections of future cash flows 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
our business is capital intensive  particularly as it relates to surgical instrumentation 
we depreciate our property  plant and 
table of contents equipment and amortize our intangible assets based upon our estimate of the respective asset s useful life 
our estimate of the useful life of an asset requires us to make judgments about future events  such as product life cycles  new product development  product cannibalization and technological obsolescence  as well as other competitive factors beyond our control 
we account for the impairment of definite  long lived assets in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc section  property  plant and equipment fasb asc 
accordingly  we evaluate impairments of our property  plant and equipment based upon an analysis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if we determine that a change is required in the useful life of an asset  future depreciation and amortization is adjusted accordingly 
alternatively  if we determine that an asset has been impaired  an adjustment would be charged to income based on the asset s fair market value  or discounted cash flows if the fair market value is not readily determinable  reducing income in that period 
product liability claims and other litigation 
periodically  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss has been developed 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
in the third quarter of  as a result of an increase in the number and monetary amount of claims associated with fractures of our long profemur titanium modular necks  management recorded a provision for current and future claims associated with fractures of this product 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further description of this provision 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities  and we believe our accruals are adequate 
our accrual for product liability claims at december  was million  of which million was for our accrual related to long profemur titanium modular necks in north america 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits our self insured risk per policy year  and have recorded an estimate of the probable recovery related to open claims 
the estimated insurance proceeds are for current and projected claims through the end of our current coverage period  which ends in august our accrual for product liability claims was million at december  we are also involved in legal proceedings involving contract  patent protection and other matters 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and an estimate of the amount of loss can be developed 
accounting for income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction  statutory rates and tax saving initiatives available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and evaluating our tax positions 
this process includes assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
realization of deferred tax assets in each taxable jurisdiction is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits 
management evaluates deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and provides valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance balances totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to realize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of the carryforward of certain tax basis net operating losses and general business tax credits 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  effective january   which requires the tax effects of an income tax position to be recognized only if they are more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits as of the reporting date 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  income taxes 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
our liability for unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits 
we operate within numerous taxing jurisdictions 
we are subject to regulatory review or audit in virtually all of those jurisdictions  and those reviews and audits may require extended periods of time to resolve 
management makes use of all available information and makes reasoned judgments regarding matters requiring interpretation in establishing tax expense  liabilities and reserves 
we believe adequate provisions exist for income taxes for all periods and jurisdictions subject to review or audit 
stock based compensation 
we calculate the grant date fair value of non vested shares as the closing sales price on the trading day immediately prior to the grant date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
table of contents and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of these stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  which include the expected life of the award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected life of options evaluating the historical activity as required by fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
we estimate the expected stock price volatility based upon historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined using us treasury rates where the term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
expected dividend yield is not considered as we have never paid dividends and have no plans of doing so in the future 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is not currently a market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based awards are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  such stock based compensation expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
a change in assumptions may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for further information regarding our stock based compensation disclosures 
acquisition method accounting 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  business combinations  which significantly changes the accounting for acquired businesses 
effective july   this standard was incorporated into fasb asc section  business combinations fasb asc 
under this standard  an acquiring entity is required to recognize all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value 
legal fees and other transaction related costs are expensed as incurred and are no longer included in goodwill as a cost of acquiring the business 
fasb asc also requires  among other things  acquirers to estimate the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration and to recognize any subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in earnings 
in addition  restructuring costs the acquirer expected  but was not obligated to incur  will be recognized separately from the business acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in financial statements and supplementary data for information regarding our acquisitions 
restructuring charges 
we evaluate impairment issues for long lived assets under the provisions of fasb asc we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc section  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time termination benefit arrangements and other costs associated with exit activities are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc section  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we estimated the expense for our restructuring initiatives by accumulating detailed estimates of costs  including the estimated costs of employee severance and related termination benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases and any other qualifying exit costs 
such costs represented management s best estimates  which were evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment was required 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued several accounting standards updates asu that will be effective in new guidance on fair value measurements asu and on presentation of other comprehensive income asu will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the interest rates associated with our invested cash balances 
on december   we have invested short term cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
we believe that a basis point change in interest rates is reasonably possible in the near term 
based on our current level of investment  an increase or decrease of basis points in interest rates would have an annual impact of  to our interest income 
we also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our us dollar libor indexed borrowings of million 
we have entered into an interest rate swap instrument to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates 
this interest rate derivative instrument will fix the interest rate on a portion million of our libor indexed floating rate borrowings 
based on our outstanding borrowings at december   a change in interest rates would have impacted the interest expense on the unhedged portion of our debt by an immaterial amount on an annualized basis 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
cost of sales related to these sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  operating costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby partially limiting our transaction risk exposure 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries  which are denominated in the euro  from japan  which are denominated in the japanese yen  from the united kingdom  which are denominated in the british pound  and from canada  which are denominated in the canadian dollar 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro  the yen  the british pound  and the canadian dollar 
our principal exchange rate risk  therefore  exists between the us dollar and the euro  the us dollar and the yen  the us dollar and the british pound  and the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income and expense levels in the respective period 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements in financial statements and supplementary data  we enter into certain short term derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts 
these forward contracts are designed to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuations in our intercompany balances denominated in euros  japanese yen  british pounds and canadian dollars 
any change in the fair value of these forward contracts as a result of a fluctuation in a currency exchange rate is expected to be offset by a change in the value of the intercompany balance 
these contracts are effectively closed at the end of each reporting period 
at december   the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for this hypothetical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices  which can be also be affected by the change in exchange rates 
other we do not purchase or hold any market risk instruments for trading purposes
