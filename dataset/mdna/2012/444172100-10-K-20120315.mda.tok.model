item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section presents discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial condition at december  and  and consolidated results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  the company is consolidated with its wholly owned subsidiaries hudson valley bank  na and its subsidiaries collectively hvb or the bank and hvhc risk management corp 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary financial information contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview of management s discussion and analysis this overview is intended to highlight selected information included in this annual report on form k 
it does not contain sufficient information for a complete understanding of the company s financial condition and operating results and  therefore  should be read in conjunction with this entire annual report on form k 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue from providing banking and related services to businesses  professionals  municipalities  not for profit organizations and individuals within its market area  primarily westchester county and rockland county  new york  portions of new york city and fairfield county and new haven county  connecticut 
the company s assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities  which are funded by deposits  borrowings and capital 
the primary source of revenue is net interest income  the difference between interest income on loans and investments  and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
the company s basic strategy is to grow net interest income and non interest income by the retention of its existing customer base and the expansion of its core businesses and branch offices within its current market and surrounding areas 
considering current economic conditions  the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk  the risk of deterioration of market values of collateral supporting the company s loan portfolio  particularly commercial and residential real estate  and potential risks associated with the impact of regulatory changes that have occurred and may continue to take place in reaction to current conditions in the financial system 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
commercial and residential real estate are the primary collateral for the majority of company s loans 
the wide ranging economic downturn  which began in  has had negative effects on all financial sectors both domestic and foreign 
perhaps the most severe impact of this downturn has been within the real estate industry  which is a major source of both the deposit and loan businesses for the company 
the resulting decline in values and demand for both commercial and residential real estate  limited availability of funding and significant increases in bankruptcy and foreclosure filings continued throughout and the company has always had a primary focus in commercial real estate lending 
like many community banks  commercial real estate lending has been the company s largest category of lending 
during the second half of and most of  the company deployed approximately million of excess liquidity into multi family loans  a category of commercial real estate 
while not historically a strategic part of the company s lending programs  there was strong demand for those loans within the company s marketplace during and this loan category represented the majority of the company s new loans during as other categories of loans continued to experience soft demand 
while the company continued to make new loans in and  largely multi family loans  the resolution of problem classified loans remained a focus for the company 
the company worked diligently to resolve problem loans  in spite of the current protracted and difficult foreclosure process and sluggish general economic conditions 
problem loan levels remained elevated during and as part of a routine safety and soundness examination conducted by the bank s primary regulator  the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ  during late  the company was made aware that it would be required to reduce its concentration in commercial real estate and classified loans  relative to risk based 
table of contents capital 
the company s concentration in commercial real estate loans and classified loans  relative to risk based capital at december  was percent and percent  respectively 
in response  the company is planning to sell a total of approximately million in performing and non performing loans by mid  a significant step toward reducing the bank s concentrations of commercial real estate and classified loans to planned levels of percent and percent of risk based capital  respectively 
the company has reviewed its plans in detail with the occ 
while the bank may be subject to some form of administrative action in the future  the company believes it is taking decisive action to reduce these concentrations 
the transfer of these loans to held for sale at december  resulted in fair value adjustments that reduced fourth quarter net income by approximately million  after tax  or approximately per share 
lower concentrations in commercial real estate loans  historically a primary focus for lending for the company  will likely result in lower loan originations and net loan growth during and perhaps beyond 
the company recorded a net loss of million or per diluted share in  compared to net income of million or per diluted share in although both and results were negatively affected by elevated provisions for loan losses  the overall decline in earnings in  compared to  resulted primarily from a much larger provision in taken in anticipation of the million of loan sales discussed above 
the provision for loan losses totaled million  compared to million in approximately million of the provision was directly related to the fourth quarter decision to conduct the aforementioned loan sales 
earnings for and were also adversely affected by real estate owned valuation provisions of million and million  respectively  and recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale  related to the bank s investment in pooled trust preferred securities  of million and million  respectively 
non interest expense in the fourth quarter of reflects issues related to the company s investment advisor subsidiary ar schmeidler co  inc ars 
the securities and exchange commission the sec is currently conducting an investigation of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  ar schmeidler co  inc ars  relating to its compliance with certain regulatory provisions of the investment advisers act of the investigation resulted from a routine examination of ars s investment advisory business and relates to the company s brokerage practices and policies and disclosure about such practices 
the company is in discussions with the staff of the sec to settle this matter and has made accruals for such resolution as of december  at this stage in the investigation  it is reasonably possible the outcome could differ from the accrual that has been made 
management is unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional loss  if any  at this time  which could be material 
total loans  excluding million of loans held for sale  decreased million to  million during the year ended december   compared to  at the prior year end 
the decrease resulted primarily from recent actions taken by the bank to reduce its concentration in commercial real estate and level of classified loans  partially offset by significant increases in new loans throughout  primarily local market multi family loans 
overall asset quality continued to be adversely affected by the current state of the economy and the real estate market throughout nonperforming assets decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  nonperforming assets at december  included million of nonperforming loans held for sale  which are included in a loan sale expected to close in the first quarter of the company recognized million of net charge offs during the twelve month period ended december  of which million were related to the fourth quarter transfer of loans to held for sale 
total deposits increased million during the year ended december   as the company continued to experience significant growth in new customers both in existing branches and new branches added during the last two years 
overall deposit growth was partially offset by planned reductions in certain non core deposit balances 
proceeds from deposit growth were used to fund new loans  reduce maturing term borrowings  increase the securities portfolio or were retained in liquid investments  principally interest earning bank deposits 

table of contents as a result of the aforementioned activity in the company s core businesses of loans and deposits and other asset liability management activities  tax equivalent basis net interest income increased by million or percent to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in addition to evaluating hudson valley holding corp s results of operations in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  management routinely supplements this evaluation with an analysis of certain non gaap financial measures 
management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding hudson valley holding corp s underlying operating performance and trends  and facilitates comparisons with the performance of other banks 
tax equivalent basis net interest income is a non gaap financial measure 
the effect of the adjustment to a tax equivalent basis was million in and million in a tabular gaap reconciliation of net interest income is included below 
non interest income was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the overall increase resulted primarily from increases in investment advisory fees and service charges and a decrease in pre tax impairment charges on securities available for sale 
investment advisory fee income increased primarily as a result of the effects of continued improvement in both domestic and international equity markets 
pre tax impairment charges on securities available for sale were million in and million in the impairment charges were related to the company s investments in pooled trust preferred securities 
the company has continued to hold its investments in pooled trust preferred securities as it does not believe that the current market value estimates for these investments are indicative of their underlying value 
the pooled trust preferred securities are primarily backed by various us financial institutions  many of which are experiencing severe financial difficulties as a result of the current economic downturn 
continuation of these conditions may result in additional impairment charges on these securities in the future 
non interest income also included other losses of million in and million in these losses are related to sales and revaluations of other real estate owned and loans held for sale 
non interest expense was million in  an increase of million or percent  compared to million in the overall increase in non interest expense resulted primarily from the company s partial reinstatement of an incentive compensation plan previously terminated in  increases in costs associated with problem loan resolution and other real estate owned  and investment in technology and personnel to accommodate growth and the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers 
noninterest expense for also included legal and other expenses of million related to the aforementioned sec investigation of ars 
the company uses a simulation analysis to estimate the effect that specific movements in interest rates would have on net interest income 
excluding the effects of planned growth and anticipated new business  the simulation analysis at december  shows the company s net interest income decreasing slightly if rates fall and increasing slightly if rates rise 
the company has established specific policies and operating procedures governing its liquidity levels to address future liquidity needs  including contingent sources of liquidity 
while the current adverse economic situation has put pressure on the availability of liquidity in the marketplace  the company believes that its present liquidity and borrowing capacity are sufficient for its current business needs 
in addition  the company and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital guidelines 
since late  the occ has required hvb to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least 
these capital levels are in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations 
as of december   the company and hvb exceeded all required regulatory capital levels 

table of contents critical accounting policies application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and assumptions  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
the accounting policies described below are those that most frequently require management to make estimates and judgments  and therefore  are critical to understanding the company s results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
securities securities are classified as either available for sale  representing securities the company may sell in the ordinary course of business  or as held to maturity  representing securities that the company has determined that it is more likely than not that it would not be required to sell prior to maturity or recovery of cost 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax excluded from operations and reported in other comprehensive income 
securities held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
interest income includes amortization of purchase premium and accretion of purchase discount 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is determined by using the level yield method 
securities are not acquired for purposes of engaging in trading activities 
realized gains and losses from sales of securities are determined using the specific identification method 
the company regularly reviews declines in the fair value of securities below their costs for purposes of determining whether such declines are other than temporary in nature 
in estimating other than temporary impairment otti  management considers adverse changes in expected cash flows  the length of time and extent that fair value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
the company also assesses whether it intends to sell  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell  a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if either of these criteria is met  the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings 
for securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria  the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows otti related to credit loss  which must be recognized in the income statement and otti related to other factors  which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis 
loans held for sale loan sales occur in limited circumstances as part of strategic business or regulatory compliance initiatives 
loans held for sale  including deferred fees and costs  are reported at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by expected bid prices from potential investors 
loans held for sale are segregated into pools based on distinct criteria and the lower of cost or fair value analysis is performed at the pool level 
loans are sold without recourse and servicing released 
loans loans are reported at their outstanding principal balance  net of the allowance for loan losses  and deferred loan origination fees and costs 
loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and recognized over the life of the related loan or commitment as an adjustment to yield  or taken directly into income when the related loan is sold or commitment expires 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a specific component for identified problem loans  and a formula component which addresses historical loan loss experience together with other relevant risk factors affecting the portfolio 
this methodology applies to all portfolio segments 

table of contents the specific component incorporates the company s analysis of impaired loans 
a loan is recognized as impaired when it is probable that principal and or interest are not collectible in accordance with the loan s contractual terms 
in addition  a loan which has been renegotiated with a borrower experiencing financial difficulties for which the terms of the loan have been modified with a concession that the company would not otherwise have granted are considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs and are also recognized as impaired 
the company makes short term modifications that it does not consider to be tdrs in limited circumstances to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships 
the most common short term modifications are extensions of the maturity date of three months or less 
such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress  but the company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed 
these short term modifications made were not material 
measurement of impairment can be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
if the fair value of an impaired loan is less than the related recorded amount  a specific valuation component is established within the allowance for loan losses or  if the impairment is considered to be permanent  a partial charge off is recorded against the allowance for loan losses 
individual measurement of impairment does not apply to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as portions of the company s portfolios of home equity loans  real estate mortgages  installment and other loans 
the formula component is calculated by first applying historical loss experience factors to outstanding loans by type 
this component is then adjusted to reflect additional risk factors not addressed by historical loss experience 
these factors include the evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
senior management reviews these conditions quarterly 
management s evaluation of the loss related to each of these conditions is quantified by loan type and reflected in the formula component 
the evaluations of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of such evaluations and because they are not identified with specific problem credits 
actual losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the company s methodology permits adjustments to the allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors which affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date have changed 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is the best estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of december  there is no assurance that the company will not be required to make future adjustments to the allowance in response to changing economic conditions  particularly in the company s service area  since the majority of the company s loans are collateralized by real estate 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments at the time of their examinations 
loan charge offs the company s charge off policy covers all loan portfolio classes 
loans are generally charged off at the earlier of when it is determined that collection efforts are no longer productive or when they have been identified as losses by management  internal loan review and or bank examiners 
factors considered in determining whether collection efforts are no longer productive include any amounts currently being collected  the status of discussions or negotiations with the borrower  the principal and or guarantors  the cost of continuing  efforts to collect  the status of any foreclosure or legal actions  the value of the collateral  and any other pertinent factors 
other real estate owned oreo real estate properties acquired through loan foreclosure are recorded at estimated fair value  net of estimated selling costs  at time of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis 
credit 
table of contents losses arising at the time of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent valuations are periodically performed by management and the carrying value is adjusted by a charge to expense to reflect any subsequent declines in the estimated fair value 
routine holding costs are charged to expense as incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization 
identified intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over those lives by a method which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are used up 
goodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
identifiable intangible assets are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
if such testing indicates impairment in the values and or remaining amortization periods of the intangible assets  adjustments are made to reflect such impairment 
the company s goodwill impairment evaluations as of december  and december  did not indicate any impairment 
the company is not aware of any events or circumstances that existed with the identified intangible assets that would indicate impairment as of december  and december  loss contingencies loss contingencies  including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business  are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
legal fees associated with loss contingencies are included in loss contingency accruals 
income taxes income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the change is enacted 
results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  summary of results during the three years ended december   the company has experienced an extended period of severe negative economic conditions and historically low interest rates 
these conditions have resulted in sharp declines in the value of collateral securing many of the company s loans  elevated levels of classified and nonperforming loans  weak loan demand and declining margins 
in addition  a dynamically changing regulatory landscape has resulted in greater scrutiny of the historic business models of smaller community based institutions 
this has resulted in greater pressure on many community banks to reduce loan concentrations  particularly commercial real estate loans  and to accelerate the reduction of levels of nonperforming and classified loans 
the company reported a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in and million in the decrease in earnings compared to was the due primarily from the significant additions to the provision for loan losses resulting from write downs associated with the transfer of million of loans to held for sale status in contemplation of loan sales to reduce the classified loans and the concentration of commercial real estate loans 
the decrease in net income  compared to  reflected a significantly higher provision for loan losses  lower net interest income and slightly higher noninterest expense  partially offset by higher non interest income and a lower effective tax rate 
provisions for loan losses totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
non interest income includes million  million and million of pretax recognized impairment charges related to certain securities in the company s investment portfolio in  and  respectively 
non interest income also includes million  million and million of valuation losses on other real estate owned in  and  respectively 
non interest expense includes million  million and million of fdic deposit insurance premiums in  and  respectively 
the significantly higher levels of provisions 
table of contents for loan losses in and  compared to  are a direct result of the aforementioned writedowns on the loans transferred to held for sale  increases in nonperforming assets and the company s decision to follow a more aggressive strategy for problem asset resolution 
the increase is also reflective of the significantly negative effects that the ongoing economic downturn has had on the performance and collateral values of the company s loan portfolios and the overall performance of the financial services industry in general 
diluted loss per share was in  compared to diluted earnings per share of in and in these changes are a direct result of the changes in net income in the respective years compared to the prior year period 
prior period per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the percent stock dividend distributed in december returns on average stockholders equity and average assets were percent and percent for  compared to percent and percent in  and percent and percent in returns on adjusted average stockholders equity were percent  percent and percent in  and  respectively 
adjusted average stockholders equity excludes the effects of net unrealized gains  net of tax of million  million and million on securities available for sale in  and  respectively 
the annualized return on adjusted average stockholders equity is  under sec regulations  a non gaap financial measure 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure more closely reflects actual performance  as it is more consistent with the company s stated asset liability management strategies  which do not contemplate significant realization of market gains or losses on securities available for sale which were primarily related to changes in interest rates or illiquidity in the marketplace 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million or percent compared to million in  which decreased million or percent compared to million in the increase  compared to  was primarily due to an increase in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin to percent resulting from a million reduction in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities  specifically a planned reduction in borrowed funds and a change in the mix of interest earning assets resulting from the deployment of excess liquidity into loans  primarily local market multi family loans  partially offset by the effects of maturing  higher yielding loans and investments being renewed or replaced in a significantly lower interest rate environment 
the decrease compared to was primarily due to a decrease in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin to percent from percent  partially offset by million growth in the average balance of interest earning assets which was in excess of the million growth in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
the decrease in the tax equivalent basis net interest margin  compared to the prior year  resulted primarily from the effects significant increases in the average balance of low yielding interest bearing deposits in banks as a percentage of interest earning assets resulting primarily from weak loan demand  the completion of a planned reduction of the company s investment portfolio and the effects of maturing  higher yielding loans and investments being renewed or replaced in a significantly lower interest rate environment 
the provision for loan losses for was million compared to million in and million in the significant increase in compared to is directly related to million of write downs associated with the transfer of loans to held for sale status in contemplation of loan sales to reduce classified loans and the concentration of commercial real estate 
the elevated levels of the provisions are is also largely due to the negative effects on the loan portfolio of conditions resulting from the ongoing crisis in the financial markets 
as a result of the severe economic downturn  the company has experienced significant levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans and a continuation of the slowdowns in repayments and declines in the loan to value ratios on existing loans 
these conditions  together with the shortage of available residential mortgage financing  have put downward pressure on the overall asset quality of virtually all financial institutions  including the company 
the company has followed the more aggressive strategy for resolving problem assets and believes that the overall revised strategy will continue to address new and existing problem loans in the most appropriate and timely manner given current conditions in the economy 
non interest income increased million or percent to million in compared to million in  which increased million or percent compared to million in the increase of

the increase of noninterest income in  compared to the prior year period  was primarily due to increases in investment advisory fees of ar schmeidler co  inc  growth in deposit activity and other service fees and a decrease in recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale  partially offset by an increase in valuation losses on other real estate owned 
although there was significant improvement in the financial markets in and  continued improvement and the continued acquisition of new customers will be necessary for investment advisory fees to return to past levels 
the company recorded pre tax recognized impairment charges on securities available for sale of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
other dispositions of securities available for sale resulted in net realized gains of million  million and million in  and  respectively

non interest income also includes million  million and million of valuation losses on other real estate owned in  and  respectively 
non interest expense was million for  and increase of million or percent  compared to million in both and the overall increase in non interest expense resulted primarily from the company s partial reinstatement of an incentive compensation plan previously terminated in  increases in costs associated with problem loan resolution and other real estate owned  and investment in technology and personnel to accommodate growth and the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers 
increases in non interest expense resulting from the company s continued investment in its branch offices  technology and personnel to accommodate growth  the expansion of services and products available to new and existing customers  expenses related to problem loan resolution and the upgrading of certain internal processes were more than offset by cost saving measures implemented by the company during and in addition  both and reflected significantly lower fdic deposit insurance premiums compared to their respective prior year periods 
additional premiums imposed by the fdic in to replenish shortfalls in the fdic insurance fund were not imposed to the same degree in and however  additional premium increases and special assessments may continue to be imposed by the fdic in the future

during the three years ended december   the company has experienced an extended period of severe negative economic conditions and historically low interest rates 
during this period of economic difficulty and low interest rates  the company took various steps to maximize its net interest income 
these steps included repositioning its securities portfolio  reducing higher cost term borrowings and  from the second half of through  redeploying excess liquidity into new loans  primarily local market multi family loans 
these actions enabled the company to significantly offset margin compression  particularly in  resulting from interest rates continuing at historically low levels 
as previously noted  and in reaction to the occ s requirements  the company plans to sell approximately million of loans  including part of the multi family portfolio originated in and  in an effort to reduce its concentration in commercial real estate loans and its level of classified loans 
the company expects that some margin compression will result from these loan sales particularly during the period of redeployment of the proceeds 
management believes that the results of these efforts has enabled the company  given the difficulties encountered during the recent financial crisis  to maximize its net interest income  address regulatory concerns  and effectively reposition its portfolios from both asset composition and interest rate risk perspectives

other pertinent data related to the company s loan portfolio are contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
the company performs extensive ongoing asset quality monitoring by both internal and independent loan review functions 
in addition  the company conducts timely remediation and collection activities through a network of internal and external resources which include an internal asset recovery department  real estate and other loan workout attorneys and external collection agencies 
in addition  during and  the company implemented a more aggressive workout strategy for the resolution of problem assets in light of a sluggish economic recovery  continued weakness in local real estate activity and market values and growing difficulty in resolving problem loans in a timely fashion through traditional foreclosure proceedings due to increased bankruptcy filings and overcrowded court systems 
see allowance for loan losses below for further discussion of this strategy 
management believes that these efforts are appropriate for accomplishing either successful remediation or maximizing collections related to nonperforming assets 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses incurred in the loan portfolio based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the estimated losses 
the company s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of a specific component for identified problem loans and a formula component to consider historical loan loss experience and additional risk factors affecting the portfolio 
a summary of the components of the allowance for loan losses  changes in the components and the impact of charge offs recoveries on the resulting provision for loan losses for the years ended december as follows s change during change during change during change during change during components specific real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total specific component formula real estate commercial construction residential commercial and industrial lease financing and other total formula component total allowance net change net charge offs provision for loan losses the specific component of the allowance for loan losses is the result of our analysis of impaired loans and our determination of the amount required to reduce the carrying amount of such loans to estimated fair value 
accordingly  such allowance is dependent on the particular loans and their characteristics at each measurement date  not necessarily the total amount of such loans 
the company usually records partial charge offs as opposed to specific reserves for impaired loans that are real estate collateral dependent and for which independent appraisals have determined the fair value of the collateral to be less than the carrying amount of the loan 
in  the company decided to implement a more aggressive workout strategy for the resolution of problem assets in light of a sluggish economic recovery  continued weakness in local real estate activity and market values and growing difficulty in resolving problem loans in a timely fashion through traditional foreclosure proceedings due to increased bankruptcy filings and overcrowded court systems 
the severity of the decline in real estate values has provided new market opportunities for the disposition of distressed assets as investors search for yield in the current low interest rate environment and our more aggressive policy may be able to take advantage of those opportunities 
as part of the revised resolution strategy  the company has reevaluated each problem loan and has made a determination of net realizable value based on management s estimation of the best probable outcome considering 
table of contents the individual characteristics of each asset against the likelihood of resolution with the current borrower  expectations for resolution through the court system  or other available market opportunities including potential loan sales 
the effects of this new strategy are reflected in significant charge offs  as well as a million decrease in the formula component of the allowance at december  compared to december  the million increase in the specific component at december  resulted from additional specific reserves needed for one loan compared to december  on december   the company transferred million of loans into the held for sale category

at december   the company had million of specific reserves allocated to one impaired loan 
there were million of specific reserves allocated to three impaired loans as of december  the company s analyses as of december  and december  indicated that impaired loans were principally real estate collateral dependent and that  with the exception of those loans for which specific reserves were assigned  there was sufficient underlying collateral value or guarantees to indicate expected recovery of the carrying amount of the loans 
the formula component is calculated by first applying historical loss experience factors to outstanding loans by type  excluding loans for which a specific allowance has been determined 
this component is then adjusted to reflect additional risk factors not addressed by historical loss experience 
these factors include the evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
senior management reviews these conditions quarterly 
management s evaluation of the loss related to these conditions is quantified by loan type and reflected in the formula component 
the evaluations of the incurred loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty due to the subjective nature of such evaluations and because they are not identified with specific problem credits 
the changes in the formula component of the allowance for loan losses are the result of the application of historical loss experience to outstanding loans by type 
loss experience for each year is based upon average charge off experience for the prior three year period by loan type 
the formula component is then adjusted to reflect changes in other relevant factors affecting loan collectibility 
management periodically adjusted the formula component to an amount that  when considered with the specific component  represented its best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date

the company s methodology permits adjustments to the allowance in the event that  in management s judgment  significant factors which affect the collectibility of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date have changed 
by assessing the estimated losses probable in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  the bank is able to adjust specific and probable loss estimates based upon any more recent information that has become available 
other pertinent information related to the company s allowance for loan losses is contained in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented in this form k 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is the best estimate of probable losses which have been incurred as of december  there is no assurance that the company will not be required to make future adjustments to the allowance in response to changing economic conditions or regulatory examinations 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million during  million for and million in the provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the company s allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management based on the factors previously discussed under allowance for loan losses 
deposits the company s fundamental source of funds supporting interest earning assets is deposits  consisting of non interest bearing demand deposits  checking with interest  money market  savings and various forms of time deposits 
the maintenance of a strong deposit base is key to the development of lending opportunities and creates long term customer relationships  which enhance the ability to cross sell services 
depositors include businesses  professionals  municipalities  not for profit organizations and individuals 
to meet the requirements of a diverse customer base  a full range of deposit instruments are offered  which has allowed the company to maintain and expand its deposit base despite intense competition from other banking institutions and non bank financial service providers 

table of contents total deposits at december  increased million or percent to  million  from  million at december   which increased million or percent from  million at december  the company has experienced significant growth in new customers both in existing branches and new branches added during and this growth was partially offset by some declines in balances of existing customers  primarily those customers directly involved in or supported by the real estate industry 
proceeds from deposit growth were used primarily to reduce long term and short term borrowings and to fund loan growth 
the company had no brokered certificates of deposit at december  and the following table presents a summary of deposits at december s demand deposits money market accounts savings accounts time deposits of  or more time deposits of less than  checking with interest total deposits at december  and  certificates of deposit including other time deposits of  or more totaled million and million  respectively

these cd s are primarily short term and are acquired on a bid basis 
time deposits of over  generally have maturities of to days 
the company also utilizes wholesale borrowings  brokered deposits and other sources of funds interchangeably with time deposits in excess of  depending upon availability and rates paid for such funds at any point in time 
due to the generally short maturity of these funding sources  the company can experience higher volatility of interest margins during periods of both rising and declining interest rates 
at december  and  the company had no brokered deposits

as of december   hvb had short term borrowing lines with the fhlb of million with no amounts outstanding 
these and various other fhlb borrowing programs available to members are subject to availability of qualifying loan and or investment securities collateral and other terms and conditions 
hvb also has unsecured overnight borrowing lines totaling million with three major financial institutions which were all unused and available at december  in addition  hvb has approved lines under retail certificate of deposit agreements with three major financial institutions totaling billion of which no balances were outstanding as at december  utilization of these lines are subject to product availability and other restrictions 
additional liquidity is also provided by the company s ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
in response to the current economic crisis  the federal reserve bank has increased the ability of banks to borrow from this source through its borrower in custody bic program  which expanded the types of collateral which qualify as security for such borrowings 
hvb has been approved to participate in the bic program 
there were no balances outstanding with the federal reserve at december  as of december   the company had qualifying loan and investment securities totaling approximately million which could be utilized under available borrowing programs thereby increasing liquidity 

table of contents capital resources stockholders equity decreased million or percent to million at december  from million at december   which decreased million or percent from million at december  the decrease resulted from cash dividends of million and net loss of million which was partially offset by net proceeds from exercises of stock options of million and an increase of accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
the decrease resulted from cash dividends of million which was partially offset by net income of million  net proceeds from exercises of stock options of million and an increase of accumulated other comprehensive income of million 
hvb s payment of dividends to the company  the company s primary source of funds  is subject to limitation by federal and state regulators based on such factors as the maintenance of adequate capital  which could reduce the amount of dividends otherwise payable 
see business supervision and regulation 
the various components and changes in stockholders equity are reflected in the consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity for the years ended december   and included elsewhere herein 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system issued a supervisory letter dated february  to bank holding companies that contains guidance on when the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate  defer or severely limit dividends including  for example  when net income available for stockholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends 
the letter also contains guidance on the redemption of stock by bank holding companies which urges bank holding companies to advise the federal reserve of any such redemption or repurchase of common stock for cash or other value which results in the net reduction of a bank holding company s capital during the quarter 
all banks and bank holding companies are subject to risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines define capital as tier and total capital 
tier capital consists of common stockholders equity and qualifying preferred stock  less intangibles  and total capital consists of tier capital plus the allowance for loan losses up to certain limits  preferred stock and certain subordinated and term debt securities 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of percent  and a minimum tier risk based capital ratio of percent 
banks and bank holding companies must also maintain a minimum leverage ratio of percent  which consists of tier capital based on risk based capital guidelines  divided by average tangible assets excluding intangible assets that were deducted to arrive at tier capital 
in today s economic and regulatory environment  banking regulators  including the occ  which is the primary federal regulator of the bank  are directing greater scrutiny to banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans 
due to the concentration of commercial real estate loans in our portfolio  we are among the banks subject to such greater regulatory scrutiny 
as a result of this concentration  the level of our non performing loans  and the potential for further possible deterioration in our loan portfolio  the occ required hvb to maintain  since december   a total risk based capital ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent compared to percent for a well capitalized bank 
these capital levels are in excess of well capitalized levels generally applicable to banks under current regulations 

table of contents the capital ratios at december  are as follows tier capital company hvb total capital company hvb leverage company hvb in connection with the company s efforts to reduce certain asset concentrations as they relate to capital  the board has adopted a dividend policy to cap dividend payments going forward at no more than percent of quarterly net income in and in future periods if commercial real estate loans and classified assets exceed percent and percent of risk based capital  respectively 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the aforementioned loan sales had been completed on december   before any reinvestment  the bank subsidiary would have recorded a total risk based capital ratio of percent  a tier risk based capital ratio of percent  a tier leverage ratio of percent  a cre concentration of percent of risk based capital  and classified assets of percent of risk based capital 
management intends to conduct the affairs of the bank so as to maintain a strong capital position in the future 
liquidity the asset liability strategic committee alsc of the board of directors of hvb establishes specific policies and operating procedures governing the company s liquidity levels and develops plans to address future liquidity needs  including contingent sources of liquidity 
the primary functions of asset liability management are to provide safety of depositor and investor funds  assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirement of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to manage fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
the company s liquid assets  at december   include cash and due from banks of million and federal funds sold of million 
federal funds sold represents the company s excess liquid funds that are invested with other financial institutions in need of funds and which mature daily 
other sources of liquidity include maturities and principal and interest payments on loans and securities 
the loan and securities portfolios provide a constant stream of maturing assets and reinvestable cash flows  which can be converted into cash should the need arise 
the ability to redeploy these funds is an important source of medium to long term liquidity 
the amortized cost of securities having contractual maturities  expected call dates or average lives of one year or less amounted to million at december  this represented percent of the amortized cost of the securities portfolio 
excluding installment loans to individuals  real estate loans other than construction loans and lease financing  million  or percent of loans at december   mature in one year or less 
the company may increase liquidity by selling certain residential mortgages  or exchanging them for mortgage backed securities that may be sold in the secondary market 

table of contents non interest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits from businesses  professionals  not for profit organizations and individuals are a relatively stable  low cost source of funds 
the deposits of the bank generally have shown a steady growth trend as well as a generally consistent deposit mix 
however  there can be no assurance that deposit growth will continue or that the deposit mix will not shift to higher rate products 
the bank is a member of the fhlb 
as such  we are able to participate in various fhlb borrowing programs which require certain investments in fhlb common stock as a prerequisite to obtaining funds 
as of december   hvb had short term borrowing lines with the fhlb of million with no balances outstanding 
these and various other fhlb borrowing programs available to members are subject to availability of qualifying loan and or investment securities collateral and other terms and conditions 
the bank also has unsecured overnight borrowing lines totaling million with three major financial institutions which were all unused and available at december  in addition  hvb has approved lines under retail certificate of deposit agreements with three major financial institutions totaling approximately billion which were also unused and available at december  the retail certificates of deposit lines are subject to product availability and other restrictions 
additional liquidity is also provided by the bank s ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank s discount window 
in response to the current economic crisis  the federal reserve bank has increased the ability of banks to borrow from this source through its borrower in custody bic program  which expanded the types of collateral which qualify as security for such borrowings 
the bank has been approved to participate in the bic program 
there were no amounts outstanding with the federal reserve at december  the various borrowing programs discussed above are subject to certain restrictions and terms and conditions which may include continued availability of such borrowing programs  the company s ability to pledge qualifying collateral in sufficient amounts  the company s maintenance of capital ratios acceptable to these lenders and other conditions which may be imposed on the company 
as of december   the company had qualifying loan and investment securities totaling approximately million which could be utilized under available borrowing programs thereby increasing liquidity 
the company also has outstanding  at any time  a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third parties 
these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments 
guarantees specify limits to the company s obligations 
because many commitments and almost all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
the company is also obligated under leases or license agreements for certain of its branches and equipment 

table of contents a summary of significant long term contractual obligations and credit commitments at december  follows payments due within year after year but within years after year but within years after years total contractual obligations time deposits fhlb borrowings operating lease and license obligations total credit commitments available lines of credit letters of credit total interest not included 
fhlb borrowings are presented in the above table by contractual maturity date 
the fhlb has rights  under certain conditions  to call million of those borrowings as of various dates during and quarterly thereafter 
the company pledges certain of its assets as collateral for deposits of municipalities and other deposits allowed or required by law  fhlb and frb borrowings and repurchase agreements 
by utilizing collateralized funding sources  the company is able to access a variety of cost effective sources of funds 
the assets pledged consist of certain loans secured by real estate  us treasury and government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  certain obligations of state and political subdivisions and other securities 
management monitors its liquidity requirements by assessing assets pledged  the level of assets available for sale  additional borrowing capacity and other factors 
management does not anticipate any negative impact to its liquidity from its pledging activities 
another source of funding for the company is capital market funds  which includes common stock  preferred stock  convertible debentures  retained earnings and long term debt qualifying as regulatory capital 
each of the company s sources of liquidity is vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond the control of the company 
scheduled loan and security payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan and security prepayments and calls  and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by general market interest rates and other unforeseen market conditions 
the company s ability to borrow to meet liquidity demands or to do so at attractive rates is affected by its financial condition and other market conditions 
management expects that the company has and will have sources of liquidity to meet any expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets

the credit mark established through this transfer of loans increased the fourth quarter s provision by million 
the large fluctuation in the provision for loan losses in the second quarter of resulted primarily from a million provision recorded  which is reflective of an increase in nonperforming assets and the company s decision to follow a more aggressive strategy for problem asset resolution

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market indices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
since all company transactions are denominated in us dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposures  the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
if more liabilities than assets reprice in a given period a liability sensitive position or negative gap  market interest rate changes will be reflected more quickly in liability rates 
if interest rates decline  such positions will generally benefit net interest income 
alternatively  where assets reprice more quickly than liabilities in a given period an asset sensitive position or positive gap  a decline in market rates could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
excessive levels of interest rate risk can result in a material adverse effect on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  effective risk management techniques that maintain interest rate risk at prudent levels is essential to the company s safety and soundness 
the company has no financial instruments entered into for trading purposes 
federal funds  both purchases and sales  on which rates change daily  and loans and deposits tied to certain indices  such as the prime rate and federal discount rate  are the most market sensitive and have the most stable fair values 
the least sensitive instruments include long term fixed rate loans and securities and fixed rate savings deposits  which have the least stable fair value 
on those types falling between these extremes  the management of maturity distributions is as important as the balances maintained 
management of maturity distributions involve the matching of interest rate 
table of contents maturities  as well as principal maturities  and is a key determinant of net interest income 
in periods of rapidly changing interest rates  an imbalance gap between the rate sensitive assets and liabilities can cause major fluctuations in net interest income and in earnings 
establishing patterns of sensitivity which will enhance future growth regardless of frequent shifts in the market conditions is one of the objectives of the company s asset liability management strategy 
evaluating the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is the responsibility of alsc and includes assessing both the adequacy of the management process used to control interest rate risk and the quantitative level of exposure 
when assessing the interest rate risk management process  the company seeks to ensure that appropriate policies  procedures  management information systems and internal controls are in place to maintain interest rate risk at appropriate levels 
evaluating the quantitative level of interest rate risk exposure requires the company to assess the existing and potential future effects of changes in interest rates on its consolidated financial condition  including capital adequacy  earnings  liquidity and asset quality 
the company uses the simulation analysis to estimate the effect that specific movements in interest rates would have on net interest income 
this analysis incorporates management assumptions about the levels of future balance sheet trends  different patterns of interest rate movements  and changing relationships between interest rates ie basis risk 
these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior 
for a given level of market interest rate changes  the simulation can consider the impact of the varying behavior of cash flows from principal prepayments on the loan portfolio and mortgage backed securities  call activities on investment securities  balance changes on non contractual maturity deposit products demand deposits  checking with interest  money market and savings accounts  and embedded option risk by taking into account the effects of interest rate caps and floors 
the impact of planned growth and anticipated new business activities is not integrated into the simulation analysis 
the company can assess the results of the simulation and  if necessary  implement suitable strategies to adjust the structure of its assets and liabilities to reduce potential unacceptable risks to net interest income 
the simulation analysis at december  shows the company s net interest income increasing moderately if rates rise and decreasing slightly if rates fall 
these simulation results will be directionally consistent and somewhat elevated as the company sells and redeploys the cash proceeds from approximately million in loans classified as held for sale at december  the company s policy limit on interest rate risk is that if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease basis points from current rates  the percentage change in estimated net interest income for the subsequent month measurement period should not decline by more than percent 
net interest income is forecasted using various interest rate scenarios that management believes are reasonably likely to impact the company s financial condition 
a base case scenario  in which current interest rates remain stable  is used for comparison to other scenario simulations 
the table below illustrates the estimated exposures under a rising rate scenario and a declining rate scenario calculated as a percentage change in estimated net interest income from the base case scenario  assuming a gradual shift in interest rates for the next month measurement period  beginning december  and gradual change in interest rates percentage change in estimated net interest income from december  percentage change in estimated net interest income from december  basis points basis points since  a basis point downward change was substituted for the basis point downward scenario previously used  as management believes that a basis point downward change is not a meaningful analysis in light of current interest rate levels 
the percentage change in estimated net income in the and basis points scenario is within the company s policy limits 

table of contents as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  there are certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented 
actual results may differ significantly from simulated results should market conditions and management strategies  among other factors  vary from the assumptions used in the analysis 
the model assumes that certain assets and liabilities of similar maturity or period to repricing will react the same to changes in interest rates  but  in reality  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
specific types of financial instruments may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while other types of financial instruments may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  other assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
furthermore  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and securities and early withdrawals from time deposits could deviate significantly from those assumed in the simulation 
one way to minimize interest rate risk is to maintain a balanced or matched interest rate sensitivity position 
however  profits are not always maximized by matched funding 
to increase net interest earnings  the company selectively mismatches asset and liability repricing to take advantage of short term interest rate movements and the shape of the us treasury yield curve 
the magnitude of the mismatch depends on a careful assessment of the risks presented by forecasted interest rate movements 
the risk inherent in such a mismatch  or gap  is that interest rates may not move as anticipated 
interest rate risk exposure is reviewed in quarterly meetings in which guidelines are established for the following quarter and the longer term exposure 
the structural interest rate mismatch is reviewed periodically by alsc and management 
the company also prepares a static gap analysis 
balance sheet items are appropriately categorized by contractual maturity  expected average lives for mortgage backed securities  or repricing dates  with prime rate indexed loans and certificates of deposit 
checking with interest accounts  savings accounts  money market accounts and other borrowings constitute the bulk of the floating rate category 
the determination of the interest rate sensitivity of non contractual items is arrived at in a subjective fashion 
savings accounts are viewed as a relatively stable source of funds and are therefore classified as intermediate funds 
at december   the static gap showed a positive cumulative gap of million in the one day to one year repricing period  as compared to a positive cumulative gap of million at december  the change in the cumulative static gap between december  and december  reflects the results of the company s efforts to reposition its portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates and changes to the shape of the yield curve 
management believes that this strategy has enabled the company to be well positioned for the next cycle of interest rate changes and to address conditions which may arise as a result of the current financial crisis
