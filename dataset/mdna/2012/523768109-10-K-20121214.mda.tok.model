item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations and financial condition as of  and for each of the three years ended  september  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included herein 
non gaap financial measures no non gaap financial measure should be considered as a substitute for any related financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
however  we believe the use of non gaap financial measures provides meaningful supplemental information with which to evaluate our financial performance  or assist in forecasting and analyzing future periods 
we also believe such non gaap financial measures are alternative indicators of performance used by investors  lenders  rating agencies and financial analysts to estimate the value of a publishing business or its ability to meet debt service requirements 
operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin operating cash flow is defined as operating income loss before depreciation  amortization  impairment of goodwill and other assets  curtailment gains and equity in earnings of associated companies 
operating cash flow margin is defined as operating cash flow divided by operating revenue 
both represent non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
we believe these measures provide meaningful supplemental information because of their focus on results from operations excluding such non cash factors 
reconciliations of operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin to operating income loss and operating income loss margin  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are included in the table below thousands of dollars percent of revenue percent of revenue percent of revenue operating cash flow depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and other assets curtailment gains equity in earnings of associated companies reduction in investment in tni operating income loss nm adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share  which are defined as income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share adjusted to exclude both unusual matters and those of a substantially non recurring nature  are non gaap financial measures that are used in the analysis below 
we believe these measures provide meaningful supplemental information by identifying matters that are not indicative of core business operating results or are of a substantially non recurring nature 
reconciliations of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share to income loss attributable to lee enterprises  incorporated and earnings loss per common share  respectively  the most directly comparable measures under gaap  are set forth in item  included herein  under the caption overall results 
same property comparisons certain information below  as noted  is presented on a same property basis  which is exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures  if any  consummated in the current or prior year 
we believe such comparisons provide meaningful supplemental information for an understanding of changes in our revenue and operating expenses 
same property comparisons exclude tni and mni 
we own of tni and also own of the capital stock of mni  both of which are reported using the equity method of accounting 
same property comparisons also exclude corporate office costs 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information follows with regard to certain of the most critical of our accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets  we annually assess qualitative factors affecting our business to determine if the probability of a goodwill impairment is more likely than not 
our assessment includes reviewing internal and external factors affecting our business such as cash flow projections  stock price and other industry or market considerations 
this assessment is normally made in the last fiscal quarter of each year 
we analyze goodwill and other nonamortized intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
such indicators of impairment include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate and operating or cash flow losses related to such assets 
should we determine that a goodwill impairment is more likely than not  we make a determination of the fair value of our business 
fair value is determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future revenue  expenses and cash flows discounted to their present value  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples of various financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the publishing industry 
a non cash impairment charge will generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of the business exceeds its estimated fair value 
should we determine that a nonamortized intangible asset impairment is more likely than not  we make a determination of the individual asset s fair value 
fair value is determined using the relief from royalty method  which estimates fair value based upon appropriate royalties of future revenue discounted to their present value 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of such asset 
the required valuation methodology and underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by us 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows 
changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 
due primarily to the difference between our stock price and the per share carrying value of our net assets  we analyzed the carrying value of our net assets in continued deterioration in our revenue and the weak economic environment were also factors in the timing of the analyses 
we concluded the fair value of our business did not exceed the carrying value of our net assets in as a result  we recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  nonamortized and amortizable intangible assets in additional pretax  non cash charges were recorded to reduce the carrying value of tni 
we also recorded pretax  non cash charges to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment in  and we recorded deferred income tax benefits related to these charges 
a summary of impairment charges is included in the table below thousands of dollars continuing operations goodwill nonamortized intangible assets amortizable intangible assets property and equipment reduction in investment in tni discontinued operations we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset or asset group with their carrying amount 
the impairment amount  if any  is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
we also periodically evaluate our determination of the useful lives of amortizable intangible assets 
any resulting changes in the useful lives of such intangible assets will not impact our cash flows 
however  a decrease in the useful lives of such intangible assets would increase future amortization expense and decrease future reported operating results and earnings per common share 
future decreases in our market value  or significant differences in revenue  expenses or cash flows from estimates used to determine fair value  could result in additional impairment charges in the future 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans we evaluate our liability for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit plans based upon computations made by consulting actuaries  incorporating estimates and actuarial assumptions of future plan service costs  future interest costs on projected benefit obligations  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates  expected investment returns on plan assets  asset allocation assumptions of plan assets  and other factors 
if we used different estimates and assumptions regarding these plans  the funded status of the plans could vary significantly  resulting in recognition of different amounts of expense over future periods 
increases in market interest rates  which may impact plan assumptions  generally result in lower service costs for current employees  higher interest expense and lower liabilities 
actual returns on plan assets that are lower than the plan assumptions will generally result in decreases in a plan s funded status and may necessitate additional contributions 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method  whereby deferred income tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards and deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
changes in accounting for uncertain tax positions can result in additional variability in our effective income tax rate 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
we file income tax returns with the internal revenue service irs and various state tax jurisdictions 
from time to time  we are subject to routine audits by those agencies  and those audits may result in proposed adjustments 
we have considered the alternative interpretations that may be assumed by the various taxing agencies  believe our positions taken regarding our filings are valid  and that adequate tax liabilities have been recorded to resolve such matters 
however  the actual outcome cannot be determined with certainty and the difference could be material  either positively or negatively  to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss in the periods in which such matters are ultimately determined 
we do not believe the final resolution of such matters will be material to our consolidated financial position or cash flows 
revenue recognition advertising revenue is recorded when advertisements are placed in the publication or on the related digital product 
circulation revenue is recorded over the print or digital product subscription term or as such newspapers are individually sold 
other revenue is recognized when the related product or service has been delivered 
unearned revenue arises in the ordinary course of business from advance subscription payments for print or digital products or advance payments for advertising 
uninsured risks we are self insured for health care  workers compensation and certain long term disability costs of our employees  subject to stop loss insurance  which limits exposure to large claims 
we accrue our estimated health care costs in the period in which such costs are incurred  including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims 
other risks are insured and carry deductible losses of varying amounts 
our accrued reserves for health care and workers compensation claims are based upon estimates of the remaining liability for retained losses made by consulting actuaries 
the amount of workers compensation reserve has been determined based upon historical patterns of incurred and paid loss development factors from the insurance industry 
an increasing frequency of large claims  deterioration in overall claim experience or changes in federal or state laws affecting our liability for such claims could increase the volatility of expenses for such self insured risks

operating cash flow and results of operations as a result of the factors noted above  operating cash flow decreased  to  in compared to  in operating cash flow margin increased to in from in  reflecting a larger percentage decrease in operating expenses than the decrease in operating revenue 
depreciation expense decreased  or  in and amortization expense decreased  or  in due primarily to the difference between our stock price and the per share carrying value of our net assets  we analyzed the carrying value of our net assets in continued deterioration in our revenue and the weak economic environment were also factors in the timing of the analysis

curtailment treatment was utilized in situations in which coverage was eliminated 
curtailment gains were calculated by revaluation of plan liabilities after consideration of other plan changes 
the patient protection and affordable care act  along with its companion reconciliation legislation together the affordable care act  were enacted into law in the affordable care act will be supported by a substantial number of underlying regulations  some of which have not been issued 
accordingly  a complete determination of the impact of the affordable care act cannot be made at this time 
however  we expect our future health care costs to increase more rapidly based on analysis published by the united states department of health and human services  input from independent advisors and our understanding of various provisions of the affordable care act that differ from our current medical plans 
we may be able to mitigate certain of these future cost increases through changes in plan design 
we do not expect the affordable care act will have a significant impact on our postretirement medical benefit obligation liability 
equity in earnings in associated companies increased  in the factors noted above resulted in operating income of  in compared to an operating loss of  in nonoperating income and expense financial expense increased  or  to  in due primarily to higher interest rates on our debt

the increase in is due to the chapter proceedings 
debt reduction accounted for the majority of the remaining usage of funds in all years 
the plan requires us to suspend stockholder dividends and share repurchases through december as discussed more fully below and certain capitalized terms used below defined  in january  in conjunction with the effectiveness of the plan  we refinanced all of our debt 
the plan refinanced our then existing credit agreement and extended the april maturity in a structure of first and second lien debt with the existing lenders 
we also amended the pulitzer notes  and extended the april maturity with the existing noteholders 
st lien agreement in january  we entered into a credit agreement the st lien agreement with a syndicate of lenders the st lien lenders 
the st lien agreement consists of a term loan of  and a new  revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also supports issuance of letters of credit 
interest payments debt under the st lien agreement bears interest  at our option  at either a base rate or an adjusted eurodollar rate libor  plus an applicable margin 
the base rate for the facility is the greater of a the prime lending rate of deutsche bank trust company americas at such time  b in excess of the overnight federal funds rate at such time  or c day libor plus 
libor loans are subject to a minimum rate of 
the applicable margin for term loan base rate loans is  and for libor loans 
the applicable margin for revolving credit facility base rate loans is  and is for libor loans 
at september   all borrowing under the st lien agreement is based on libor at a total rate of 
principal payments at september   the balance outstanding under the term loan is  we may voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding or reduce commitments under the st lien agreement at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  upon proper notice and subject to certain limitations as to minimum amounts of prepayments 
we are required to repay principal amounts  on a quarterly basis until maturity  under the st lien agreement 
principal payments are required quarterly beginning in june  and total  in   in   in and  in  prior to the final maturity 
in addition to the scheduled payments  we are required to make mandatory prepayments under the st lien agreement under certain other conditions  such as from the net proceeds from asset sales 
the st lien agreement also requires us to accelerate future payments in the amount of our quarterly excess cash flow  as defined 
the acceleration of such payments due to future asset sales or excess cash flow does not change the due dates of other st lien agreement payments prior to the december maturity 
payments made under the st lien agreement are summarized as follows thousands of dollars mandatory voluntary asset sales excess cash flow there were no net principal payments made in under the previous credit agreement 
since september   principal payments under the st lien agreement total  security the st lien agreement is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by all of our existing and future  direct and indirect subsidiaries in which we hold a direct or indirect interest of more than the credit parties  provided however  that our wholly owned subsidiary pulitzer inc pulitzer and its subsidiaries are not credit parties 
the st lien agreement is secured by first priority security interests in the stock and other equity interests owned by the credit parties in their respective subsidiaries 
the credit parties have also granted a first priority security interest on substantially all of their tangible and intangible assets  and granted mortgages covering certain real estate  as collateral for the payment and performance of their obligations under the st lien agreement 
assets of pulitzer and its subsidiaries  tni  our ownership interest in  and assets of  mni and certain employee benefit plan assets are excluded 
however  assets of pulitzer and its subsidiaries  excluding tni  become subject to a first priority security interest of the credit parties upon repayment in full of the pulitzer notes  as discussed more fully below 
the revolving credit facility has a super priority security interest over all of the collateral securing the term loan under the st lien agreement  superior to that of the term loan lenders 
covenants and other matters the st lien agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for financing of its type 
these financial covenants include a maximum total leverage ratio  as defined 
the total leverage ratio is designed to assess the leverage of the company  excluding pulitzer  and does not reflect our overall leverage position due to the lower leverage of pulitzer 
it is based primarily on the sum of the principal amount of debt under the st lien agreement  plus debt under the nd lien agreement  as discussed more fully below  which totals  at september   plus letters of credit and certain other factors  divided by a measure of trailing month operating results  which includes distributions from mni and other elements  but excludes the operating results of pulitzer 
our actual total leverage ratio at september  under the st lien agreement was our maximum total leverage ratio covenant will decrease  in stages  from at september  to in december on a consolidated basis  using the definitions in the st lien agreement  our leverage ratio is at september  this consolidated measure is not the subject of a covenant in any of our debt agreements 
the st lien agreement also includes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio  as defined  which is based on the sum of interest expense  as defined  incurred under the st lien agreement and nd lien agreement  divided by the same measure of trailing month operating results discussed above 
the interest expense coverage ratio is similarly designed to assess the interest coverage of the company  excluding pulitzer  and does not reflect our overall interest coverage position 
our actual interest expense coverage ratio at september was our minimum interest expense coverage ratio covenant will decrease  in stages  from at september  to in december the st lien agreement requires us to suspend stockholder dividends and share repurchases through december the st lien agreement also limits capital expenditures to  per year  with a provision for carryover of unused amounts from the prior year 
further  the st lien agreement restricts our ability to make additional investments  acquisitions  dispositions and mergers without the consent of the st lien lenders and limits our ability to incur additional debt 
such covenants require that substantially all of our future cash flows are required to be directed toward debt reduction or accumulation of cash collateral and that the cash flows of the credit parties are largely segregated from those of pulitzer 
nd lien agreement in january  we entered into a second lien term loan the nd lien agreement with a syndicate of lenders the nd lien lenders 
the nd lien agreement consists of a term loan of  the nd lien agreement bears interest at  payable quarterly 
principal payments and redemption the nd lien agreement requires no principal amortization  except in march if required for income tax purposes

pulitzer notes in conjunction with its formation in  st 
louis post dispatch llc pd llc borrowed  the pulitzer notes from a group of institutional lenders the noteholders 
the pulitzer notes were guaranteed by pulitzer pursuant to a guaranty agreement with the noteholders 
the aggregate principal amount of the pulitzer notes was payable in april in february  the pulitzer notes and the guaranty agreement described below were amended the notes amendment 
under the notes amendment  pd llc repaid  of the principal amount of the debt obligation 
the remaining debt balance of  was refinanced by the noteholders until april in january  in connection with the plan  we entered into an amended note agreement and guaranty agreement which amended the pulitzer notes and extended the maturity with the noteholders 
after consideration of unscheduled principal payments totaling   in december and  in january  offset by  of non cash fees paid to the noteholders in the form of additional pulitzer notes debt  the amended pulitzer notes had a balance of  in january the pulitzer notes bear interest at  increasing in january and january of each year thereafter 
due to the increasing interest rate  interest on the pulitzer notes is charged to expense using a calculated effective interest rate during the period 
this method increased financial expense  from the amount actually payable to the noteholders during this period 
principal payments at september   the balance of the pulitzer notes is  we may voluntarily prepay principal amounts outstanding under the pulitzer notes at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  upon proper notice  and subject to certain limitations as to minimum amounts of prepayments 
the pulitzer notes provide for mandatory scheduled annual prepayments totaling  in and  annually thereafter 
in addition to the scheduled payments  we are required to make mandatory prepayments under the pulitzer notes under certain other conditions  such as from the net proceeds from asset sales 
the pulitzer notes also require us to accelerate future payments in the amount of our quarterly excess cash flow  as defined 
the acceleration of such payments due to future asset sales or excess cash flow does not change the due dates of other pulitzer notes payments prior to the final maturity in december payments made under the pulitzer notes are summarized as follows thousands of dollars prior to refinancing pursuant to the plan  net mandatory voluntary asset sales excess cash flow since september   principal payments under the pulitzer notes total  security the guaranty agreement provides that obligations under the pulitzer notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by pulitzer s existing and future subsidiaries other than tni

covenants and other matters the pulitzer notes contain certain covenants and conditions including the maintenance  by pulitzer  of minimum trailing month ebitda minimum of  at september   as defined in the guaranty agreement  and limitations on capital expenditures and the incurrence of other debt 
further  the pulitzer notes have limitations or restrictions on distributions  loans  advances  investments  acquisitions  dispositions and mergers 
such covenants require that substantially all future cash flows of pulitzer are required to be directed first toward repayment of the pulitzer notes or accumulation of cash collateral and that cash flows of pulitzer are largely segregated from those of the credit parties 
intercreditor agreements the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement and pulitzer notes contain cross default provisions tied to each of the various agreements 
intercreditor agreements and an intercompany subordination agreement are in effect 
other cash payments to the lenders  noteholders and legal and professional fees related to the plan totaled  of which  was paid in  and the remainder of which was paid in  of such costs were charged to expense in in addition  previously capitalized financing costs of  at september  were charged to expense in as debt financing costs prior to consummation of the plan  with the remainder classified as reorganization costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss upon consummation of the plan 
debt under the plan was considered compromised 
as a result  the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement and pulitzer notes were recorded at their respective present values  which resulted in a discount to the stated principal amount totaling  this amount is being amortized as a non cash component of financial expense over the terms of the related debt 
such amounts totaled  in and are estimated to total  in   in   in   in and  in debt is summarized as follows amount interest rates thousands of dollars september september september st lien agreement nd lien agreement credit agreement a term loan revolving credit facility pulitzer notes unaccreted unamortized present value adjustment less current maturities of debt current amount of present value adjustment total long term debt at september   our weighted average cost of debt is 
aggregate maturities of debt total  in   in   in   in and  in liquidity at september   after consideration of letters of credit  we have approximately  available for future use under our revolving credit facility 
including cash  our liquidity at september  totals  this liquidity amount excludes any future cash flows 
we expect all interest and principal payments due in the next twelve months will be satisfied by our continuing cash flows  which will allow us to maintain an adequate level of liquidity 
there are numerous potential consequences under the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement  and the note and guaranty agreements related to the pulitzer notes  if an event of default  as defined  occurs and is not remedied 
many of those consequences are beyond our control 
the occurrence of one or more events of default would give rise to the right of the st lien lenders  nd lien lenders and or the noteholders  to exercise their remedies under the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement  and the note and guaranty agreements  respectively  including  without limitation  the right to accelerate all outstanding debt and take actions authorized in such circumstances under applicable collateral security documents 
our ability to operate as a going concern is dependent on our ability to remain in compliance with debt covenants and to refinance or amend our debt agreements as they become due  or earlier if available liquidity is consumed 
we are in compliance with our debt covenants at september  at december   the principal amount of our outstanding debt totals  this amount is already less than the  amount projected in the plan in september lower cash balances and asset sales have contributed to the improvement in debt repayment compared to the plan 
in  we filed a form s shelf registration statement shelf with the sec  which has been declared effective 
the shelf gives us the flexibility to issue and publicly distribute various types of securities  including preferred stock  common stock  secured or unsecured debt securities  purchase contracts and units consisting of any combination of such securities  from time to time  in one or more offerings  up to an aggregate amount of  in july  the sec announced changes to the issuer eligibility rules which will require us to have a public float of at least  in order to use the shelf 
subject to maintenance of the minimum level of equity market float and the conditions of our existing debt agreements  the shelf may enable us to sell securities quickly and efficiently when market conditions are favorable or financing needs arise 
net proceeds from the sale of any securities must be used generally to reduce debt 
other matters cash and cash equivalents decreased  in and increased  in and  in seasonality our largest source of publishing revenue  retail advertising  is seasonal and tends to fluctuate with retail sales in markets served 
historically  retail advertising is higher in the december and june quarters 
advertising revenue is lowest in the march quarter

inflation price increases or decreases for our products are implemented when deemed appropriate by us 
we continuously evaluate price increases  productivity improvements  sourcing efficiencies and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of inflation 
changes in laws and regulations energy costs energy costs have become more volatile  and may increase in the future as a result of carbon emissions and other regulations being developed by the united states environmental protection agency 
health care costs the affordable care act was enacted into law in as a result  in we wrote off  of deferred income tax assets due to the loss of future tax deductions for providing retiree prescription drug benefits 
the affordable care act will be supported by a substantial number of underlying regulations  some of which have not been issued 
accordingly  a complete determination of the impact of the affordable care act cannot be made at this time 
however  we expect our future health care costs to increase more rapidly based on analysis published by the united states department of health and human services  input from independent advisors and our understanding of various provisions of the affordable care act that differ from our current medical plans  such as cost of a transitional reinsurance program to fund state level programs  certain preventive services provided at no cost to employees  higher maximum age for dependent coverage  elimination of annual and lifetime benefit caps  and  free choice vouchers for certain lower income employees 
administrative costs are also likely to increase as a result of new compliance reporting 
new costs being imposed on other medical care businesses  such as health insurers  pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers  may be passed on to us in the form of higher costs 
we may be able to mitigate certain of these future cost increases through changes in plan design 
we do not expect the affordable care act will have a significant impact on our postretirement medical benefit obligation liability 
pension plans in july  the surface transportation extension act of stea was signed into law 
stea provides for changes in the determination of discount rates that result in a near term reduction in minimum funding requirements for our defined benefit pension plans 
stea will also increase future premiums to be paid to the pension benefit guarantee corporation 
income taxes certain states in which we operate are considering changes to their corporate income tax rates 
at this time  the impact of such changes cannot be determined 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at september  thousands of dollars payments or commitments due years nature of obligation total less than more than debt principal amount financial expense operating lease obligations capital expenditure commitments maturities of long term debt are limited to mandatory payments and  accordingly  exclude excess cash flow  asset sale and other payments required under the st lien agreement and the pulitzer notes as such amounts cannot be determined 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
financial expense includes an estimate of interest expense for the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement and pulitzer notes until their maturities in december  april and december  respectively 
financial expense under the st lien agreement is estimated based on the day minimum libor level of as increased by our applicable margin of applied to the outstanding balance  as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt 
financial expense under the nd lien agreement is estimated using the contractual rate applied to the outstanding balance during each period  as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt 
financial expense under the pulitzer notes is estimated based on the contractual interest rates applied to the outstanding balance at september   as reduced by future contractual maturities of such debt 
changes in interest rates in excess of the minimum libor level  use of borrowing rates not based on libor  use of interest rate hedging instruments  and or principal payments in excess of contractual maturities or based on other requirements of the st lien agreement  nd lien agreement or pulitzer notes could significantly change this estimate 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
financial expense excludes non cash present value adjustments and amortization of debt financing costs previously paid 
additionally  interest expense based on the effective interest rate of the pulitzer notes is also excluded 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
the table above excludes future cash requirements for pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations 
the periods in which these obligations will be settled in cash are not readily determinable and are subject to numerous future events and assumptions 
we estimate cash requirements for these obligations in will total approximately  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
the table above also excludes future cash requirements  if any  for the payment of the herald value to be settled between april and april the estimated value of the herald value at september  is  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included herein 
commitments exclude unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes 
we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities for such matters 
a substantial amount of our deferred income tax liabilities is related to acquisitions and will not result in future cash payments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  exposure to certain of these market risks is managed as described below 
interest rates on debt our debt structure and interest rate risk are managed through the use of fixed and floating rate debt 
our primary exposure is to libor 
a basis point increase or decrease to libor would  if in excess of libor minimums discussed more fully below  decrease or increase  respectively  income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately  based on  of floating rate debt outstanding at september  our debt under the st lien agreement is subject to minimum interest rate levels of 
based on the difference between interest rates in december and our minimum rate  libor would need to increase approximately basis points for six month borrowing up to approximately basis points for one month borrowing before our borrowing cost would begin to be impacted by an increase in interest rates 
at september   approximately of the principal amount of our debt is subject to floating interest rates 
we regularly evaluate alternatives to hedge the related interest rate risk 
certain of our interest earning assets  including those in employee benefit plans  also function as a natural hedge against fluctuations in interest rates on debt 
commodities certain materials used by us are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage this risk through instruments such as purchase orders and non cancelable supply contracts 
we participate in a buying cooperative with other publishing companies  primarily for the acquisition of newsprint 
we are also involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and operating efficiencies 
primary commodity price exposures are newsprint and  to a lesser extent  ink and energy costs 
north american newsprint producers continue to deleverage under difficult market conditions as they continue to face significant declines in domestic demand as well as weakening export demand 
three of these companies exited us and or canadian financial reorganization protection in september and october other producers have also reacted with extended production downtime or permanent closure of facilities as well as converting paper machines to other paper grades 
the high cost of attaining recycled fibers has led to significant reductions in the availability of newsprint with recycled content 
newsprint pricing has remained relatively stable since mid selected west coast producers have announced a per metric tonne increase on pound newsprint  effective throughout the december calendar quarter 
the increase was precipitated primarily by a mill closure and the tightening of supply on the west coast 
this increase  as well as future price changes  if any  will be influenced primarily by the balance between supply capacity and demand  domestic and export  in addition to the producers ability to mitigate input cost pressures 
the final extent of future price change announcements  if any  is subject to negotiations with each newsprint producer 
a per tonne price increase for pound newsprint would result in an annualized reduction in income before income taxes of approximately  based on anticipated consumption in  excluding consumption of tni and mni and the impact of lifo accounting 
such prices may also decrease 
we manage significant newsprint inventories  which may help to mitigate the impact of future price increases 
sensitivity to changes in value our fixed rate debt consists of the nd lien agreement and pulitzer notes  which are not traded on an active market and are held by small groups of investors 
we are unable  as of september   to measure the maximum potential impact on fair value of fixed rate debt from adverse changes in market interest rates under normal market conditions 
the change in value  if determined  could be significant
