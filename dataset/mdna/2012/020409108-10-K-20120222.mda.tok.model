item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  visiting nurse vn and personal care pc 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in asc topic  segment reporting 
our vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or an hourly basis 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program while the balance is generated from medicaid and private insurance programs 
our pc segment services are also provided in patients homes 
these services generally provided by paraprofessional staff such as home health aides are generally of a custodial rather than skilled nature 
pc revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
approximately of the pc segment revenues are generated from medicaid and other government programs while the balance is generated from insurance programs and private pay patients 
our view on reimbursement and diversification of risk our company is highly dependent on government reimbursement programs which pay for the majority of the services we provide to our patients 
reimbursement under these programs  primarily medicare and medicaid  is subject to frequent changes as policy makers balance their own needs to meet the health care needs of constituents while also meeting their fiscal objectives 
medicare and medicaid are consuming a greater percentage of federal and states budgets  respectively  which is exacerbated in times of economic downturn 
we believe that these financial issues are cyclical in nature rather than indicative of the long term prospect for medicare and medicaid funding of health care services 
additionally  we believe our services offer the lowest cost alternative to institutional care and are a part of the solution to both balancing the federal budget and the states medicaid financing problems 
we believe that an important key to our historical success and to our future success is our ability to adapt our operations to meet changes in reimbursement as they occur 
one important way in which we have achieved this adaptability in the past  and in which we plan to achieve it in the future  is to maintain some level of diversification in our business mix 
the execution of our business plan will place primary emphasis on the development of our home health operations 
as our business grows we may evaluate opportunities for the provision of other health care services in patients homes that would be consistent with our senior advocacy mission 
our business plan our future success depends on our ability to execute our business plan 
over the next three to five years we will try to accomplish the following generate meaningful same store sales growth through the focused provision of high quality services and attending to the needs of our patients  expand the significance of our home health services by selectively acquiring other quality providers  through the startup of new agencies and potentially by providing new services in patients homes consistent with our senior advocacy mission  and expand our capital base through both earnings performance and by seeking additional capital investments in our company 

table of contents health care reform legislation and medicare regulations the us congress has been pursuing a comprehensive reform of the us healthcare system since early numerous changes have been enacted  proposed and continue to be debated 
many of the change provisions do not take effect for an extended period of time and most will require the publication of implementing regulations and or the issuance of programmatic guidelines 
refer to part i  item  government regulations and part i  item a  risk factors 
recently a number of efforts have been made by certain members of congress to repeal or otherwise slow implementation 
also  there have been a number of court cases filed challenging the legality of the legislation on constitutional and other grounds 
in our view it is reasonable to expect these activities to continue to occur over the next few years 
additionally  very often  sweeping new legislation is followed by subsequent legislation to address previously unanticipated consequences  or to further define provisions that were too vague to implement based on the language of the original legislation 
as a result of the broad scope of the legislation  the significant changes it will effect in the healthcare industry and society generally  and the complexity of the technical issues it addresses  we are unable to predict  at this time  all the ramifications the legislation and the implementing regulations may have on our business as a health care provider or a sponsor of an employee health insurance benefit plan 
the legislation and implementing regulations and programmatic guidelines could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition in ways not currently anticipated by us 
independent of the legislation medpac annually issues a report to the congress on medicare payment policy in which it makes specific recommendations for payment policy changes for all categories of providers including home health 
we are unable to predict what future recommendations may be 
additionally  we are unable to predict whether  or in what form  the congress or cms might implement medpac s historical or future recommendations 
it is reasonable to expect that the legislation might have a more immediate and negative impact on those providers generating lower margins than us  with more leverage relative to earnings than us  with less capital resources than us  or with less ability to adapt their operations 
certain aspects of the legislation appear to align with certain recommendations of medpac 
medpac suggests  in connection with its recommendation for a rebasing or recalculation of home health reimbursement rates  that such change may result in some agencies exiting medicare 
based on this and our own interpretation of the potential implications of such a rebasing  we believe that the legislation may result in a contraction of the number of home health providers 
in the event of such a contraction in the number of providers  we believe the surviving providers may benefit from a higher rate of admissions growth than would have otherwise occurred 
those surviving providers may earn incremental margins on those higher admissions that may serve to offset a portion of the rate reduction from the medicare program 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting such higher admissions 
it is also reasonable to expect that the rate cuts  if enacted as presently outlined  will present additional opportunities for us to make acquisitions of other providers at valuations and on terms that are attractive to us and enable us to spread our segment and unallocated corporate overhead expenses across a larger business base 
however there can be no assurance that we will be successful in making such acquisitions 
there has been a great deal of legislative and regulatory change enacted or proposed in the last several months and  not all implementing regulations have been published 
additionally  as also indicated above it is reasonable to expect more changes 
such changes may similarly increase our costs  decrease our revenues  expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business 
refer to the results of operations for the impact of these items on revenue  operating and net income for the years ended december  and management is currently working to evaluate the implications of these changes and to develop appropriate courses of action for the company 
additionally  we may be unable to take actions to mitigate any or all of the negative implications of the legislation and implementing regulations or programmatic guidelines 
given the broad and far reaching implications of all these changes  the incomplete nature of these changes  the pace at which the changes are taking place and the prospects for future changes to be made  we cannot predict the 
table of contents ultimate impact  which may be material and adverse  that health care reform efforts and resulting medicare reimbursement rates will have on our liquidity  our results of operations  the realizability of the carrying amounts of our intangible assets  including goodwill  or our financial condition 
further  we are unable to predict what effect  if any  such material adverse effect  if it were to occur  might have on our ability to continue to comply with the financial covenants of our revolving credit facility and our ability to continue to access debt capital through that facility 
we may contemplate formulating and taking actions intended to mitigate or otherwise offset some of the negative effects of reimbursement changes 
these actions may include any or all of the following attempting to increase our revenues by investing more resources in sales and marketing activities  development of diagnosis related specialty programs and increasing our educational programs regarding the value of home health to drive admission growth  establishing startup branch operations to expand our service territories  and acquisitions of underperforming providers with strong referral relationships  attempting to reduce our costs by developing a more efficient delivery model  increasing the productivity standards for our staff  optimizing the appropriate use of different levels of professional staff  limiting or eliminating the growth in wage rates  limiting or reducing the size of our work force  closing unprofitable branch operations and accelerating our efforts to evaluate the use of various technological approaches to the delivery of patient care to improve patient outcomes and or improve the productivity of our workforce  evaluating the potential implications of health care reform on our employee benefit plans  and possible changes we may need to make to our plans  and potentially other actions we deem appropriate including evaluation of potential additional service offerings in patients homes consistent with our senior advocacy mission or changing the mix of the types of services we provide 
although we will attempt to mitigate or otherwise offset the negative effect of health care reform on our reimbursement revenue and our employee benefit plans  our actions may not ultimately be cost effective or prove successful
