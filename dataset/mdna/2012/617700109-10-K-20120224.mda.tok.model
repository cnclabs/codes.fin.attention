table of contents key business characteristics revenue we generate revenue by selling a variety of investment related products and services 
we sell many of our offerings  such as newsletters  principia software  and premium service on morningstar 
com  via subscriptions 
these subscriptions are mainly offered for a one year term  although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years 
we also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world 
several of our other products are sold through license agreements  including morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar equity research  morningstar direct  retirement solutions  licensed data and some of our structured credit research and ratings offerings 
our license agreements typically range from one to three years 
for some of our other institutional services  mainly investment consulting  we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement 
we also earn fees relating to morningstar managed portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management 
overall  revenue tied to asset based fees accounted for about of our consolidated revenue in deferred revenue we frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
as a result  we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development 
the businesses we acquired over the past several years have similar business models  and as a result  we acquired their deferred revenue 
deferred revenue is the largest liability on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled million as of december  and million as of december  we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription  license  and service agreements 
significant operating leverage our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content 
we strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographical markets 
in general  our businesses have high fixed costs  and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on internet based platforms and assets under management 
at times  we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short term operating results 
during other periods  our profitability may improve because we re able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate 
when revenue decreases  however  the operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability 
operating expense we classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold  development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization  as described below 
we include stock based compensation expense  as appropriate  in each of these categories 
cost of goods sold 
this category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers 
for example  this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports 
cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as postage  printing  and cd rom replication  as well as shareholder servicing fees for morningstar managed portfolios 
development 
this category includes compensation expense for programmers  designers  and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products 
in some cases  we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects 
this reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category 
we amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software  which is generally three years  and include this expense in depreciation and amortization 

table of contents sales and marketing 
this category includes compensation expense for our sales teams  product managers  and other marketing professionals 
we also include the cost of advertising  direct mail campaigns  and other marketing programs to promote our products 
general and administrative 
this category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team  as well as human resources  finance  and support employees for each segment 
the category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs  including corporate systems  finance and accounting  legal  and facilities expense 
depreciation and amortization 
our capital expenditures consist of computers  leasehold improvements  and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects 
we depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight line method based on the useful life of the asset  which ranges from three to seven years 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life  which is generally three years 
we also include amortization related to intangible assets  which is mainly driven by acquisitions  in this category 
we amortize intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic useful lives  which range from one to years 
international operations we have majority owned operations in countries outside of the united states and include these in our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our minority owned investments in japan and sweden using the equity method 
how we evaluate our business when our analysts evaluate a stock  they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows  discounted to their worth in today s dollars 
our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way 
our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time  which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders 
we do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price  or to take actions that help us meet short term forecasts but may not be in the long term interest of building shareholder value 
we provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time revenue including organic revenue  operating income loss  and free cash flow  which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
organic revenue is considered a non gaap financial measure under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
we define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations 
we present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period to period results  and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is also considered a non gaap financial measure 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

table of contents to evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue  we calculate a retention rate 
we use two different methods for calculating retention 
for subscription based products including our print newsletters  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and principia software  we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year 
for products sold through contracts and licenses  we use the contract value method  which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period 
we include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount  unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify 
we also include variable fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage 
the retention rate excludes setup and customization fees  migrations to other morningstar products  and contract renewals that were pending as of january  the year in review industry overview we monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis 
we use these insights to help inform our company strategy  product development plans  and marketing initiatives 
global markets posted disappointing returns in as investors wrestled with uncertainty stemming from the european debt crisis  lackluster economic recovery  and monetary tightening in key emerging markets like china 
markets were characterized by sharp volatility  and investors gravitated towards safer asset classes  such as long term treasuries  high quality dividend stocks  and gold 
following strong market gains in  the us market finished with only a slight positive return 
morningstar s us market index  a broad market benchmark  ended the year up only 
however  the developed ex us index and the emerging markets index fared much worse losing and in total us mutual fund assets declined to trillion as of december   compared with trillion as of december   based on data from the investment company institute ici 
although aggregate cash flows to mutual funds were slightly positive for the year  investors continued to heavily favor fixed income funds rather than equity funds 
us stock funds suffered about billion in net outflows during  based on morningstar s analysis of fund flow trends  while fixed income funds had more than billion in net inflows 
global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend  with total assets increasing but asset flows favoring fixed income funds 
investors have also continued to favor passively managed index funds rather than actively managed portfolios 
this trend continued in  as passively managed vehicles had nearly billion in net inflows  compared with billion of net inflows for active products both mutual funds and etfs 
the number of mutual funds in the united states was essentially unchanged excluding multiple share classes  with about  funds in both and based on data from the ici 
the number of global mutual funds increased to about  as of september   compared with  as of september   based on ici data 
we estimate that single strategy hedge funds included in morningstar s database had about billion in net inflows for the year to date through november   up from billion in net inflows through november  etfs continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds 
the us etf industry closed out with more than trillion in assets under management based on data from the ici  up from about billion at the end of based on data from comscore  aggregate page views to financial and investment sites in declined by about in compared with  while the number of pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit were each down roughly 
the number of unique visitors  meanwhile  was down about 
we believe these trends reflect individual investors continuing lower level of interest in financial and investment related content in the wake of the market downturn 
metrics such as pages viewed per visit and unique visitors showed similar trends for morningstar 
com  and pages per visit and time spent per visit showed larger declines 

table of contents despite these trends  we believe online advertising spending by financial services companies was generally healthy for most of magna global  a division of interpublic group  estimates that global online advertising revenue rose about across all industries in  following a increase in in the wake of the financial crisis of and  regulators have continued to implement new rules for financial services companies globally 
many of these relate to financial advisor compensation  fees and expenses  investor disclosure  and the use of hedge funds and alternative investments 
in the united kingdom  for example  the retail distribution review rdr  which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees  higher professional standards for financial advisors  and an emphasis on whole of market investment solutions  is scheduled to come into effect in january advisors will be required to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles including funds  etfs  and other products and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias 
we believe this requirement may increase the business need for investment information on multiple investment types  which we offer through products such as morningstar direct and morningstar advisor workstation 
in the european union  undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities ucits is a set of eu directives designed to enable funds to operate across the eu based upon authorization from one state regulator 
ucits iv  which came into effect in july  included requirements for a new key investor information document kiid  an easy to read annual factsheet that replaces the simplified prospectus 
every ucits fund that is promoted to retail investors is now required to produce a kiid and issue an updated copy each year 
we believe our data and production capabilities will allow us to help fund companies produce and distribute these documents 
in australia  the government is implementing a series of future of financial advice reforms scheduled to go into effect starting in july many of these related to fiduciary standards and compensation structures for financial advisors 
in the united states  president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank into law in july dodd frank creates a number of new regulatory  supervisory  and advisory bodies and touches on the regulation of virtually every aspect of us financial markets and activities 
dodd frank also left numerous matters to be addressed through rulemaking and other regulatory action  giving the regulators significant discretion in many areas 
as a result  the final shape and effect of the legislation are continuing to emerge 
dodd frank included a number of corporate governance and disclosure requirements that apply to publicly traded companies generally 
it also included changes to the regulatory framework for credit rating agencies granting the sec more oversight over nationally recognized statistical rating organizations nrsros  including our morningstar credit ratings formerly realpoint subsidiary 
while we believe dodd frank and related regulations will not have a significant effect on morningstar other than morningstar credit ratings  we continue to monitor the potential impact on our clients

because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years  comparing our financial results from year to year is complex 
to make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods  we provide information on both organic revenue  which reflects our underlying business excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations  and revenue from acquisitions 
we include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for months after we complete the acquisition 
after that  we include it in organic revenue 
consolidated organic revenue revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under gaap

table of contents retention and renewal rates as discussed in how we evaluate our business  we calculate retention and renewal rates to help measure how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue 
the following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years 
akrenewalretentionjpg 
for contract based products and services such as licensed data  investment consulting  morningstar direct  and morningstar advisor workstation  we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was between and  within the same range as while aggregate renewal rates were broadly similar for both years  renewal rates for some larger products  including licensed data and morningstar advisor workstation  were slightly lower compared with the previous year 
these declines were offset by slightly higher renewal rates for institutional software  investment consulting  and retirement solutions 
the figure for contract based products includes the effect of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal  as well as changes in the value of variable fee contracts

incentive compensation and employee benefit costs represented approximately  or million  of the overall operating expense increase 
the increase in incentive compensation included higher bonus expense and an increase in sales commissions

some of our contracts include minimum fee levels that provide us with a flat payment up to a specified asset level  above which we also receive variable asset based fees

fees for these services may be based on the level of assets under advisement in these arrangements 
we do not disclose a fee range for our investment consulting and retirement solutions businesses because our fee structures vary by client

we disclose changes in the nature of the underlying services we provide or their associated fee structures for example  a change from flat fees to asset based fees in our periodic filings to the extent that they are material to our financial results 
for morningstar managed portfolios  we charge asset based fees  which are based on a tiered schedule that depends on the client s account balance

as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included a current liability of million and a non current liability of million for unrecognized tax benefits 
these amounts include interest and penalties  less any associated tax benefits 
we have not provided federal and state income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  because these earnings have been permanently reinvested 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents  and investments as of december  are held by our operations outside of the united states 
as such  we believe that our cash balances and investments in the united states  along with cash generated from our us operations  will be sufficient to meet our us operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future  without requiring us to repatriate earnings from these foreign subsidiaries 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings 

table of contents we are currently under audit by federal and various state and local tax authorities in the united states  as well as tax authorities in certain non us jurisdictions 
it is likely that the examination phase of some of these audits will conclude in it is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources we believe our available cash balances and investments  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next months 
we invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
we maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high quality stand alone credit ratings 
we also invest a small portion of our investments balance less than as of december  in proprietary morningstar portfolios 
these portfolios may consist of stocks  bonds  options  mutual funds  or exchange traded funds 
investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years  the weighted average maturity is approximately one year 
approximately of our cash  cash equivalents  and investments as of december  are held by our operations in the united states 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents  and investments for general corporate purposes  including working capital and funding future growth 
to date  we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit 
in  we paid dividends of million 
on december   our board of directors approved a payment of a regular quarterly dividend of cents per share payable on january  to shareholders of record as of january  as of december   we recorded a liability for dividends payable of million

the dividend is payable on april  to shareholders of record as of april  in december  the board approved an increase to the million share repurchase program it announced in the board approval authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional million in shares of our outstanding common stock 
we may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of  shares for million under this authorization

these items  which increased our cash  cash equivalents  and investments balance  were partially offset by million used to repurchase common stock through our share repurchase program  million of capital expenditures  and million of dividends paid 
we expect to use a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of to make annual bonus payments of approximately million 
cash provided by operating activities our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  driven by million of net income  adjusted for non cash items and changes in our net operating assets and liabilities of million 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities mainly benefited from an increase in accrued compensation and an increase in income taxes 
the growth in accrued compensation primarily reflects the bonus liability as of year end  partially offset by the bonus payments made in the first quarter of of approximately million 
the cash flow benefit of income taxes was partially offset by tax payments of million made during cash provided by operating activities in also reflects million of payments for previously announced separation agreements with two former executives

cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions  purchases of investments less proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments  and cash used for capital expenditures 
the level of investing activities varies from period to period depending on activity in these three categories 
cash used for investing activities was million in  million in  and million in in  purchases of investments exceeded the proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments by million 
in contrast  proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments exceeded the purchases of investments by million in in  we transferred funds from our investment portfolio to cash and cash equivalents to pay for acquisitions made in purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the maturity and sale of investments  were million in as of december  and  we had investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  of million and million  respectively

the capital expenditures reflect spending on computer hardware and software and internally developed capitalized software for our us office as well as remaining payments for our development center in china 
the capital expenditures include spending for our office space in shenzhen  china 
capital expenditures in include final payments for the build out of our new headquarters in chicago and investment for a couple of our office locations in europe 
we expect to make total capital expenditures of approximately million in  primarily for computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations  and capitalized software 
we did not complete any acquisitions in  but received cash of approximately million as an adjustment to the purchase price of one of our acquisitions 
in  we completed seven acquisitions for million  net of cash acquired 
the majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of realpoint  obsr  morningstar denmark  and the annuity intelligence business of advanced sales and marketing corp

cash provided by used for financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
these cash inflows may be offset by dividend payments and cash used to repurchase outstanding common stock through our share repurchase program 
excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant 
similarly  the vesting of restricted stock units generates excess tax benefits when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units 
these excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized 
it is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units 
as a result  we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time 
note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december  in  cash used for financing activities was million

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
if actual amounts are different from previous estimates  we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications  software  and internet based products and services 
we recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we also provide analysis  consulting  retirement advice  and other services 
we recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition  including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable 
for contracts that combine multiple products and services  we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately 
delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue 
if arrangements include an acceptance provision  we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance 
we make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether or not collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed on a case by case basis 
we typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections 
deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions  licenses  or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
as of december   our deferred revenue was million 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations 
the amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions 
the timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations 
we believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate  and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 

table of contents purchase price allocation over the past several years  we have acquired several companies that complement our business operations 
over the past three years  the total cash paid for acquisitions  less cash acquired  was million 
as of december   we have recorded million of goodwill arising from acquisitions 
as of december   we allocated million of gross value to intangible assets  primarily for customer related assets  technology based assets  and intellectual property 
the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from one to years 
management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities 
for each acquisition  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and goodwill in accordance with asc  business combinations 
once it has been determined that recognition of an asset or liability in a business combination is appropriate  the asset or liability generally is measured at fair value in accordance with the principles of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the determination of the fair values of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in each of the following areas identify the acquired intangible assets for each acquisition  we identify the intangible assets acquired 
these intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships  trademarks and tradenames  technology related intangibles including internally developed software and databases  and non compete agreements 
estimate the fair value of these intangible assets we consider various approaches to value the intangible assets 
these valuation approaches include the cost approach  which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility  the market approach  which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets  and the income approach  which measures the value of an asset based by measuring the present worth of the economic benefits it is expected to produce 
estimate the remaining useful life of the assets for each intangible asset  we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset 
for example  for customer relationships  we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates 
for technology related assets such as databases  we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life 
for internally developed software  we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software 
assess the appropriate method for recording amortization expense over the intangible asset s useful life we use judgment to determine the rate at which the amortization expense should be recognized 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the method of amortization should reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
if that pattern cannot be reliably determined  a straight line amortization method should be used 
based on this guidance  we amortize intangible assets over their expected useful life using a straight line amortization method 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets  the amount of amortization and depreciation expense  if any  recorded in our consolidated statements of income  and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods 

table of contents goodwill goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  it is subject to an impairment test annually  or whenever indicators of impairment exist  based on a discounted cash flow model 
an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit 
in  we altered the definition of our reporting units to align with the definition of our operating segments 
this realignment occurred because of our successful efforts to integrate acquired businesses and leverage proprietary content across multiple products 
as a result  the businesses that previously represented components of our operating segments no longer met the criteria for recognition as reporting units 
our reporting units constitute businesses for which discrete financial information  which is regularly reviewed by management  is available 
we performed annual impairment reviews in the fourth quarter of   and and did not record any impairment losses in these years  reflecting our assessment that our estimates of fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long term horizon 
we update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
this would result in a non cash charge  adversely affecting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of property  equipment  and capitalized software  net of accumulated depreciation  and million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
in accordance with fasb asc  subsequent measurement impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  equipment  capitalized software  and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events or changes may include deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
they are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories 
our stock based compensation expense primarily reflects grants of restricted stock units and restricted stock 
under fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
we measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant 
we estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
we ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 

table of contents instead  different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period 
because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year  we adjust the stock based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested 
in addition  we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our us and us operations  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions 
tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  are permanent 
other differences  such as depreciation expense  reverse over time 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million and gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
the deferred tax assets include million of deferred tax assets related to million of net operating losses nols of our non us operations 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately million of the non us nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future  we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance 
these adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed 
this would cause our income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
we assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
we use judgment to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns 
we adjust these liabilities  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
we use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities 
it typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations  which we describe in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
these legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties  and government actions 
assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment 
if actual results differ from our assessments  our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would be impacted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates  market prices  or adverse security selection 
we invest our investment portfolio mainly in high quality fixed income securities

based on our estimates  a basis point change in interest rates would impact the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately million 
as our non us revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue  fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk 
our european operations are subject to currency risk related to the euro 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging  and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk 
our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the us dollar 
in addition  because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars
