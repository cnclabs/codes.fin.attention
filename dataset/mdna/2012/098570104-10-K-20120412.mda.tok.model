com 
as of january   the company employed approximately  full and part time employees 
one of the company s growth strategies is focused on opening stores in new and existing market areas 
in addition to opening new stores  management intends to continue its practice of reviewing the profitability trends and prospects of existing stores and closing or relocating under performing stores 
during fiscal  the company opened stores  closed stores and relocated one store 
the company s performance is partially measured based on comparable store sales  which is similar to most retailers 
comparable store sales are determined each fiscal quarter during the year based on all stores that have been open at least full months as of the first day of the fiscal period 
any stores closed during a fiscal quarter are included in comparable store sales until they close 
remodeled and relocated stores are also included as comparable stores 
the factors affecting the future trend of comparable store sales include  among others  overall demand for products the company sells  the company s marketing programs  pricing strategies  store operations  and competition 

table of contents current economic environment the united states and global economies continue to experience challenging times  including high levels of unemployment  and it is possible that current economic conditions could persist or deteriorate further 
the company believes that these conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on spending by the company s current retail customer base and potential new customers 
because of these significant challenges  we are continuously reviewing and adjusting our business activities to address the changing economic environment 
we are carefully managing our inventory and liquidity and enforcing expense controls while working diligently and prudently to grow our business 
the company s year end inventory balance increased in fiscal  while overall store square footage increased 
the company opened new stores  closed stores and relocated one store in fiscal because of the uncertainty in the overall economic environment  the unpredictability of consumer behavior and the concern as to whether economic conditions will improve  it is very difficult for us to predict how our business may be affected in the future 
our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a further decline in business and consumer spending  including limited or further reduced availability of credit  continued high or increased unemployment levels  higher energy and fuel costs  rising interest rates  financial market volatility  and a long term economic downturn 
these conditions could have a negative impact on the earnings  liquidity  and capital resources of the company

table of contents critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company believes that the likelihood is remote that materially different amounts will be reported related to actual results for the estimates and judgments described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the financial results for the weeks ended january  contain certain insignificant reclassifications necessary to conform to the presentation of the weeks ended january  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation on equipment and furniture and fixtures is provided on the straight line method over the estimated service lives  which range from two to ten years 
depreciation of buildings and amortization of leasehold improvements  including remodels  is provided on the straight line basis over the lesser of the assets estimated useful lives ranging from to years or  if applicable  the periods of the leases 
determination of useful asset life is based on several factors requiring judgment by management and adherence to generally accepted accounting principles for depreciable periods 
judgment used by management in the determination of useful asset life could relate to any of the following factors expected use of the asset  expected useful life of similar assets  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life  and other factors that may impair the economic useful life of the asset 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
improvement costs are capitalized to property accounts and depreciated using applicable annual rates 
the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold  retired or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts  and the related gain or loss is credited or charged to income 
at january   the company had million of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  accounting for approximately of the company s total assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company evaluates long lived assets for impairment at the individual store level  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  the company will first compare the carrying amount of the assets to the individual store s estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss calculation is prepared 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the assets to the individual store s fair value based on its estimated discounted future cash flows 
if required  an impairment loss is recorded for that portion of the asset s carrying value in excess of fair value 
impairment losses  excluding goodwill impairment  totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
for both years presented  the impairment losses related to the retail trade business segment 
goodwill at january   the company had million of goodwill  accounting for approximately of the company s total assets 
asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other unamortizable intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually or earlier if there are impairment indicators 
the company first makes a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
if it is determined that impairment testing should be performed  the company performs a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill as required by asc the first step of this test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of the impairment 
the company completed its annual impairment test on the goodwill during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that no impairment charge was necessary 
the company has noted no subsequent indicators of impairment 
changes in market conditions  among other factors  could have a material impact on these estimates 
closed store expenses management considers several factors in determining when to close or relocate a store 
some of these factors are decreases in store sales from the prior year  decreases in store sales from the current year budget  annual measurement of individual store pre tax future net cash flows  indications that an asset no longer has an economically useful life  remaining term of an individual store lease  or other factors that would indicate a store in the current location cannot be profitable 
when the company closes or relocates a store  the company charges unrecoverable costs to expense 
such costs include the net book value of abandoned fixtures and leasehold improvements  lease termination costs  costs to transfer inventory and usable 
table of contents fixtures  other costs in connection with vacating the leased location  and a provision for future lease obligations  net of expected sublease recoveries 
costs associated with store closings of million and million  including discontinued operations  during fiscal and  respectively  are included in operating  selling  and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
inventories inventories are counted throughout the fiscal year 
store inventory counts are performed by an independent inventory service  while warehouse inventory counts are performed internally 
all physical inventory counts are reconciled to the company s records 
the company s accrual for inventory shortages is based upon historical inventory shortage results 
cost is assigned to store and warehouse inventories using the retail inventory method 
using this method  store and warehouse inventories are valued by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that is widely used within the retail industry 
inventory costing also requires certain significant management estimates and judgments involving markdowns  the allocation of vendor allowances and shrinkage 
these practices affect ending inventories at cost as well as the resulting gross margins and inventory turnover ratios 
the company estimates and accrues shrinkage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date 
the accrual is calculated based on historical results 
as this estimate is based on historical experience  the variances between the estimate of shrinkage and the adjustment resulting from physical inventories are traditionally not significant 
reserves for markdowns are estimated based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
our estimates have traditionally not been significantly different from actual markdowns taken 
the company utilizes the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for inventories 
the cumulative difference between replacement and current cost of inventory over stated lifo value was million as of january  and million as of january  the estimated replacement cost of inventory at january  was the current first in  first out fifo value of million 
vendor allowances the company receives allowances from its vendors under a variety of programs and arrangements  including merchandise placement and cooperative advertising programs 
the company accounts for these allowances under the provisions of asc  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which addresses the accounting for vendor allowances 
vendor allowances in excess of incremental direct costs are reflected as a reduction of inventory costs and recognized in cost of products sold upon the sale of the related inventory 
accrued expenses on a monthly basis  certain material expenses are estimated and accrued to properly record those expenses in the period incurred 
such estimates include those made for payroll and employee benefits costs  occupancy costs and advertising expenses among other items 
certain estimates are made based upon analysis of historical results 
differences in management s estimates and assumptions could result in accruals that are materially different from the actual results 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that result in temporary differences between the amounts recorded in its financial statements and tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
seasonality and quarterly results similar to many retailers  the company s business is seasonal  with its highest retail sales  gross profit  and net income historically occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter 
this seasonal pattern reflects the increased demand for books and gifts experienced during the year end holiday selling season 
working capital requirements are generally highest during the third fiscal quarter and the early part of the fourth fiscal quarter due to the seasonality of the company s business 
the company s results of operations depend significantly upon net sales generated during the fourth fiscal quarter  and any significant adverse trend in the net sales of such period would likely have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations for the full year 
in addition  the company s results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the amount and timing of sales and profits contributed by new stores as well as other factors 
new stores require the company to incur pre opening expenses and often require several months of operation before generating acceptable sales volumes 
accordingly  the addition of a large number of new stores in a particular quarter could adversely affect the company s results of operations for that quarter
