the forward looking statements in this document are made as of the date on which they are made and we do not undertake to update our forward looking statements 
our future growth depends on a variety of factors  including our ability to increase vehicle sold volumes and loan transaction volumes  expand our product and service offerings including information systems development  acquire and integrate additional business entities  manage expansion  control costs in our operations  introduce fee increases  and retain our executive officers and key employees 

table of contents certain initiatives that management considers important to our long term success include projects involving substantial capital investment in e business  information technology  facility relocations and expansions  as well as operating initiatives designed to enhance overall efficiencies  all of which have significant risks associated with their execution  and could take several years to yield any direct monetary benefits 
accordingly  we cannot predict whether our growth strategy will be successful 
in addition  we cannot predict what portion of overall sales will be conducted through online auctions or other remarketing methods in the future and what impact this may have on our auction business 
overview we provide whole car and salvage auction services in north america 
our business is divided into three reportable business segments  each of which is an integral part of the vehicle remarketing industry adesa auctions  iaa and afc 
the adesa auctions segment serves an international customer base through online auctions and through whole car auction facilities in north america  that are developed and strategically located to draw professional sellers and buyers together and allow the buyers to inspect and compare vehicles remotely or in person 
online auctions include openlane  a leader in internet based remarketing solutions  and allow the company to offer vehicles for sale from any location 
vehicles at adesa s auctions are typically sold by commercial fleet operators  financial institutions  rental car companies  used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to franchised and independent used vehicle dealers 
adesa also provides value added ancillary services including inspections  storage  transportation  reconditioning and titling and other administrative services 
the iaa segment consisted of salvage vehicle auctions and related services provided at sites in north america at december  the salvage auctions facilitate the remarketing of damaged or low value vehicles designated as total losses by insurance companies and charity donation vehicles  as well as recovered stolen or theft vehicles 
the salvage auction business specializes in providing services such as transportation  titling  salvage recovery and claims settlement administrative services 
the afc segment provides short term  inventory secured financing  known as floorplan financing  primarily to independent used vehicle dealers 
at december   afc conducted business at locations in north america 
the holding company is maintained separately from the three reportable segments and includes expenses associated with the corporate office  such as salaries  benefits  and travel costs for our management team  certain human resources  information technology and accounting costs  and certain insurance  treasury  legal and risk management costs 
holding company interest expense includes the interest expense incurred on the corporate debt structure 
intercompany charges relate primarily to interest on intercompany debt or receivables and certain information technology costs allocated by the holding company 
industry outlook and trends whole car in and  the north american whole car auction industry experienced supply shortages as a result of the impacts felt by the automotive industry over the last three years  including volatility in new vehicle sales  lease originations and repossessions 
the supply shortages resulted in a decline in whole car auction volume compared to prior years 
used vehicles sold in north america through whole car auctions were million  million and an estimated million excluding approximately million used vehicles sold by openlane in in   and  respectively 
the supply 
table of contents shortages and resulting decline in industry auction volumes reflect a reduction in units sold by institutional consignors 
this reduction has been partially offset by an increase in dealer consignment units sold in and other reasons for the decline in industry volumes  which may also impact future volumes include a decline in new car sales from million in to million in although new car sales have climbed over the last two years to approximately million units in  they are not anticipated to return to levels for the foreseeable future 
the drop in total new vehicle sales in and  coupled with a tightening of consumer credit and changing policies regarding delinquent loans by the major lenders  resulted in a decline in repossessed vehicles coming to auction 
lease residuals are currently below wholesale vehicle values 
as a result  more vehicles are purchased upstream by the consumer and the grounding dealer or by dealers in online auctions  prior to the vehicles being transported to a physical auction 
more dealers are choosing to sell the trade ins they receive rather than remarket them through whole car auctions 
as used vehicle prices have increased over the last few years  dealers have shifted to sell more used vehicles  which can generate better margins than new car sales 
these dealers can also make money on the used units by providing future maintenance as well as finance and insurance services 
there was a reduction in the number of lease originations in and we believe this decline will continue to negatively impact the supply of off lease vehicles available at auction in and this trend could continue beyond based on the factors discussed above  we estimate that used vehicle auction volumes in north america  including units sold by openlane  will be approximately million units in  approach million units in and are expected to reach nearly million units by salvage vehicles deemed a total loss by automobile insurance companies represent the largest category of vehicles sold in the salvage vehicle auction industry 
as vehicles become increasingly more complex with additional enhancements  such as airbags and electrical components  they are more costly to repair following an accident and insurance companies are more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss 
the percentage of claims resulting in total losses is estimated at for  down slightly from there is no central reporting system that tracks the number of total loss vehicles in any given year which makes estimating industry volumes very difficult 
automotive finance in and  the overall economy and in particular the automotive finance industries faced pressures  which negatively affected the used vehicle dealer base 
more than  independent dealers went out of business during and  representing almost a reduction in the independent dealer base 
used vehicle dealers experienced a significant decline in sales which resulted in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans  which increased credit losses 
in addition  the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans was impacted to some degree by the volatility in the vehicle pricing market 
to the extent these negative trends recur  they could have a material adverse impact on afc s results of operations 
despite the negative factors and trends that impacted the automotive finance industry in and  afc s financial results have steadily improved since that time 
afc implemented a number of strategic initiatives in and early designed to tighten credit standards and reduce risk and 
table of contents exposure in its portfolio of finance receivables 
these initiatives have resulted in a substantial ongoing improvement in the aging of the managed portfolio  which was approximately percent current at december  in addition  afc s managed portfolio of finance receivables grew approximately percent from million at december  to million at december  seasonality the volume of vehicles sold at our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter 
this seasonality is caused by several factors including weather  the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers  the availability and quality of salvage vehicles  holidays  and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles  which affects the demand side of the auction industry 
used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions 
in addition  mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur  resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall 
as a result  revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis 
the fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather 
sources of revenues and expenses our revenue is derived from auction fees and related services at our whole car and salvage auctions  and from dealer financing fees and interest income at afc 
although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees  our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold 
prior to january   afc s net revenue consisted primarily of securitization income and interest and fee income less provisions for credit losses 
securitization income was primarily comprised of the gain on sale of finance receivables sold  but also included servicing income  discount accretion  and any change in the fair value of the retained interest in finance receivables sold 
accounting standards update amended asc  transfers and servicing  and we adopted the guidance on january  as a result of adopting the guidance  our consolidated statement of income no longer reflects securitization income  but instead reports interest and fee income  provision for credit losses and other income associated with our securitized finance receivables  in the same line items in our statement of income as non securitized receivables 
interest expense associated with the related obligation is now recorded below operating profit as interest expense in our consolidated statement of income 
additionally  we no longer record a gain on sale for securitization activity since finance receivables securitized no longer receive gain on sale treatment 
prior to  certain afc fees collected from customers were netted against cost of services  as well as certain selling  general and administrative expenses 
such fees included lot check fees  filing fees and postage fees  each of which are charged to and collected from afc s customers 
at december   these fees were included in revenue with the corresponding costs reflected in their respective expense categories  resulting in an increase to other revenue as well as an increase to the related expenses for prior periods presented 
our operating expenses consist of cost of services  selling  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs  subcontract services  supplies  insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices 
cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization 
selling  general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs  sales and marketing  information technology services and professional fees

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses at afc increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of increases in incentive compensation expense  salaries and related employee benefit costs  professional fees and stock based compensation expense 
holding company results year ended december  dollars in millions selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating loss selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses at the holding company decreased million  or  to million  compared with million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the termination of our financial advisory fees paid to the equity sponsors 
we paid the equity sponsors a total of million in  including million of termination fees in connection with the termination of our ongoing financial advisory fees with each of them 
selling  general and administrative expenses also decreased as a result of a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to the kar llc and axle llc operating units which are remeasured each reporting period to fair value 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in professional fees and other expenses 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that the significant indicators of liquidity for our business are cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital and amounts available under our credit facility 
our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash generated by operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents restricted cash working capital amounts available under credit facility cash flow from operations there were related outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which reduce the amount available for borrowings under the respective credit facilities 
working capital a substantial amount of our working capital is generated from the payments received for services provided 
the majority of our working capital needs are short term in nature  usually less than a week in duration 
due to the decentralized nature of the business  payments for most vehicles purchased are received at each auction and branch 
most of the financial institutions place a temporary hold on the availability of the funds deposited that generally can range up to two business days  resulting in cash in our accounts and on our balance sheet that is unavailable for use until it is made available by the various financial institutions 
there are outstanding checks book overdrafts to sellers and vendors included in current liabilities 
because a portion of these outstanding checks for operations in the us are drawn upon bank accounts at financial institutions other than the financial institutions that hold the cash  we cannot offset all the cash and the outstanding checks on our balance sheet 
our available cash  which excludes cash in transit  was million at december  of this amount  approximately million was held by foreign subsidiaries and considered to be permanently reinvested in our non us businesses 
if the funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were to be repatriated  tax expense would need to be accrued at the us statutory rate  net of any applicable foreign tax credits 
such foreign tax credits would substantially offset any us taxes that would be due in the event cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was repatriated 
afc offers short term inventory secured financing  also known as floorplan financing  to used vehicle dealers 
financing is primarily provided for terms of to days 
afc principally generates its funding through the sale of its receivables 
the receivables sold pursuant to the securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings

credit facilities on may   we established a new billion  six year senior secured term loan facility new term loan b and a new million  five year senior secured revolving credit facility  the terms of which are set forth in the credit agreement  dated as of may  the credit agreement 
concurrently with our entry into the credit agreement  we terminated our previous credit facility  dated as of april  as amended  the credit agreement 
on may   we paid all principal outstanding and interest due under the credit agreement 
no early termination penalties were incurred by the company in connection with the termination of the 
table of contents credit agreement  however  we incurred a non cash loss on the extinguishment of old term loan b of million representative of the write off of certain unamortized debt issuance costs 
in addition  we recognized million of additional interest expense to settle and terminate our million notional swap agreement  which was used to hedge interest payments on old term loan b 
the new credit facility is available for letters of credit  working capital and general corporate purposes including refinancing certain existing indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides that with respect to the new revolving credit facility  up to million is available for letters of credit and up to million is available for swing line loans 
the credit agreement also permits up to million of additional revolving or term loan commitments from one or more of the existing lenders or other lenders with the consent of the administrative agent 
new term loan b was issued at a discount of million 
the discount is being amortized to interest expense over the six year term of the loan 
new term loan b is payable in quarterly installments equal to of the original aggregate principal amount 
payments commenced on september   and the balance is payable at maturity 
the new credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and reduction in an amount equal to i the net proceeds of certain debt offerings  asset sales and certain insurance recovery events  and ii for any fiscal year ending on or after december   any excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement 
new term loan b will bear interest at an adjusted libor rate plus with an adjusted libor rate floor of per annum and revolving loan borrowings at an adjusted libor rate plus  however  for specified types of borrowings  the company may elect to make term loan borrowings at a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus and revolving loan borrowings at a base rate plus 
the rate on new term loan b was at december  in addition  if the company reduces its consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement  which is based on a net debt calculation  to levels specified in the credit agreement  the applicable interest rate will step down by basis points 
the company will also pay a commitment fee of basis points  payable quarterly  on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility 
the fee may step down to basis points based on the company s consolidated senior secured leverage ratio as described above 
on december    million was outstanding on new term loan b and million was drawn on the new revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings under the old revolving credit facility at december  however  there were related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million and million at december  and december   respectively  which reduce the amount available for borrowings under the respective credit facilities 
the company intends to repay the million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility within the next twelve months 
in addition  our canadian operations have a c million line of credit which was undrawn as of december  however  there were related letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately c million at december   which reduce credit available under the canadian line of credit  but do not affect amounts available for borrowings under our new revolving credit facility 
the obligations of the company under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries the subsidiary guarantors and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and the subsidiary guarantors  including but not limited to a pledges of and perfected first priority security interests in of the equity interests of certain of the company s and the subsidiary guarantors domestic subsidiaries and of the equity interests of certain of the company s and the subsidiary guarantors first tier foreign subsidiaries and b perfected first priority security interests in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the company and each subsidiary guarantor  subject to certain exceptions 

table of contents the credit agreement contains certain restrictive loan covenants  including  among others  a financial covenant requiring that a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio be satisfied as of the last day of each fiscal quarter if revolving loans are outstanding  and covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  make acquisitions  consummate change of control transactions  dispose of assets  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  make investments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
the leverage ratio covenant is based on consolidated adjusted ebitda which is ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted to exclude among other things a gains and losses from asset sales  b unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in respect of indebtedness  c certain non recurring gains and losses  d stock option expense  e certain other noncash amounts included in the determination of net income  f management  monitoring  consulting and advisory fees paid to the equity sponsors  g charges and revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting  h unrealized gains and losses on hedge agreements  i minority interest  j expenses associated with the consolidation of salvage operations  k consulting expenses incurred for cost reduction  operating restructuring and business improvement efforts  l expenses realized upon the termination of employees and the termination or cancellation of leases  software licenses or other contracts in connection with the operational restructuring and business improvement efforts  m expenses incurred in connection with permitted acquisitions  and n any impairment charges or write offs of intangibles 
certain covenants contained within the credit agreement are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial liquidity  as the failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could result in a default and allow our lenders to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable 
the maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio is required to be met when there are revolving loans outstanding under our credit agreement 
the maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio cannot exceed to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter through september  beginning with the quarter ending december   the ratio cannot exceed to and continues to decline throughout the remaining life of the credit facility until it reaches to at december  our maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio was to at december  in addition  the indenture governing our floating rate senior notes contains certain financial and operational restrictions that  similar to the credit agreement  limit our ability to pay dividends and other distributions  make certain acquisitions or investments  incur indebtedness  grant liens and sell assets 
the covenants in the credit agreement and the indenture governing our floating rate senior notes affect our operating flexibility by  among other things  restricting our ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could be used to grow the business  as well as to fund general corporate purposes 
we were in compliance with the covenants in the credit agreement and the indenture governing our floating rate senior notes at december  we believe our sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents on hand  working capital  cash provided by operating activities  and availability under our credit facility are sufficient to meet our short and long term operating needs for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe the previously mentioned sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements and debt service payments for the next twelve months 
securitization facilities afc sells the majority of its us dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  consolidated  special purpose subsidiary afc funding corporation  established for the purpose of purchasing afc s finance receivables 
a securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by afc funding corporation to a bank conduit facility of undivided interests in certain eligible finance receivables subject to committed liquidity 

table of contents on april   afc and afc funding corporation entered into the fourth amended and restated receivables purchase agreement the receivables purchase agreement 
the receivables purchase agreement increased afc funding s us committed liquidity from million to million and extended the facility s maturity date from april  to june  in addition  the interest costs for amounts borrowed increased approximately and certain of the covenants and termination events in the receivables purchase agreement that are tied to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio were modified 
on may   automotive finance canada  inc afci entered into an amended and restated receivables purchase agreement the canadian receivables purchase agreement 
the canadian receivables purchase agreement increased afci s canadian committed liquidity from c million to c million and extended the facility s maturity date from april  to june  afci s committed liquidity is provided through a third party conduit separate from the us conduit 
asu amended asc  transfers and servicing  and we adopted the guidance on january  the guidance specifies that the finance receivable transactions on or subsequent to january  under our revolving sale agreement be included in our balance sheet 
this resulted in an increase in assets and related obligations in in addition  the guidance eliminated securitization income accounting and resulted in the recording of fee and interest income and interest expense for the finance receivable transactions under the revolving sale agreement 
afc managed total finance receivables of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
afc s allowance for losses was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december  and december   million and million  respectively  of finance receivables and a cash reserve of percent of finance receivables securitized serve as security for the million and million of obligations collateralized by finance receivables at december  and december   respectively 
the amount of the cash reserve depends on circumstances which are set forth in the securitization agreements 
after the occurrence of a termination event  as defined in the us securitization agreement  the bank conduit facility may  and could  cause the stock of afc funding corporation to be transferred to the bank conduit facility  though as a practical matter the bank conduit facility would look to the liquidation of the receivables under the transaction documents as their primary remedy 
proceeds from the revolving sale of receivables to the bank conduit facility are used to fund new loans to customers 
afc  afc funding corporation and afci must maintain certain financial covenants including  among others  limits on the amount of debt afc and afci can incur  minimum levels of tangible net worth  and other covenants tied to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio 
the securitization agreements also incorporate the financial covenants of our credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants in the securitization agreements 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented herein  are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
they are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered substitutes for net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 

table of contents ebitda is defined as net income loss  plus interest expense net of interest income  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is ebitda adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings  as described above in the discussion of certain restrictive loan covenants under credit facilities 
management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors 
in addition  management uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate our performance and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under gaap 
these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

the change in operating assets was driven by the reduction in retained interests in finance receivables sold and a reduction in finance receivables held for sale in  which resulted from the adoption of asu net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the change in net cash used by investing activities was primarily the result of the net increase in finance receivables held for investment  which resulted from the adoption of asu the guidance specifies that the finance receivable transactions on or subsequent to january  under our revolving sale agreement be included in our balance sheet 
in addition  we spent million more on acquisitions and million more on capital items in compared with for a discussion of the company s capital expenditures  see capital expenditures below 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the change in net cash provided by financing activities was attributable to the million increase in obligations collateralized by finance receivables in  which resulted from the adoption of asu as discussed above  partially offset by payments on debt in  primarily with proceeds from our initial public offering 
in 
table of contents addition  the change in net cash provided by financing activities was impacted by the extinguishment of the old term loan b credit facility  as the proceeds from new term loan b  as well as cash on hand  were used to pay all principal outstanding and interest due under the credit agreement and to pay the principal and net premiums related to the repurchase of our fixed senior notes and our senior subordinated notes 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the years ended december  and approximated million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures were funded primarily from internally generated funds 
we continue to invest in our core information technology capabilities and capacity expansion 
capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million for fiscal year anticipated expenditures are primarily attributable to ongoing information system projects  integration of openlane and adesa information systems  upkeep and improvements at existing vehicle auction facilities  improvements in information technology systems and infrastructure and expansion and relocation of existing auction sites that are at capacity 
future capital expenditures could vary substantially based on capital project timing and the initiation of new information systems projects to support our business strategies 
acquisitions in august  adesa entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement with openlane  inc openlane 
in october  we completed the acquisition of openlane  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of adesa 
openlane is a north american online automotive auction company that provides a market for online buyers and sellers of wholesale vehicles 
openlane offers its comprehensive remarketing solutions to auto manufacturers  captive finance companies  lease and daily rental companies  used vehicle dealers  financial institutions and wholesale auto auctions throughout the united states and canada 
as a result of the merger and pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  each outstanding share of openlane common stock and preferred stock other than those shares of common stock or preferred stock held by openlane was converted into the right to receive an amount in cash as set forth in the merger agreement 
the value of the cash consideration payable in the merger was million plus approximately million for excess cash on openlane s balance sheet at the closing of the merger 
we funded the cash consideration paid at closing with a combination of approximately million of existing cash on hand and borrowings of approximately million from our revolving credit facility 
we utilized approximately million of acquired cash to immediately repay a portion of the borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we entered into operating lease obligations related to various facilities through initial annual lease payments for the various facilities are approximately million per year 
financial results for the acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  openlane contributed revenue of million and had a net loss of million  or per diluted share 
during  we completed the acquisitions of a company that auctions heavy machinery  a company that develops satellite based  gps technology for advanced vehicle tracking and a salvage facility 
the purchase agreements included contingent payments related to financial results and business deployments subsequent to the purchase date 
the purchased assets included fixed assets  software  inventory  accounts receivable and other intangible assets 
financial results for each acquisition have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the aggregate purchase price for the businesses acquired in  net of cash  was approximately million  which includes estimated contingent payments with a present value of million 
the 
table of contents maximum amount of undiscounted contingent payments related to these acquisitions could approximate million 
the purchase price for the acquired businesses was allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based upon fair values  including million to intangible assets  representing the fair value of acquired customer relationships  tradenames  software and noncompete agreements  which are being amortized over their expected useful lives 
the acquisitions resulted in aggregate goodwill of million 
the financial impact of these acquisitions  including pro forma financial results  was immaterial to the company s statement of operations 
some of our acquisitions from prior years include contingent payments related to revenues or unit volumes of certain vehicles sold subsequent to the purchase dates 
we made contingent payments in  and totaling approximately million  million and million  respectively  pursuant to these agreements  which resulted in additional goodwill 
in addition  in  we reversed contingent consideration of approximately million related to certain prior year acquisitions based on revised forecasts which indicated the unit volumes required during the measurement period in order for the contingent consideration to become payable would not be met 
the net million of contingent consideration adjustments were recorded to other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of income 
contractual obligations the table below sets forth a summary of our contractual debt and operating lease obligations as of december  some of the figures included in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we may actually pay in future periods could vary from those reflected in the table 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt new million revolving credit facility a new term loan b a floating rate senior notes due a capital lease obligations b interest payments relating to long term debt c postretirement benefit payments d operating leases e total contractual cash obligations a the table assumes the long term debt is held to maturity

iaa assumed the obligation in connection with the acquisition of the capital stock of usc in 
table of contents e operating leases are entered into in the normal course of business 
we lease some of our auction facilities  as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
some lease agreements contain options to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
future operating lease obligations would change if the renewal options were exercised and or if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex 
consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounting measurements that management believes are most critical to the reported results of our operations and financial condition include uncollectible receivables and allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts  goodwill and long lived assets  self insurance programs  legal proceedings and other loss contingencies and income taxes 
in addition to the critical accounting estimates  there are other items used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in cases where management estimates are used  they are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
in addition  our most significant accounting policies are discussed in note and elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are included in this annual report on form k 
uncollectible receivables and allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowances for credit losses and doubtful accounts are based on management s evaluation of the receivables portfolio under current economic conditions  the volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio credit quality  review of specific collection matters and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve recognition in estimating losses 
specific collection matters can be impacted by the outcome of negotiations  litigation and bankruptcy proceedings 
due to the nature of our business  substantially all trade receivables are due from vehicle dealers  salvage buyers  institutional customers and insurance companies 
we generally have possession of vehicles or vehicle titles collateralizing a significant portion of these receivables 
at the auction sites  risk is mitigated through a pre auction registration process that includes verification of identification  bank accounts  dealer license status  acceptable credit history  buying history at other auctions and the written acceptance of all of the auction s policies and procedures 
afc s allowance for credit losses includes an estimate of losses for finance receivables 
afc controls credit risk through credit approvals  credit limits  underwriting and collateral management monitoring procedures  which includes holding vehicle titles where permitted 
goodwill and long lived assets when we acquire businesses  the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the 
table of contents allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may be impaired 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and our market valuation relative to our book value 
in assessing goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and earnings  changes in our business strategy and economic conditions affecting market valuations related to the fair values of our three reporting units which consist of our three operating and reportable business segments adesa auctions  iaa and afc 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and we must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with asc  business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
we review long lived assets for possible impairment whenever circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if it is determined that the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the total amount of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from that asset  we would recognize a loss to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management judgment is involved in both deciding if testing for recovery is necessary and in estimating undiscounted cash flows 
our impairment analysis is based on the current business strategy  expected growth rates and estimated future economic conditions 
self insurance programs we self insure a portion of employee medical benefits under the terms of our employee health insurance program  as well as a portion of our automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
we have insurance coverage that limits the exposure on individual claims 
we also have insurance coverage that limits the total exposure to overall automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims 
the cost of the insurance is expensed over the contract periods 

table of contents we record an accrual for the claims expense related to our employee medical benefits  automobile  general liability and workers compensation claims based upon the expected amount of all such claims 
trends in healthcare costs could have a significant impact on anticipated claims 
if actual claims are higher than anticipated  our accrual might be insufficient to cover the claims costs  which would have an adverse impact on the operating results in that period 
legal proceedings and other loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various legal proceedings and other loss contingencies  many involving litigation incidental to the business and a variety of environmental laws and regulations 
litigation and other loss contingencies are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes of such matters are often very difficult to predict and generally are resolved over long periods of time 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
estimating probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often are dependent on the judgment about potential actions by third parties 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or otherwise disclosed  in accordance with asc  contingencies 
we accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted 
if the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued  this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period 
legal fees are expensed as incurred 
income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we will undergo scheduled reviews by taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
tax reviews often require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
we record our tax provision based on existing laws  experience with previous settlement agreements  the status of current irs or other taxing authority examinations and management s understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
we establish reserves when we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged by a taxing authority 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances 
new accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a 
table of contents reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
the new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   however  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income  either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu  to defer the effective date of the specific requirement to present items that are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income 
all other provisions of asu are effective for the first annual reporting period  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and should be applied retrospectively 
we do not expect the adoption of asu will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our foreign currency exposure is limited and arises from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  particularly intercompany loans  as well as from translation of the results of operations from our canadian and  to a much lesser extent  mexican subsidiaries 
however  fluctuations between us and us currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non us subsidiaries 
to the extent such repatriation is necessary for us to meet our debt service or other obligations  these tax inefficiencies may adversely affect us 
we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge changes in the canadian or mexican exchange rates 
canadian currency translation positively affected net income by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
currency exposure of our mexican operations is not material to the results of operations 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings 
accordingly  interest rate fluctuations affect the amount of interest expense we are obligated to pay 
we use interest rate derivative agreements to manage the variability of cash flows to be paid due to interest rate movements on our variable rate debt 
we have designated our interest rate derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the earnings impact of the derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded upon the recognition of the interest related to the hedged debt 
any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationships is recognized in current earnings 
there was no significant ineffectiveness in the years ended december  or in august  we purchased three interest rate caps for an aggregate amount of approximately million with an aggregate notional amount of million to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate new term loan b credit facility when one month libor exceeds 
the interest rate cap agreements each had an effective date of august  and each mature on august  in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to manage our exposure to interest rate movements on our variable rate old term loan b credit facility 
the interest rate swap agreement had an effective date of june   was scheduled to mature on june  and effectively resulted in a fixed libor interest rate of on million of the old term loan b credit facility 
in connection with the extinguishment of old term loan b in may  we de designated our interest rate swap and entered into a swap termination agreement 
we paid million to settle and terminate the swap agreement 
the fair values of the interest rate derivatives are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments from commercial banks 
as noted above  our interest rate swap agreement was terminated in may  and our old interest rate cap agreement matured on june  at december   the aggregate fair value of the three interest rate caps was a million asset recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap was a million unrealized loss recorded in other accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet  and the fair value of the old interest rate cap was a less than million asset recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
unrealized gains or losses on the interest rate derivatives are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   there was a net unrealized gain totaling million  net of tax benefits of less than million 
we were exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties  however  non performance is not anticipated 
we only partially hedged our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our old variable rate debt 
a sensitivity analysis of the impact on our variable rate debt instruments to a hypothetical basis point increase in short term rates for the year ended december  would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately million
