item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in item a 
risk factors 
overview we are engaged in the research  development  manufacture  and distribution of botanical products  bio pharmaceutical products  and traditional chinese medicines  or tcm  in the people s republic of china 
we have three gmp certified production facilities ah city natural and biopharmaceutical plant  dongfanghong pharmaceutical plant and qingyang natural extraction plant capable of producing dosage forms and over different products 
our products include but are not limited to i botanical anti depression and nerve regulation products  ii biopharmaceutical products  and iii botanical antibiotic and traditional otc chinese medicines 
botanical anti depression and nerve regulation products account for approximate of our revenues and we continue to strengthen our development in this area 
we have entered into sales agency agreements with our sales agents through them our products are sold to over  distributors and over sales centers across provinces in china 
factors affecting our results of operations our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors pharmaceutical industry growth 
we believe the market for pharmaceutical products in china is growing rapidly driven by china s economic growth  increased pharmaceutical expenditure  an aging population  increased lifestyle related diseases  government support of the pharmaceutical industry  as well as the increased availability of funding for medical insurance in china 
in particular  in january  the prc s state council passed a far reaching medical reform plan health reform to help provide universal primary medical insurance coverage and increased access to medical facilities to a greater majority of its citizens 
both the central government of china and provincial governments has published lists of essential medicines to regulate the market 
we expect these factors to continue to drive industry growth 
pricing of our products 
seven of our products  which accounted for of our total revenues in fiscal year  are listed on the national or provincial list of essential medicines published by the chinese government  and therefore subject to government pricing limits 
we do not believe pricing controls will influence our sales significantly and expect that the health care reform will help increase our sales 
production capacity 
we believe much of the pharmaceutical market in china is still underserved  particularly with respect to treatment of depression  melancholy and nerve regulation 
the demand for our products that treat depression  melancholy and regulate nerves  continuously increased and we were able to increase our production of such products to capture much of this growth 
we believe our current facilities with the ability to manufacture dosage forms and over products could not meet our future demand and we are building our ah city phase two project  depth development and industrialization of siberian ginseng  to produce more advanced siberian ginseng products and to allow us to capture future market growth and increase our revenue and market share accordingly 
perceptions of product quality 
we believe that rising health concerns in china have contributed to a greater demand for health care products with perceived health benefits 
we believe many consumers in china tend to prefer natural health care products with  we believe  limited side effects 
accordingly  we believe our reputation for quality and leadership position in a number of our products allow our products to command a higher average selling price and generate higher gross margins than our competitors 
raw material supply and prices 
the per unit costs of producing our products are subject to the supply and price volatility of raw materials  which are affected by various market factors such as market demands  fluctuations in production and competition 
expenses associated with research and development 
in order to enhance our existing products and develop new products for the market  we have devoted significant resources to r d 
expenses associated with sales and marketing 
in order to promote our product brand and gain greater market awareness  we have devoted significant resources to sales and marketing  in particular advertising activities 
demand for our products 
we expect the market demand for our botanic anti depression and nerve regulation products will increase along with the growth of the general market for such products 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding our results of operation 
for the year ended october  in thousands statements of operations data sales  net   cost of goods sold   gross profit   operating and administrative expenses sales and marketing   general and administrative   research and development   total operating expenses   income from operations   other income income before income tax expenses   income tax expenses  net income   other comprehensive income cumulative currency translation adjustments   total comprehensive income   comparison of years ended october  and total comprehensive income total comprehensive income increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million  or  in net sales  and an increase of approximately million  or  in cost of goods sold and an increase of approximately million  or  in sales and marketing expenses  an increase of approximately million  or  in general and administration expenses  an increase of approximately million  or  in research and development expenses  and an increase of million in cumulative currency translation adjustments 
our gross profit margin increased from in to in sales our sales consist primarily of revenues generated from sales of botanical anti depression and nerve regulation products  biopharmaceutical products and botanical antibiotics and traditional otc chinese medicines 
sales increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase in sales was primarily attributable to the launching of our new products and strong market acceptance of our siberian ginseng series products as a result of our marketing efforts  in addition to the price increase of our overall products 
we provide incentive sales rebates to our sales agents 
the rebate rate  which is based on a product basis  averaged of and of total sales for the year ended october  and  respectively 
sales rebates are netted against total sales 
the following table sets forth information regarding the net sales of our principal products before sales rebate during the fiscal years ended october  and over quantity amount of quantity amount of quantity amount of product name pack sales pack sales pack sales siberian ginseng acanthopanax series  tianma series   compound yangjiao tablets  shark vital capsules  shengmai granules   banlangen granules   compound honeysuckle granules   qingrejiedu oral liquid  compound schizandra tablets  ginseng and venison extract  badger oil  total   while we had increased sales  we experienced a decrease in the sales of a number of our products mainly from the following few reasons 
first  we increased the overall selling prices of our products range from to on january  the market normally needs six months or even longer to absorb the impact of price increase 
second  as the prc government moves forward with the healthcare reform  we experienced demanding fluctuation and this situation will continue until the healthcare reform fully in place and the national healthcare system mature 
third  we increased the capacity per package for some of our products  such as siberian ginseng tablets  the tablets per bottle increased from to tablets per bottle 
fourth  we focused our effort to our main products  siberian ginseng series  ginseng and venison extract  badger oil and compound schizandra tablets which accounted for of our total sales and have higher gross margin and we have dominated the market of these four products and will continue to put more effort to strengthen our market share 
the prc government is injecting funds into healthcare insurance system to reimburse full or part of the medical expenses consumed by chinese citizen 
we expect the healthcare reform  when fully in place  will greatly improve the affordability of healthcare cost of chinese people and therefore increase the demand for our products 
we have established medical reform sales department as a dedicated resource focused on capturing this tremendous growth opportunity 
in the third quarter of our fiscal year  we introduced two new products to the market  qing re jie du oral liquid  which is used to cure seasonal flu  and compound schisandra tablets  also known as magnolia vine  has been clinically proven to have significant benefits to the functioning and regulation of the central nervous system 
in the last quarter of our fiscal year  we introduced ginseng and venison extract product to the market which nourishes the blood and kidney  restores the body s energy and increase endurance and has been in great demand since we launched the product 
in the first quarter of our fiscal year  we introduced badger oil which treats burns and scalds and attracted great attention from many patients 
on january   we increased the average sales price per pack of our products  as demonstrated in the table below sales revenues before sales rebate in thousands  total sales quantity pack in thousands average selling prices pack in thousands the increase in average sales price per pack  as reflected in the table  is primarily attributable to the increase in the sales price of individual products  namely siberian ginseng acanthopanax series  tianma series  banlangen granules and ginseng and venison extract as demonstrated in the following table  which reflects the average sales price per pack by product for and and the percentage changes in the sales price per pack 
average price per pack percentage product change siberian ginseng acanthopanax series tianma series compound yangjiao tablets shark vital capsules shengmai granules banlangen granules compound honeysuckle granules compound schizandra tablets ginseng and venison extract qing re jie du oral liquid badger oil total we expect the demand for our products will increase as we continue to garner greater market acceptance  in particular the benefits of our siberian ginseng acanthopanax series in treating depression and nerve regulation 
further  we see signs of increased demand from our newly launched product  ginseng and venison extract which accounted for over of our total sales revenue in fiscal year we believe that we will have a continuous and stable sales increase in these products for fiscal year in addition  we anticipate that we will be successful in becoming one of china s essential medicine suppliers as the prc government moves forward with its health reforms in cost of goods sold our costs of goods sold consist primarily of direct and indirect manufacturing costs  including raw material  packaging material  labor cost  utilities and depreciation 
cost of goods sold increased approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to increase in products sold and increases in certain raw material prices such as sugar and siberian ginseng raw material 
although we anticipate that the cost of goods will increase due to inflationary price increases  we do not believe that such increases will be material for fiscal year we anticipate that beyond  our price for raw materials and other production costs will continue to increase due to inflation 
if our costs of goods increase  this may have a negative effect on our net income because due to market conditions and competitive conditions  we may not be able to increase the price for our products in proportion to the increase in costs of goods sold 
operating and administrative expenses our total operating expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
our total operating expenses increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and market promotion expenses  and other overhead expenses incurred by the company s sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million  or  in advertising expenses as the company intensified tv advertisements in heilongjiang province for our botanic anti depression series 
sales and marketing expenses are likely to increase as we continue expanding our distribution network throughout china and seek to increase our market share and awareness of our products 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary  travel  entertainment expenses  rental  benefits  share based compensation  and professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million in rental expenses  an increase of approximately million in amortization expenses and an increase of million in salary expenses 
general and administrative expenses are likely to increase as we continue to expand our production  sourcing capacity  and distribution capacity throughout china 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salary  equipment rental expenses  and siberian ginseng acanthopanax cultivation related expenses 
research and development expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for to approximately million for this increase was primarily attributable to development of siberian ginseng acanthopanax cultivation and extraction of effective components of the siberian ginseng acanthopanax plant  and development of other products  and research in cultivation techniques for siberian ginseng 
research and development expenses are likely to increase as we continue to devote our resources to development of new products and enhancement of our existing products 
income from operations as a result of the foregoing  our income from operations increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in our fiscal year to approximately million in our fiscal year income tax expenses we are subject to us federal and state income taxes 
our subsidiary registered in the prc is subject to enterprise income taxes in china 
for the calendar years of and  our prc subsidiary was granted a tax reduction of and  respectively  with income tax payable of and  respectively 
our income tax expenses increased from for fiscal year to approximately million for fiscal year cumulative currency translation adjustments our principal country of operations is the prc and our functional currency is the renminbi  but our reporting currency is the us dollar 
all translation adjustments resulting from the translation of our financial statements into us dollars are reported as cumulative currency translation adjustments 
our cumulative currency translation adjustments increased by approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in liquidity and capital resources we had retained earnings of approximately million and million as of october  and  respectively 
as of october   we had cash of approximately million and total current assets of approximately million 
as of october   we had a working capital surplus of approximately million 
with the anticipated income from  we believe our cash are adequate to satisfy our working capital needs and sustain our ongoing operations for the next twelve months 
our summary cash flow information is as follows year ended october net cash provided by used in in thousands operating activities   investing activities   net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately million  from net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in to net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in net income of approximately million  an increase in the trade receivables of approximately million as a result of increased sales  an increase in inventories of approximately million  an increase in other receivables of approximately million and an increase in tax payable of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in payments made to purchase land use right  exclusive using right of undergrowth resources  prepayment of five patents and construction in progress 
net cash provided by financing activities we did not have any financing activities during fiscal years ended october  and outstanding long term indebtedness none expansion strategy we believe the market for pharmaceutical products in china is growing rapidly 
our growth strategy involves capturing as much of this market as possible during this rapid growth phase 
to implement this strategy we plan to strengthen our dominant position in the siberian ginseng acanthopanax market  expand our siberian ginseng acanthopanax cultivating bases and improving the quality standards of siberian ginseng acanthopanax  and extend our distribution network through internal distribution channels reforms 
our expansion strategy will require the continued retention and investment of our earnings from operations and  we believe  additional funding from private debt and equity financing 
in general  the commitment of funds to research and development  or acquisition or construction of plant and equipment tends to impair liquidity 
however  we believe that because of the upward trend in our revenues in recent years  even if this trend levels off  our income from continuing operations coupled with such additional financing  if required  should provide sufficient liquidity to meet our expansion needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

new accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu receivables topic a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring 
this asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings 
it is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of troubled debt restructurings 
for public companies  this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
early application is permitted 
it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and international accounting standards board iasb to develop a single  converged fair value framework that is  converged guidance on how not when to measure fair value and on what disclosures to provide about fair value measurements 
thus  there are few differences between this asu and its international counterpart  ifrs while this asu is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap  it expands topic s existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
many of these amendments were made to eliminate unnecessary wording differences between us gaap and ifrss 
however  some could change how the fair value measurement guidance in topic is applied 
this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  for public entities 
it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
this asu removes the presentation options in topic and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
this asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
this asu does not require incremental disclosures in addition to those required by topic or any transition guidance 
because the company is currently adopted to present comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of changes of equity and therefore  it is expected this asu would change the presentation of comprehensive income in the company s consolidated financial statements upon its adoption 
it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update will enhance disclosures required by us gaap by requiring improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset in accordance with either section or section or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement  irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either section or section this information will enable users of an entity s financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments in the scope of this update 
an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
it is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic in order to defer only those changes in update that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments  the paragraphs in this update supersede certain pending paragraphs in update the amendments are being made to allow the board time to redeliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
while the board is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before update all other requirements in update are not affected by this update  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  nonpublic entities should begin applying these requirements for fiscal years ending after december   and interim and annual periods thereafter
