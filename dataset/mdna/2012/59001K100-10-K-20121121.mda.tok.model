overview meritor  inc the company or meritor  headquartered in troy  michigan  is a premier global supplier of a broad range of integrated systems  modules and components to original equipment manufacturers oems and the aftermarket for the commercial vehicle  transportation and industrial sectors

our sales for fiscal year were  million  down compared to  million in the prior year 
we experienced a slowdown in sales volumes in all regions in which we operate compared to prior year volumes  other than in north america where the market remained strong 
income from continuing operations in fiscal year was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
net income for the year ended september  was million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in net income is primarily due to lower sales  higher restructuring costs  charges related to remeasurement of asbestos related liabilities and lower earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures in south america  which were partially offset by improved gross margins  a gain associated with the sale of excess land at our facility in cwmbran  wales and a lower effective tax rate 
adjusted ebitda see non gaap financial measures below for the fiscal year ended september  was million compared to million in fiscal year our adjusted ebitda margin in fiscal year was percent compared to percent in the same period a year ago 
the improvement in adjusted ebitda margin is due to key initiatives executed by the company during fiscal year including improved pricing and the sale of our st 
priest  france manufacturing facility  partially offset by lower sales 
on january   we completed the sale of our commercial truck manufacturing facility located in st 
priest  france to renault trucks sas  an affiliate of ab volvo 
this transaction did not have a significant impact on our sales as production was absorbed by our remaining manufacturing facilities in europe 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recognized non cash charges of million  including an asset impairment charge of million for the disposal group  in connection with the then anticipated sale 
in addition  other restructuring charges of approximately million associated with employee headcount reduction and plant rationalization costs were recorded during fiscal year during the second quarter of fiscal year  we launched a european headcount reduction plan in response to the ongoing economic weakness and uncertainty in that region 
we recognized approximately million of restructuring charges associated with this plan  which was substantially complete at september  in addition  in november  we announced a headcount reduction plan intended to reduce variable labor and other costs in response to market conditions in certain regions 
upon completion of this plan  we expect to eliminate approximately hourly and salaried positions 
we recognized approximately million of restructuring charges associated with this action during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we also announced in november the consolidation of remanufacturing operations in our aftermarket and trailer segment resulting in the closure of one remanufacturing plant in canada 
restructuring costs associated with these actions are expected to be approximately million 
on november   we announced a revised management reporting structure resulting in two business segments commercial truck industrial  and aftermarket trailer 
we will evaluate the impact of this revised reporting structure on our segment financial reporting in the first quarter of fiscal year cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal year is due to improvements in working capital and lower usage of cash from discontinued operations compared to the prior year  which were partially offset by higher pension contributions 
trends and uncertainties production volumes the following table reflects estimated commercial truck production volumes for selected original equipment oe markets based on available sources and management s estimates 
year ended september  estimated commercial truck production in thousands north america  heavy duty trucks north america  medium duty trucks western europe  heavy and medium duty trucks south america  heavy and medium duty trucks we expect production volumes in north america and europe to soften compared to the levels experienced in fiscal year beginning in second quarter of fiscal year  production volumes in south america declined significantly as the industry transitioned to tighter emission standard requirements for commercial vehicles 
the recovery of production volumes has been slower than previously expected and we expect production volumes in south america to remain at such low levels during the first half of fiscal year  with a modest improvement in the second half of fiscal year production volumes in the asia pacific region  more specifically china and india  have decreased compared to levels experienced in fiscal year  and there is no certainty as to when these volumes will return to the levels previously experienced 
sales for our primary military program were at their peak during the fourth quarter of fiscal year this program is expected to wind down over the next two years beginning in fiscal year we are working to secure our participation in new military programs with various oems 
however  failure to secure new military contracts could have a longer term negative impact to the company 
in addition  even if sales of our military programs do return to historic levels  the levels of profitability on these sales could be lower than what we have recognized in recent periods 
industry wide issues our business continues to address a number of other challenging industry wide issues including the following uncertainty around the global market outlook  volatility in price and availability of steel  components and other commodities  disruptions in the financial markets and their impact on the availability and cost of credit  higher energy and transportation costs  impact of currency exchange rate volatility  consolidation and globalization of oems and their suppliers  and significant pension and retiree medical health care costs 
other other significant factors that could affect our results and liquidity in fiscal year include significant contract awards or losses of existing contracts or failure to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations  ability to manage possible adverse effects on our european operations  or financing arrangements related thereto  in the event one or more countries exit the european monetary union  ability to work with our customers to manage rapidly changing production volumes  ability to recover and timing of recovery of steel price and other cost increases from our customers  any unplanned extended shutdowns or production interruptions by us  our customers or our suppliers  a significant deterioration or slowdown in economic activity in the key markets in which we operate  higher than planned price reductions to our customers  potential price increases from our suppliers  additional restructuring actions and the timing and recognition of restructuring charges  higher than planned warranty expenses  including the outcome of known or potential recall campaigns  our ability to implement planned productivity  cost reduction  and other margin improvement initiatives  and restrictive government actions by foreign countries such as restrictions on transfer of funds and trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs 
non gaap financial measures in addition to the results reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we have provided information regarding non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures include adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  free cash flow and free cash flow from continuing operations before restructuring payments 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations are defined as reported income or loss from continuing operations and reported diluted earnings or loss per share from continuing operations before restructuring expenses  asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management 
adjusted ebitda is defined as income loss from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non controlling interests in consolidated joint ventures  loss on sale of receivables  restructuring expenses  asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management 
adjusted ebitda margin is defined as adjusted ebitda divided by consolidated sales 
free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted income loss from continuing operations are meaningful measures of performance as they are commonly utilized by management and investors to analyze ongoing operating performance and entity valuation 
management  the investment community and banking institutions routinely use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  together with other measures  to measure operating performance in our industry 
further  management uses adjusted ebitda for planning and forecasting future periods 
in addition  we use segment ebitda as the primary basis to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable segments 
management believes that free cash flow is useful in analyzing our ability to service and repay debt 
adjusted income loss from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for the reported results prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
free cash flow should not be considered a substitute for cash provided by used for operating activities  or other cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of financial position or liquidity 
in addition  these non gaap cash flow measures do not reflect cash used to service debt or cash received from the divestitures of businesses or sales of other assets and thus do not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses 
these non gaap financial measures  as determined and presented by the company  may not be comparable to related or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
set forth below are reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap

in south america  the industry transitioned to tighter emission standard requirements for commercial vehicles resulting in lower production volumes beginning in our second quarter of fiscal year the recovery of production volumes in south america has been slower than previously expected  and we expect these production volumes to be lower in the first half of fiscal year compared to the first half of fiscal year industrial sales were  million in fiscal year  down from  million in fiscal year the decrease in sales was due to lower sales in the asia pacific region  primarily china and india  and lower sales from caiman and other non fmtv defense programs as compared to the same period in the prior year  partially offset by higher sales in our fmtv defense program
