item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results and the timing of selected events discussed below could differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of drugs targeting the microenvironment of solid tumors and the bone marrows of some hematologic malignancies blood cancers as novel treatments for patients living with cancer 
the microenvironment of these tissues is characterized by  among other things  hypoxia or lack of oxygen 
this hypoxic environment is known to be resistant to standard chemotherapy and radiation 
it is thought to be responsible for the poor prognosis of patients with solid tumors and hematological malignancies and treating the hypoxic environment is currently believed to be a significant unmet medical need 
our hypoxia activated prodrug hap product candidates  including th  are designed to specifically target the hypoxic microenvironment of tumors by selective activation of the prodrug to release a potent cytotoxin 
our focus is on product candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer 
our clinical development efforts are currently focused on th  for which we entered a license and co development agreement with merck kgaa for worldwide development and commercialization 
th  which we discovered  is a novel drug candidate that is activated under severe hypoxic conditions and was designed to specifically target the severe hypoxic regions that are believed to be present in all solid tumors and hematologic malignancies 
th is currently in phase  phase and phase clinical trials 
the development plan for th is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety across a broad range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies 
we reported updated top line results from the initial phase monotherapy trial of th trial including indication specific data in patients with metastatic melanoma and small cell lung cancer sclc 
we have also reported results from each of four phase combination therapy investigations of a chemotherapy agent plus th in solid tumors involving combining th with doxorubicin  gemcitabine  docetaxel and pemetrexed 
we have also reported results from our clinical study of th in patients with advanced leukemias trial and initiated a clinical study of th in patients with multiple myeloma trial 
in addition  investigations have been initiated to explore the combination of th with anti angiogenic therapies including a phase dose escalation clinical trial of th in combination with sunitinib sutent in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors trial and physician initiated clinical trial of th administered either in combination with bevacizumab avastin in patients with recurrent high grade astrocytoma including glioblastoma or in combination with pazopanib votrient in patients with solid tumors 
in january  we reported updated top line results from our phase combination clinical trial in patients with first line pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine plus th trial 
in june of we initiated a randomized  controlled phase b trial of th in combination with gemcitabine in patients with first line pancreatic cancer trial 
the study completed enrollment in june of in february of we reported top line results from this randomized phase b trial 
the median progression free survival pfs was months for patients treated with gemcitabine in combination with th at mg m and mg m compared to months for patients treated with gemcitabine alone 
the pfs hazard ratio comparing the th combination to gemcitabine alone was confidence interval which was highly statistically significant p and represented a improvement in pfs 
the response rate in the combination arms was compared to in the gemcitabine alone group 
results also demonstrated greater efficacy in the higher th dose group compared to the lower dose group 
the combination was well tolerated with a safety profile 
table of contents that was consistent with our prior study of this combination regimen 
as in that study  skin and mucosal toxicities related to th were dose dependent but not dose limiting 
we expect to provide detailed results from this trial in second quarter of as well as updated top line results  including overall survival in the second half of during  we presented updated top line results from our phase combination therapy in patients with soft tissue sarcoma treated with doxorubicin plus th at the maximum tolerated dose of mg m trial 
in february  we reached agreement with the fda on the design and planned analysis of a pivotal phase trial in patients with soft tissue sarcoma trial 
as part of the special protocol assessment spa submission  the fda agreed that the design and planned analysis of the proposed phase trial adequately addresses the objectives necessary to support a regulatory submission 
we initiated the pivotal phase trial in september of and expect to provide an update on the interim analysis which will be conducted by an independent data monitoring committee idmc in the beginning of we are working to broaden the applicability of th to other cancers and in combination with other approved anti cancer drugs as well as to discover additional hypoxia activated prodrugs that will selectively target cancer cells 
we are a development stage company incorporated in october we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates  and prior to our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations through the private placement of equity securities 
in february  we completed our initial public offering that raised net proceeds of million  and in october  we completed an offering of common stock that raised net proceeds of million 
in august  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of million 
in march  we completed an offering of common stock and warrants that raised net proceeds of approximately million  which includes underwriter discounts and offering costs 
during the year ended december  we raised net proceeds of million through the sale of common stock pursuant to our at the market stock issuance facility 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million and our cumulative net loss since our inception through december  was million 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we complete our current clinical trials  start additional clinical trials and continue our discovery efforts 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in compared to due to the continued execution of existing clinical trials and beginning of new clinical trials 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months based upon current operating plans  milestone payment forecasts and spending assumptions 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to in license or otherwise acquire and develop additional products or programs 
we intend to seek funds through additional arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
research and development expenses may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of the progress and results of our clinical trials 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates since our inception and do not expect to generate any revenue from the commercial sales of our product candidates in the near term 
in  we recognized million in revenue in connection with our agreement with eleison pharmaceuticals eleison for the development of glufosfamide  which represents our share of an upfront payment from a sublicense by eleison 

table of contents from to  we recognized million in revenue related to the upfront payment received in connection with a agreement with medibic for the development of glufosfamide in japan and several other asian countries 
the payment was contingent upon the finalization of the clinical development plan  which occurred in july revenue has been recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  through december  in  the company had no further responsibilities for development activities under this agreement and in may  the company dissolved the joint development committee jdc comprising medibic and us 
no payments were made by either party as a result of the dissolution of the jdc 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of costs of conducting clinical trials  salaries and related costs for personnel including non cash stock based compensation  costs of clinical materials  costs for research projects and preclinical studies  costs related to regulatory filings  and facility costs 
contracting and consulting expenses are a significant component of our research and development expenses as we rely on consultants and contractors in many of these areas 
we recognize expenses as they are incurred 
our accruals for expenses associated with preclinical and clinical studies and contracts associated with clinical materials are based upon the terms of the service contracts  the amount of services provided and the status of the activities 
we expect annual research and development expenses will increase in the future as we progress with larger clinical trials 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on research and development expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in the executive  finance  patent  accounting and other administrative functions  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as consulting costs for functions for which we either do not staff or only partially staff  including public relations  market research and recruiting 
other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services  insurance and facility costs 
from inception through december   we incurred an aggregate of million on general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value provisions of accounting standard codification asc  compensation stock compensation  using the modified prospective transition method  except for options granted prior to our initial public offering in february  for which the fair value was determined for disclosure purposes using the minimum value method 
refer to the discussion of accounting treatment of stock based compensation below under critical accounting policies 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue related to our agreement with eleison for the development of glufosfamide  which represents our share of an upfront payment from a sublicense by eleison 
for the year ended december   no revenue was recognized 
we expect revenue to increase in compared to due to  in february  our entering into a global license and co development agreement with merck kgaa  of darmstadt  germany  to co develop and commercialize th  our small molecule hypoxia targeted drug 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in expenses is due to a million increase in clinical and development expenses  million in higher staffing expenses and million in higher consulting expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in facilities expenses

due to our exclusive licensing development and commercialization of glufosfamide to eleison pharmaceutical  inc in october  we did not incur significant research and development expenses associated with glufosfamide since then 
we incurred no significant expenses related to dg since as we are not currently planning or conducting further additional clinical trials of dg

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred net losses of million since inception through december  we have not generated and do not expect to generate revenue from sales of product candidates in the near term 
from inception until our initial public offering in february  we funded our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  raising net proceeds of million 
in october  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
on august   we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock raising net proceeds of million 
on october   we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million 
during the year ended december  we sold  shares of our common stock at an average price of pursuant to our at the market stock issuance facility  for net proceeds of million 
in march  we sold to certain investors an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for a purchase price equal to per share and  for a purchase price equal to per share  warrants exercisable for a total of  shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds equal to million in connection with the offering 
the warrants have an exercise price equal to per share 
net proceeds generated from the offering were approximately million  which includes underwriter discounts and offering costs

net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   due to proceeds from the sale of stock under our equity incentive plans  partially offset by deferred offering costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   reflecting the million net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in october  offset by repayments of notes payable totaling for the year 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months based upon current operating plans  milestone payment forecasts and spending assumptions 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to in license or otherwise acquire and develop additional products or programs 
we intend to seek funds through additional arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity market  private equity financing  collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements  and or public or private debt 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on the outcome of our clinical trials and other clinical and regulatory events as well as factors related to financial  economic  and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through additional arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  any of which could delay or require that we curtail our development programs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our ability to raise additional capital may be dependent upon our stock being quoted on the nasdaq capital market 
if we are unable to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our activities  and if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there is uncertainty regarding our continued existence 
obligations and commitments we lease certain of our facilities under noncancelable leases  which qualify for operating lease accounting treatment under asc  leases  and  as such  these facilities are not included on our consolidated balance sheets 
in july  we entered into a noncancelable facility sublease agreement for  square feet of laboratory space and office space located in south san francisco  california  which serves as our new corporate headquarters 
the lease began on october  and will expire on april  the aggregate rent for the term of the lease is approximately million 
in addition  the lease requires us to pay certain taxes  assessments  fees and other costs associated with the premises  in amounts yet to be determined 
we will also be responsible for the costs of certain tenant improvements associated with the leased space 
in connection with the execution of the lease we paid a security deposit of approximately

contractual obligations and related scheduled payments as of december  are as follows in thousands one to three years to four to five years to after five years total facilities leases purchase commitments total at the market stock issuance facility on october   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement  or sales agreement  with mlv co  llc  formerly mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent 
sales of our common stock through mlv will be made on the nasdaq capital market  on any other existing trading market for our common stock  to or through a market maker or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
subject to the terms and conditions of the sales agreement  mlv will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits or other customary parameters or conditions we may impose 
we will pay mlv an aggregate commission rate of of the gross proceeds of the sales price per share of any common stock sold under the sales agreement 
under certain circumstances  sales of the stock under the at market issuances sales agreement could result in an adjustment to the exercise price of certain of our outstanding warrants 
the number of shares we are able to sell under this arrangement will be limited in practice based on the trading volume of our common stock 
as of december  we had not sold any stock pursuant to the sales agreement 
for the year ended december   we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an average price of pursuant to the sales agreement 
net proceeds from the sale of stock were million 
the sales of the stock did not result in an adjustment to the exercise price of certain of our outstanding warrants 
pursuant to an amendment to the at the market issuance sales agreement and a prospectus supplement we filed on january   pursuant to a new registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission  we may sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million from time to time through mlv as our sales agent on the terms and conditions described above 
during february  we sold  shares of our common stock at an average price of pursuant to the sales agreement 
net proceeds from the sale of stock were million 
the sale of stock did not result in an adjustment to the exercise price of certain of our outstanding warrants 
license and development agreements on february   we entered into a global license and co development agreement with merck kgaa  of darmstadt  germany  to co develop and commercialize th  our small molecule hypoxia targeted drug 
under the terms of the agreement  merck will receive co development rights  exclusive global commercialization rights and will provide us an option to co commercialize th in the united states 
in exchange  we will receive an upfront payment of million and could receive another million in additional development milestones that are independent of continued development of th in pancreatic cancer during we are also eligible to receive a million milestone payment based on positive results from its randomized phase trial in pancreatic cancer 
total potential milestone payments are million  comprised of million in regulatory and development milestones and million in sales based milestones 
in the united states  we will have primary responsibility for development of th in the soft tissue sarcoma indication 
we with merck kgaa will jointly develop th in all other cancer indications being pursued 
merck kgaa will pay of worldwide development costs for th subject to fda approval in 
table of contents the united states  merck kgaa will initially be responsible for commercialization of th while we will receive a tiered  double digit royalty on sales 
under the royalty bearing portion of the agreement  we retain the option to co promote th in the united states 
additionally  we retain the option to co commercialize th upon the achievement of certain sales and regulatory milestones  allowing us to participate in up to of the profits in the united states depending on total sales 
outside of the united states  merck kgaa will be solely responsible for the commercialization of th while we will receive a tiered  double digit royalty on sales in these territories 
the agreement became effective on march   upon termination of the applicable waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of the agreement will continue on a country by country basis until the later of the last to expire patent covering th in such country or ten years following the commercial launch of a product containing th in such country  unless terminated earlier 
merck has the right to terminate the agreement after the achievement of certain milestones  and each party has the right to terminate the agreement following uncured material breach by the other party 
on october   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with eleison pharmaceuticals  inc eleison 
pursuant to the agreement we granted eleison exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize glufosfamide for the treatment of cancer in humans and animals  and certain other uses 
under the agreement  eleison is responsible for the development  manufacturing and marketing of glufosfamide 
eleison and threshold will share equally in the profits of commercialization  if the further clinical development of glufosfamide leads to regulatory approval and marketing 
eleison will pay us of its profits from commercialization on a quarterly basis  beginning on the date of first commercial sale  if any 
eleison has the right to sublicense some or all of its rights under the agreement  and will pay us of amounts received under any sublicenses  including  without limitation  any royalty payments  license fee payments  milestone payments and payments for any equity or debt purchases by a sublicensee  within days of the receipt of any such amounts or payments by eleison 
eleison will bear all costs associated with development  commercialization and patent prosecution  and will control product development and commercialization 
in addition  eleison will be responsible for all royalty and milestone payments due under the baxter license and medibic development agreement discussed below 
the agreement contemplates that eleison  to satisfy its diligence obligations  will raise sufficient funds to commence clinical development activities with glufosfamide 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december   and and  accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million in both federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and for federal and state tax purposes  respectively 
our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain limitations on annual utilization in case of changes in ownership  as defined by federal and state tax laws 
at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million and million for federal california state income tax purposes  respectively 
if not utilized the federal carryforward will expire 
table of contents in during the year ended december   the company wrote down its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are expected to expire before utilization due to the annual limitation 
we have not recorded a benefit from our net operating loss or research credit carryforwards because we believe that it is uncertain that we will have sufficient income from future operations to realize the carryforwards prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset arising from the carryforwards 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosures 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and stock purchase rights related to our equity incentive plans under the provisions of asc which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions in implementing asc including expected stock price volatility  expected life and estimated forfeitures of each award 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award  and we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization 
due to the limited amount of historical data available to us  particularly with respect to stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns and forfeitures  actual results could differ from our assumptions 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of asc and asc  equity 
as a result  the non cash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period by changes in the estimated fair value of our common stock  as the underlying equity instruments vest 
the two factors which most affect these changes are the price of the common stock underlying stock options for which stock based compensation is recorded and the volatility of the stock price 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments change  it would have the effect of changing compensation expenses 
fair value of warrants prior to january   common stock warrants were recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging and asc  financial instruments 
however in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance now codified in asc that clarifies the determination of whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  which would qualify for classification as a liability 
the new guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the new guidance on january   resulted in the reclassification of our outstanding warrants from stockholders equity to liability and a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on our deficit accumulated during development stage of million 
in addition  the stock warrants are required to be fair valued at each reporting period  with the changes in fair value 
table of contents recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
we fair value the warrants using a black scholes valuation model 
since the outstanding common stock warrants are fair valued at the end of each reporting period  any change in the underlying assumptions to the black scholes valuation model  including the volatility and price of our common stock  may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
preclinical and clinical trial accruals most of our preclinical and clinical trials are performed by third party contract research organizations  or cros  and clinical supplies are manufactured by contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos 
invoicing from these third parties may be monthly based upon services performed or based upon milestones achieved 
we accrue these expenses based upon our assessment of the status of each clinical trial and the work completed  and upon information obtained from the cros and cmos 
our estimates are dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of data provided by the cros and cmos regarding the status and cost of the studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods or restatement of prior periods 
to date we have had no significant adjustments 
marketable securities we classify all of our marketable securities as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based upon the levels of inputs described below  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest income 
we adopted asc  fair value and measurements  in the first quarter of asc defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
asc also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
our short term investments primarily utilize broker quotes in a non active market for valuation of these securities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
asc requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
if a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy  the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation 
our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis include securities available for sale 
securities available for sale include money market funds  government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds 

table of contents accounting for income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets  as based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 financial value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu provides a consistent definition of fair value and aligns the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu clarifies the application of certain existing fair value measurement guidance and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market funds and investments in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  which currently have weighted average maturity of less than one year 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
however  due to the short duration of our investment portfolio we believe an increase in the interest rates of one percentage point would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
although we conduct some clinical and safety studies  and manufacture some active pharmaceutical product with vendors outside the united states  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars
