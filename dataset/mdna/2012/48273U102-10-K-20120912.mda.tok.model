executive summary we are a technology based education company 
we offer proprietary curriculum  software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning for students primarily in kindergarten through th grade  or k our mission is to maximize a child s potential by providing access to an engaging and effective education  regardless of geographic location or socio economic background 
since our inception  we have invested more than million to develop and  to a lesser extent  acquire curriculum and online learning platforms that promote mastery of core concepts and skills for students of all abilities 
k provides a continuum of technology based educational products and solutions to districts  public schools  private schools  charter schools and families as we strive to transform the educational experience into one that delivers individualized education on a highly scalable basis 
we achieved significant revenue growth during fiscal year  reflecting growth in our traditional online schools  expansion of our institutional business and the impact from our recent acquisitions 
we increased revenues to million  from million  a growth rate of from fiscal our fiscal year results reflect the full year impact of acquisitions completed in our prior fiscal year while fiscal year results include revenue and operating activity only after the dates of the 
table of contents acquisitions 
in addition  our fiscal year revenue includes the full year impact from our acquisition of certain assets of kve on july   which included contracts to serve nine public virtual charter schools in the united states and other assets 
in fiscal year  operating income increased to million  from million in fiscal year  an increase of  net income to stockholders increased to million  from million  an increase of and ebitda  a non gaap measure see reconciliation of net income to ebitda in item selected financial data  increased to million  from million  an increase of 
the increase in our operating income resulted from increased revenue from our organic and acquisition related growth offset by the expense incurred integrating recently acquired entities  increased personnel costs from the growth in the number of our employees and operating expenses associated with our infrastructure investments 
virtual and blended public schools generally under turn key management contracts managed public schools accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal year for the school year  we will manage schools in states and the district of columbia 
we serve an increasing number of schools and school districts enabling them to offer our course catalog to students either full time or on an individual course basis 
we have a growing sales team to focus on this sector and  through our acquisitions of kcdl and aec in  we increased the size and expertise of our sales team  added a reseller network and expanded our course portfolio 
the services we provide to these schools and school districts are designed to assist them in launching their own online learning programs which vary according to the needs of the individual school and school district and may include teacher training programs  administrator support and our peak management system 
with our services  schools and districts can offer programs that allow students to participate full time  as their primary school  or part time  supplementing their education with core courses  electives  credit recovery options  remediation and supplemental content options 
we continued to provide these services to school districts or individual schools in all states and the district of columbia 
we operate three online private schools where parents can enroll students on a tuition basis for a full time online education or individual courses to supplement their children s traditional instruction 
these include our k international academy  an online private school that enables us to offer students worldwide the same full time education programs and curriculum that we provide to the virtual and blended public schools  the keystone school  a private school that offers online and correspondence courses  and the george washington university online high school  a program that offers college preparatory curriculum and is designed for high school students who are seeking a challenging academic experience 
in addition  we own and operate the international school of berne  a traditional private school located in berne  switzerland and a recognized ib school serving students in grades pre k through our history we were founded in to utilize advances in technology to provide children with access to a high quality public school education regardless of their geographic location or socio economic background 
given the geographic flexibility of technology based education  we believed that the pursuit of this mission could help address the growing concerns regarding the regionalized disparity in the quality of public school education  both in the united states and abroad 
the convergence of these concerns and rapid advances in internet networks created the opportunity to make a significant impact by deploying high quality online learning systems on a flexible  online platform 
in september  we introduced our kindergarten through nd grade offering 
we launched our initial online learning system in virtual public schools in pennsylvania and colorado  serving approximately students in the two states combined 
we added new grades over the first seven years 
table of contents and continue to manage schools in more states every year 
we have also launched blended public schools that combine face to face time in the classroom with online instruction and opened an online private school to reach students worldwide 
for the school year  we managed public schools in states and through our institutional business served schools in all states 
for the school year  we have been approved to manage schools in iowa  new jersey and new mexico  bringing the total states with managed public schools to in addition to the district of columbia

recent acquisitions  strategic investments and equity private placement during the last three years  we completed several strategic transactions to accelerate our growth  expand our course catalog and service offerings and extend our distribution capabilities 
while these initiatives have expanded our markets and growth opportunities  we have incurred additional costs associated with acquiring  integrating and operating these acquired businesses 
these include the following 
formation of middlebury interactive languages llc in april  we formed a joint venture with middlebury college  known as mil  to develop online foreign language courses

acquisition of the american education corporation in december  we acquired the stock of aec 
aec is a leading provider of research based core curriculum instructional software for kindergarten through adult learners 
the acquisition increases our portfolio of innovative  high quality instructional courseware and curriculum used by school districts all over the country 
investment in web international education group  ltd 
in january  we invested million to obtain a minority interest in web international education group  ltd 
web 
web is a provider of english language training for learners of all ages throughout china  including university students  government workers and employees of international companies and it maintains an extensive network of learning centers throughout china 
acquisition of international school of berne in april   we acquired the operations of is berne  a traditional private school located in berne  switzerland serving students in grades pre k through is berne is an ib school in its th year of operation 
our purchase provided us with the right to operate is berne and substantially all of its assets excluding real estate 
investment by technology crossover ventures in k inc in april  we completed a private placement sale of million shares of restricted common stock at a price of per share to technology crossover ventures tcv 
the gross proceeds of million were unrestricted and available for acquisitions  strategic investments and general corporate purposes 
under the terms of the transaction  our board of directors board appointed a director nominated by tcv to the board to hold office until our next annual meeting 
additionally  we granted tcv the right to participate on a pro rata basis in any of our subsequent private offerings of common stock  subject to certain exclusions such as issuances in connection with acquisitions or employee equity plans 
as provided by the terms of the transaction  we filed a resale registration statement with respect to these shares with the sec and the registration statement was declared effective on december  
table of contents acquisition of assets from kaplan virtual education in july  we completed the purchase of certain k assets and insight school management contracts of kve  a subsidiary of kaplan  inc kve assets included and contracts to serve online public schools in eight states serving students in grades the acquisition allows us to serve more students with multiple curriculum platforms and leverage the insight school brand and our existing virtual academy operations 
financial statement overview since  our business has evolved significantly  and as a result this impacts the comparability of period to period financial results 
these changes include the acquisition of kcdl in july  the acquisition of aec in december  the acquisition of is berne in april  and the acquisition of kve and insight schools the kaplan insight assets in july for fiscal year  our financial results include a full year of operating activities from these acquisitions 
for fiscal year  our financial results include operating activities since the date of the respective acquisitions and does not include operating results from any of our acquisitions 
these acquisitions accounted for a large portion of the increases in our revenue  student enrollments and operating costs  including transaction and integrations costs  amongst periods 
in addition  we experienced organic growth from the new state schools added in recent years identified above and the continued ramp up in student enrollments and associated variable operating costs from schools opening over the last five years 
our fiscal year results also include operating activities associated with investments to support our growth and business expansion that were not incurred to the same extent during the prior year periods 
these investments include our internal business support systems  a second data center to support operations  and expansion of our products and services into new international  academic and institutional sales markets 
certain business support systems and a second data center were under development during prior periods and development costs were generally capitalized 
we have also incurred additional maintenance and license costs  depreciation and other operating costs associated with operating these assets 
the operating costs associated with maintaining these systems will continue in future periods 
student enrollment in our managed public schools has experienced a shift in the mix of students with an increased level of high school students 
the shift occurred as a result of our acquisition of the kaplan insight assets  which only serve students in grades  and from organic growth in many of the schools we serve 
the continued expansion of our institutional business and our international and private pay business also shifts the mix of our revenue and associated costs of providing services  including additional sales personnel  third party distributor costs and third party royalty costs for our institutional business 
we may continue to experience changes in our enrollment  revenue and cost mix as we continue expansion into markets different than our traditional managed public schools 
our nascent businesses have not yet reached scale and placed downward pressure on our operating margins in fiscal year our headcount growth from approximately  employees at the beginning of to approximately  at the end of our fiscal year  including teachers associated with our enrollment growth  the development of the institutional business  including the expansion of a sales force  and the decision to have more k employed teachers in our managed schools have also directly impacted our operating expenses during the last three years 
during fiscal year  we also incurred additional legal costs defending litigation and increased costs associated with the erp implementation 
we believe that all the above factors  particularly the significant infrastructure investments  acquisitions and the depreciation and amortization associated with our acquired assets and infrastructure investments  reduce the comparability of our operating results between periods 

table of contents funding overview state education budgets remain under pressure due to the continuing slow pace of economic recovery 
public school funding levels  including funding for our managed public schools  have been reduced in several states over the past few years  including even abrupt mid year cuts in certain states  which in some cases were retroactively applied to the start of the school year as a result of formulaic adjustments 
we routinely monitor state legislative activity and regulatory proceedings that might impact the funding received by the schools we serve and  to the extent possible  factor potential outcomes into our business planning decisions 
accordingly  we recognized a reduction in revenue of about during fiscal year related to various state funding issues 
in addition  because of current economic pressures  some states are delaying their payments to public schools 
we experienced delays in receiving payments during the fourth quarter of fiscal year from our managed public schools that depend on receiving state funding before remitting payment to us 
as a result of these deferred payments  we have experienced higher accounts receivable throughout the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  which negatively affected our cash position and cash provided from operations as compared to our normal seasonal pattern of collections 
we currently expect to receive payment from certain states that deferred payment in fiscal during our first quarter of fiscal year key aspects and trends of our operations revenues overview we generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum  management and technology services to managed virtual and blended public schools  where we provide turn key management services 
more than of our revenues were derived from this source in fiscal year we anticipate that these revenues will continue to represent the majority of our total revenues over the next months  however we expect revenues in other aspects of our business to increase as a percentage of revenue of our total revenues as we execute on our growth strategy 
we provide products and services primarily to three lines of business managed public schools  institutional business and international and private pay business 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the mix of enrollments across grades and states  iii management services provided to the schools and school districts  iv state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirements  v prices for our products and services  vi growth in our other customer types  and vii revenues from new initiatives  mergers and acquisitions 
state education budgets remain under pressure due to the continuing slow pace of economic recovery 
public school funding levels  including funding for our managed public schools  have been reduced in several states over the past few years  including even abrupt mid year cuts in certain states  which in some cases were retroactively applied to the start of the school year as a result of formulaic adjustments 
while the american recovery and reinvestment act of and education jobs and medicaid assistance act of provided temporary stimulus funds to states  they did not fully offset the state funding reductions and have generally expired 
our financial results reflect the state funding reductions  federal funds provided and the reduction of federal funds provided  and expense reductions that we undertook to take in order to mitigate the impact of these budget constraints 
net reductions in school funding have negatively affected both revenue and operating results for our last four fiscal 
table of contents years 
many states continue to experience budget issues  including the state of california  where we have virtual and blended public schools in operation 
the specific level of federal  state and district funding for the coming years is not yet known  and taken as a whole  it is reasonable to believe that a number of the public schools we serve  including those served by our institutional business group  may experience lower funding in the future 
our growth strategy includes increasing revenues in other distribution channels  including accelerating institutional business sales  adding enrollments in our private schools and pursuing international opportunities to offer our learning systems 
while the combined revenues from these other sectors were significantly smaller than that from the managed public schools in fiscal year  these revenues are growing at a faster rate 
our success in executing our strategies will impact future growth 
public funding and regulation 
our public school customers are financed with state and local government and  to a lesser extent  federal funding 
budget appropriations for education at all levels of government are determined through a political process and impacted by general economic conditions  and  as a result  our revenues may be affected by changes in appropriations 
decreases in funding could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
competition 
providing online education  including the provision of services to school districts through our institutional business channel  is becoming increasingly competitive 
as this competition intensifies  it could negatively affect our growth  revenues and operating margins 
with the introduction of new technologies and entrants  we expect this competition to intensify 
we are also experiencing significant price competition in our institutional business sector 
this price competition may have a significant impact on both the retention of our existing customers and the acquisition of new institutional business customers 
managed public schools we define an enrollment as a student using our curriculum 
generally  students will take four to six courses  except for some kindergarten students who may participate in half day programs 
we count each half day kindergarten student as an enrollment 
school sessions generally begin in august or september and end in may or june 
to ensure that all schools are reflected in our measure of enrollments  we consider the number of students on the last day of september to be our opening enrollment level  and the number of students enrolled on the last day of may to be our ending enrollment level 
for each period  average enrollments represent the average of the month end enrollment levels for each school month in the period 
we continually evaluate our enrollment levels by state  by school and by grade 
we track new student enrollments and withdrawals throughout the year 
we believe that our revenue growth depends upon the following the number of states and school districts in which we operate  the mix of students served  the restrictive terms of local laws or regulations  including enrollment caps  the appeal of our curriculum and instructional model to students and families  the specific school or school district requirements including credit recovery  advanced placement ap  or special needs  the effectiveness of our program in delivering favorable academic outcomes  the quality of the teachers working in the schools we serve  and the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting programs 

table of contents in fiscal year  we increased total average enrollments by  or  to  as compared to total average enrollments of  or  in fiscal year we continually evaluate our trends in revenues by monitoring the number of enrollments in total  by state  by school and by grade  assessing the impact of changes in school funding levels and the pricing of our curriculum and educational services 
the growth rate of our managed school average enrollments exceeded the growth in revenue principally due to mix shift to high school  the acquisition of the insight schools  reductions in the per pupil rate of achieved state funding in some states  and lower utilization in federal and state restricted funding per managed student 
enrollments in these schools on average generate substantially more revenues than enrollments served through our institutional business where we provide limited or no management services 
similarly  revenues earned per pupil across our private school programs vary 
as we continue to build our institutional business and increase enrollment in international and private pay business  enrollment mix is expected to shift and may impact growth in revenues relative to the growth in enrollments 
in fiscal year  we derived approximately and of our revenues  respectively  from the agora cyber charter school agora in pennsylvania and the ohio virtual academy 
in aggregate  these schools accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we provide our full turn key management solution pursuant to our contract with the ohio virtual academy  which terminates on june  we provide our full turn key solution to the agora pursuant to a contract with the school that expires on june  the annual revenues generated under each of these contracts represent a material portion of our total revenues in fiscal year  however  as our other business sectors grow  these proportions may decrease 
institutional business while managed public schools constitute the bulk of our business  there is a significant emerging demand by school districts  individual schools and other educational institutions for more limited components of our online services and products than are used in managed public schools 
sales to those entities are conducted through our institutional business organizations 
the institutional business portfolio contains an array of curriculum  technology solutions and delivery models with the flexibility to be mapped to specific student  school and district needs 
these options range from full online district programs to individual course offerings 
the institutional business course catalog is comprehensive and enables districts to offer their students educational opportunities that otherwise might not be financially justifiable  such as advanced placement ap  honors  world languages  remediation  credit recovery  alternative education  career and technology electives and college readiness 
we also provide state certified and subject matter expert instructors  professional development and other support services as desired by our customers 
given the variables discussed in further detail below  we believe that the best performance metric for the institutional business is revenues 
historically  for purposes of comparability to the managed public schools  we reported growth in the institutional business on the basis of full time equivalents ftes using a four course conversion factor 
however  we no longer believe that ftes are as useful to understanding the institutional business as when the metric was originally introduced 
with the integration into the institutional business of the educational software services and products of the american education corporation  and the aventa curriculum acquired in the kcdl acquisition  as well as the evolution of our district and school programs  many of the customers served by the institutional business organizations now purchase curriculum in a variety of ways  making consistent comparisons on the basis of enrollments less relevant 
for example  we serve not only full time students  but also students taking semester long courses  students who recover credits through concentrated four to eighteen week programs  students who are using our curricula as a supplemental 
table of contents enhancement to their traditional textbook  and teachers who may present our lessons on an interactive whiteboard as either the core of their instruction or as an engaging supplement to their lecture 
given all these variables  it is therefore difficult to identify a single metric such as an fte  or combination of metrics such as course enrollments or programs sold  that can accurately capture the entirety of the institutional business 
indeed  our efforts to do so led us to the conclusion that at this time  revenue is the best performance metric for the institutional business 
sales opportunities in the institutional business are driven by a number of factors in a diverse customer population  and which determine the deliverable and price 
these factors include type of customer a customer can be a us based public  private or charter school  a district  regional education agency  or a commercial company that provides services to students 
curriculum needs we sell our curriculum solutions based on the scope of the customer need  and a solution is generally purchased as end user access to a complete catalog  individual course or supplemental content title 
license options depending on the scope of the solution  a license can be purchased for individual course enrollments  annual seat  school or district wide site licenses or a perpetual license 
we charge incrementally if we are hosting the solution 
hosting customers may host curricula themselves or license our hosted solution 
we are able to track all students for customers who use our hosted solution 
however  more often in large scale  district wide implementations  a customer may choose to host the curriculum  and in that case we have no visibility of individual student usage for counting enrollments 
service menu instructional services may be provided and priced per enrollment or bundled in the overall price of the solution 
additional services  including professional development  title maintenance and support may also be provided and are priced based on the scope of services 
international and private pay business private schools are managed schools where tuition is paid directly by the family of the student 
we receive no public funds for students in our private schools 
we operate three private online schools at differing price points and service levels 
our revenue is derived from tuition receipts that are a function of course enrollments and program price 
in some circumstances  a third party school may elect to enroll one of its students in a k private school course as a supplement to the student s regular on campus instruction 
in such cases  the third party school may pay the k private school tuition 
our private schools business has evolved over the past two years as we have acquired and developed new private school offerings with different structures and price points 
this has made comparability to our managed public schools business more challenging and the use of full time equivalent metrics no longer as meaningful 
as a result  we have decided to report performance in the private pay business on the basis of the student counts and semester course enrollments which more accurately reflects the way revenues and expenses occur in the business 
student counts tell us how many individual students are being served at any point in time 
as a result of the variation in the number of courses taken by students  we measure the total size of our schools by semester course enrollments sces 
a semester long course is counted as a single sce  and a year long course is counted as two sces 
private school students take courses ranging from a single  semester long k course to a high school course annual load 
for example  a student who takes six courses per semester for two semester accounts for sces 
some of our private school operations  notably keystone and the k international academy  start classes on a monthly or rolling basis 
as a result  there are students in our system of education at any point in time who have just started a course  just finished a course or have partially completed a course 

table of contents we believe our revenue growth depends primarily on the recruitment of students into our programs through effective marketing and word of mouth referral based on the quality of our service 
in addition  through high service quality  we seek to retain existing students and increase the total number of courses each student takes with us 
in some cases  students return each summer and take only one course 
in other cases  students choose a k private school as their principal form of education and may stay for many years 
the flexibility of our programs  the quality of our curriculum and teaching  and the student community features lead to customer satisfaction and therefore  retention 
we have entered into agreements which enable us to distribute our products and services to over  school partners throughout the world that use our courses as a supplement to their on campus academic programs 
these courses provide students with additional electives  advanced placement ap courses  and sometimes include dual degree programs that the school cannot offer on its own 
student enrollments derived from partner school programs are included in the count of sces for these private schools 
we sometimes offer additional teacher assistance  counseling  clubs and other additive services to our basic course offerings 
these additive services may carry additional fees that appear in our revenue 
we also have an operating agreement with is berne  a traditional private school in switzerland 
enrollments and revenue from is berne are included in our private school totals along with the numbers from our online school operations 
we do not include students in our consumer sales business as we do not monitor the progress of these students in the same way as we do in our other programs 
instructional costs and services expenses instructional costs and services expenses include expenses directly attributable to the educational products and services we provide 
the managed public schools we manage are the primary drivers of these costs  including teacher and administrator salaries and benefits and expenses of related support services 
we also employ teachers and administrators for instruction and oversight in our institutional business and international and private business sectors 
instructional costs also include fulfillment costs of student textbooks and materials  depreciation and reclamation costs of computers provided for student use  the cost of any third party online courses and the amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems 
our instructional costs are variable and are based directly on our number of schools and enrollments 
in the near term  we expect high school enrollments to continue to grow as a percentage of total enrollments 
our high school offering requires increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenue compared to our kindergarten to th grade offering 
this is due to the following i generally lower student to teacher ratios  ii higher compensation costs for some teaching positions requiring subject matter expertise  iii ancillary costs for required student support services  including college placement  sat preparation and guidance counseling  iv use of third party courses to augment our proprietary curriculum  and v use of a third party learning management system to service high school students 
over time  we may partially offset these factors by obtaining productivity gains in our high school instructional model  replacing third party high school courses with proprietary content  possibly replacing our third party learning management system with a proprietary system  leveraging our school infrastructure and obtaining purchasing economies of scale 
we have deployed and are continuing to develop new delivery models  including blended schools  where students receive face to face instruction in a learning center to complement their online instruction  and other programs that utilize brick and mortar facilities 
the maintenance  management and operations of these facilities necessitate additional costs  which are generally not required to operate typical virtual public schools 
we are pursuing expansion into new states for both virtual public and other specialized charter schools 
if we are successful  we will incur start up costs and other 
table of contents expenses associated with the initial launch of a school  including the funding of building leases and leasehold improvements 
selling  administrative and other operating expenses selling  administrative and other operating expenses include the salaries and benefits employees engaged in business development  public affairs  sales and marketing  and administrative functions and transaction and due diligence expenses related to mergers and acquisitions 
product development expenses product development expenses include research and development costs and overhead costs associated with the management of both our curriculum development and internal systems development teams 
in addition  product development expenses include the amortization of internal systems and any related impairment charges 
we measure and track our product development expenditures on a per course or project basis to measure and assess our development efficiency 
in addition  we monitor employee utilization rates to evaluate our workforce efficiency 
in fiscal year  product development expenses increased because of the number and types of products we maintain  and due to timing and other factors  capitalized costs were less than in fiscal year we plan to continue to invest in additional curriculum development and related software in the future  primarily to produce additional high school courses  world language courses and new releases of existing courses and to continue to upgrade our content management system and online schools 
we capitalize selected costs incurred to develop our curriculum  beginning with application development  through production and testing into capitalized curriculum development costs 
we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop internal systems into capitalized software development costs 
expense management we are constantly searching for ways to deliver more value at a lower cost for our customers and we take pride in our ability to deliver highly individualized  effective education solutions at a significant savings to taxpayers 
over the past several years  the recession has negatively impacted state education funding to many of the schools we serve  which we have sought to mitigate by increasing efficiencies whenever possible without affecting educational quality 
given the large number of teachers we employ or manage  our ability to reduce costs in our business model is partially limited 
our increasing scale and infrastructure investments  however  position us for greater efficiency in future periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of 
table of contents our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of physical goods or rendering of services is complete  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we have determined that the separate elements of our multiple element contracts with managed schools do not have standalone value 
accordingly  we account for revenues received under multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement over the term of the contractual service period 
while we have concluded that the elements of our contracts do not have standalone value  we invoice schools in accordance with the established contractual terms and rates 
generally  this means that for each enrolled student  we invoice their school on a per student basis for the following items access to our online school and online curriculum  learning kits  and student computers 
we also invoice for management and technology services 
we apply asc to each of these items as follows access to the online school and online curriculum 
our proprietary learning management system ols revenues are generally earned on a per course basis from schools and school districts 
students enrolled through a school are provided access to the ols and online curriculum 
revenues are earned ratably over the school year  typically months  or over the semester depending on the length of the course 
learning kits 
the lessons in our online school are often accompanied with selected printed materials  workbooks  laboratory materials and other manipulative items which we provide to students 
we generally ship all learning kits to a student when their enrollment is approved 
once materials have been shipped  our efforts are substantially complete 
therefore  we recognize revenues upon shipment 
shipments to schools that occur in the fourth fiscal quarter that are for the following school year are recorded in deferred revenues 
we also earn reclamation fee income when we reclaim materials for schools at the end of the school year or when a student withdraws from the school 
student computers 
we provide many enrolled students with the use of a personal computer and complete technical support through our call center 
revenues are generally earned ratably over the school year and we also earn revenues for reclamation services when a student withdraws from a school and returns the computer which may occur in a subsequent school year 
management  technology and educational services 
under most of our statewide virtual public and blended school contracts  we provide the boards of managed schools with turn key management and technology services 
we recognize these revenues ratably over our fiscal year as administrative offices of the school remain open for the entire year 
our management and technology service fees are generally a contracted percentage of yearly school funding 
we review our estimates of funding periodically  and revise as necessary  amortizing any adjustments to earned revenues over the remaining portion of the fiscal year 
actual school funding may vary from these estimates  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school funding 
we closely monitor the financial performance of the schools to which we provide turn key management services 
under the contracts with these schools  we generally take responsibility for any operating expenses that they may incur in a given school year  which include our charges for products 
table of contents and services 
in some cases  the school operating expenses may exceed the revenues earned by the school resulting in an operating loss for the school 
a school operating loss may result from a combination of cost increases or funding reductions attributable to the following costs associated with new schools including the initial hiring of teachers  administrators and the establishment of school infrastructure  school requirements to establish contingency reserves  one time costs  such as a legal claim  funding reductions due to the inability to qualify specific students for funding  regulatory or academic performance thresholds which may restrict the ability of a school to fund all expenses  inadequate school funding in particular states  providing services without receiving state funding when enrollments occur after enrollment count dates  and or burdensome regulation creating excessive costs 
we generate a small percentage of our revenues from the sale of perpetual licenses of curriculum and ongoing support to schools 
under asc  we account for the license and support of separate units of accounting and recognize revenues associated with the license up front and ongoing maintenance and support over the performance period 
we also generate a small percentage of our revenues through the sale of our online courses and learning kits directly to consumers 
we record revenue for consumer services over the term of the class subscription 
capitalized curriculum development costs our curriculum is primarily developed by our employees and  to a lesser extent  by independent contractors 
generally  our courses cover traditional subjects and utilize examples and references designed to remain relevant for long periods of time 
the online nature of our curriculum allows us to incorporate user feedback rapidly and make ongoing corrections and improvements 
for these reasons  we believe that our courses  once developed  have an extended useful life  similar to computer software 
we also create textbooks and other offline materials 
our curriculum is integral to our learning systems 
our customers generally do not acquire our curriculum or future rights to it 
due to the similarity in development stages and long economic life of curriculum to computer software  we capitalize curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with asc  intangibles 
asc provides guidance for the treatment of costs associated with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed 
costs that qualify for capitalization are external direct costs  payroll and payroll related costs 
costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalizable and are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize curriculum development costs during the design  development and deployment phases of the project 
many of our new courses leverage off of proven delivery platforms and are primarily content  which has no technological hurdles 
as a result  a significant portion of our courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of the courseware 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities necessary to establish that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
capitalized costs are recorded in capitalized curriculum development costs 
the period of time over which these 
table of contents development costs will be amortized is generally five years 
this is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and corresponds with our product development lifecycle 
software developed or obtained for internal use we develop our own proprietary computer software programs to provide specific functionality to support both our unique education offerings and the student and school management services 
these programs enable us to develop courses  process student enrollments  meet state documentation requirements  track student academic progress  deliver online courses to students  coordinate and track the delivery of course specific materials to students and provide teacher support and training 
these applications are integral to our learning systems and we continue to enhance existing applications and create new applications 
our customers do not acquire our software or future rights to it 
we capitalize software development costs incurred during development in accordance with asc  intangibles 
these capitalized development costs are included in capitalized software development costs and are generally amortized over three years 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets include property  equipment  capitalized curriculum and software developed or obtained for internal use 
in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  we review our recorded long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we determine the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon our expectation of the asset s future usability as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
there were no impairment charges for the fiscal years ended june   and income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
asc prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established  based on the weight of available evidence  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
we expect substantially all of our deferred tax assets to be fully utilized and have established a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of million as of june  to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
due to our federal net operating loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes in the next twelve months  other than the alternative minimum tax 

table of contents we currently expect the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards to be utilized during our fiscal year and to begin making more significant federal income tax payments during our fiscal year 
accounting for stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense under the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options at their respective grant date 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the option 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is the fair market value on the date of grant 
we recognize these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
during to  we granted more restricted stock awards  resulting in increased stock based compensation that will be recognized over the required service periods 
in addition  the vesting period is generally three years for restricted stock compared to four years for stock options 
the increase in restricted stock awards and the shorter vesting period has increased our stock based compensation costs  and this increased cost is expected to continue in future periods 
goodwill and other intangibles we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
finite lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations subject to amortization are recorded at their fair value 
finite lived intangible assets include the trade names  customer contracts and curriculum and such intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives based on third party valuations 
we periodically evaluate the remaining useful lives of intangible assets and adjust our amortization period if it is determined that such intangible assets have a shorter useful life 
our goodwill and other intangibles  and amortization of other intangible assets  have increased over the last two years with our recent acquisitions 
we evaluate the recoverability of our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or whenever a triggering event of impairment may occur 
for the fiscal years ended june   and  no impairment to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets was recorded 
consolidation of noncontrolling interest our consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations of our middle east and middlebury interactive languages joint ventures 
earnings or losses attributable to our partner are classified as net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
net income or net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest adjusts our consolidated net results of operations to reflect only our share of the after tax earnings or losses of an affiliated company 
redeemable noncontrolling interest in the formation of our joint venture with middlebury college  at any time after the fifth th anniversary of the agreement may  middlebury may give written notice of its irrevocable election to sell all but not less than all of its membership interest put right to us 
the purchase price for middlebury s membership interest shall be its fair market value and we may  in our sole discretion  pay the purchase price in cash or shares of our common stock 
the agreement also includes a provision whereby  if certain milestones are not met related to expanding the business by june  middlebury will have the option to repurchase certain contributed assets at their fair market value 
given the provision of the put right  the redeemable noncontrolling interest is redeemable outside of our control and it is recorded outside of permanent equity at its redemption value  which 
table of contents approximates fair value  in accordance with asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity 
we adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest to redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in redemption value recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings  or in the absence of retained earnings  by adjustment to additional paid in capital 
the redeemable value as of the end of each fiscal year is based on a third party valuation  while the redeemable value during interim periods is based on management updates from the date of the most recent independent valuation 
as of june   the estimated redeemable noncontrolling interest was million 
investment in web international education group  ltd 
we have recorded our minority investment in web as an available for sale debt security because of our ability to put the investment to other web shareholders in return for the original million purchase price plus interest 
accordingly  the operating results of web were not reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the fiscal year ended june   there was no change to the fair value of our web investment from our initial investment costs based on web s financial performance  management s assessment of fair value and web s cash balance that was deemed sufficient to repay the initial investment plus interest

revenue for the managed public schools grew year over year  while total average enrollment growth for managed public schools students grew by 
revenue grew at a lower rate principally as a result of our acquisition of the kaplan insight assets  specific reductions in the per pupil rate of achieved state funding  and lower utilization in federal and state restricted funding per managed student instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in instructional and administrative costs of million  an increase in materials and computers costs of million  and an increase in amortization of curriculum and online learning systems of million 
our instructional costs and services expenses grew in similar proportion to the growth in revenue as these generally are variable costs directly associated with student enrollments 
as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs and services expenses were relatively flat at for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
selling  administrative and other operating expenses 
selling  administrative and other operating expenses for the year ended june  were million  representing an increase of million  or  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year

as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs and services expenses increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to increased 
table of contents amortization of curriculum and online learning systems  expenses for new initiatives that did not have the corresponding growth in revenues in the year  and an increase in the percentage of high school enrollments relative to total enrollments  as high school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to increased teacher and related services costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower fulfillment costs for materials and computers  increased productivity at the schools we manage  and leverage of fixed school infrastructure costs

table of contents discussion of seasonality of financial condition certain accounts in our balance sheet are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
as our enrollments and revenues grow  we expect these seasonal trends to be amplified 
the bulk of our materials are shipped to students prior to the beginning of the school year  usually in july or august 
in order to prepare for the upcoming school year  we generally build up inventories during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
therefore  inventories tend to be at the highest levels at the end of our fiscal year 
in the first quarter of our fiscal year  inventories tend to decline significantly as materials are shipped to students 
in our fourth quarter  inventory purchases and the extent to which we utilize early payment discounts will impact the level of accounts payable 
accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the first quarter of our fiscal year as we begin billing for all enrolled students and our billing arrangements include upfront fees for many of the elements of our offering 
these upfront fees result in seasonal fluctuations to our deferred revenue balances 
state education budgets  which remain under pressure due to the current economic environment and public school funding levels  including for the online public schools that we manage  have been reduced in many states over the past few years and even mid year adjustments have occurred 
we routinely monitor state legislative activity and regulatory proceedings that might impact the funding received by the schools we serve and to the extent possible  factor potential outcomes into our business planning decisions 
we have taken reserves during fiscal in light of certain funding proposals and for individual school deficit allowances in several states 
in addition  because of current economic pressures on state funding  some states are delaying their payments to public schools 
we have experienced delays in receiving payments from our managed public schools that depend on state funding before remitting payment to us 
as a result of these deferred payments  we have experienced higher accounts receivable throughout the second half of fiscal year than prior years and our accounts receivable balance at june  was substantially higher than experienced in prior years 
we currently expect to receive deferred payments from one of our largest states in the first quarter of fiscal year generally  deferred revenue balances related to the schools tend to be highest in the first quarter  when the majority of students enroll 
since the deferred revenue is amortized over the course of the school year  which typically ends in may or june  the balance is normally at its lowest at the end of our fiscal year 
generally  deferred revenues from virtual and blended public schools have not been a source of liquidity as most schools receive their funding over the course of the school year 
the deferred revenue related to our direct to consumer business results from advance payments for month subscriptions to our online school 
these advance payments are amortized over the life of the subscription and tend to be highest at the end of the fourth quarter and first quarter  when the majority of subscriptions are sold 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had net working capital  or current assets minus current liabilities  of million 
our working capital includes cash and cash equivalents of million  including million associated with our two joint ventures  and accounts receivable of million 
our working capital provides a significant source of liquidity for our normal operating needs 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the fiscal year based on the timing of customer billings and collections and tends to be highest in the first fiscal quarter as we begin billing for students 
in addition  our cash and accounts receivable were significantly in excess of our accounts payable and short term accrued liabilities at june  we have a million revolving credit agreement with pnc bank  na pnc for general corporate operating purposes the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides the ability to fund periods until cash is received from the schools 
the credit agreement matures in december 
table of contents and we currently expect to enter into a new line of credit agreement prior to termination of the existing line of credit  although there can be no guarantee that we will do so 
interest is charged  at our option  either at i the higher of a the rate of interest announced by pnc from time to time as its prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  or ii the applicable london interbank offered rate libor divided by a number equal to  minus the maximum aggregate reserve requirement which is imposed on member banks of the federal reserve system against eurocurrency liabilities  plus the applicable margin for such loans  which ranges between and  based on the leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreement 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion available under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes a million letter of credit facility 
issuance of letters of credit reduces the availability of permitted borrowings under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains a number of financial and other covenants that  among other things  restrict our and our subsidiaries abilities to incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  or other security interests  make certain investments  become liable for contingent liabilities  make specified restricted payments  including dividends  dispose of assets or stock  including the stock of our subsidiaries  or make capital expenditures above specified limits and engage in other matters customarily restricted in senior secured credit facilities 
we must also maintain a maximum debt leverage ratio 
these covenants are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions 
as of june   we were in compliance with these covenants 
as of june   no borrowings were outstanding on the line of credit and approximately million was reserved for a letter of credit 
we incur capital lease obligations under a lease line of credit with pnc equipment finance  llc with annual borrowing limits 
capital lease borrowings are repaid over three years following the incurrence of a lease with a bargain purchase option at the end of the term 
we have pledged the assets financed under the equipment lease line of credit to secure the amounts outstanding 
during fiscal year  we had million available under our lease line of credit which was fully utilized to acquire student computers and related hardware during fiscal in july  our availability under the lease line of credit was increased to million for student computer leasing during our fiscal year 
this borrowing availability expires in august and interest rates on the new borrowings are based upon an initial rate of modified by changes in the three year interest rate swaps rate as published in the federal reserve statistical release h  selected interest rates  between june  and the lease commencement date 
our cash requirements consist primarily of day to day operating expenses  capital expenditures and contractual obligations with respect to facility leases  capital equipment leases and other operating leases 
we lease all of our office facilities 
we expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
we believe that the combination of funds to be generated from operations  net working capital on hand and access to our line of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  to a lesser degree  we continue to explore acquisitions  strategic investments and joint ventures related to our business that we may acquire using cash  stock  debt  contribution of assets or a combination thereof 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  was million  compared to million for the year ended june  cash from operations is impacted by the timing of cash collections from products and services provided and payment of operating costs to fund the continued growth and expansion of our business 
the decrease in cash from operations from the prior year was primarily the result of increases in accounts receivable and  to a lesser extent  inventories 
our accounts receivable increased in fiscal because of the increase in the number of schools under our management and increased payment delays from certain managed schools that 
table of contents depend on state funding before remitting payment to us 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was also attributable to our acquisition of the kaplan insight assets  where we did not acquire working capital  to our growth initiatives such as expansion of our flex schools  and growth in the number of schools and students supported 
our inventories have increased due to normal late year purchasing as we build up inventories for materials shipment to students during the first quarter of fiscal year and the additional materials required to support new schools opening in fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended june  of million 
while net income decreased  cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization  a reduction in growth of accounts receivable and increases in accounts payable  stock compensation expense and deferred rent 
offsetting these factors was an increase in cash used in inventories and a decrease in deferred income taxes 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the years ended  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  was primarily due to investment of million in property and equipment  including internally developed and purchased software  investment in capitalized curriculum of million  primarily related to the production of high school courses and elementary school math courses and the purchase of certain assets from kve for million

table of contents million 
these amounts were partially offset by payments on capital leases and notes payable totaling million 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist primarily of leases for office space  capital leases for equipment and other operating leases 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of june   which increased from approximately million as of june  due to increases in our leased student computers and office space rental commitment for years ended june  total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations at june  capital leases operating leases long term obligations total includes interest expense 
for the schools where we provide turn key management services  we typically take responsibility for any school operating losses that the school may incur 
these individual school operating losses  if they occur  are recorded at the time as a reduction in revenues 
potential school operating losses are not included as a commitment or obligation in the above table as they cannot be determined at this time and many not even occur 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided guarantees of approximately million related to lease commitments on the buildings for certain of our flex schools 
we contractually guarantee that certain schools under our management will not have annual operating deficits and our management fees from these schools may be reduced accordingly to cover any school operating deficits 
other than these lease and operating deficit guarantees  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for any of the years in the three year period ended june  we cannot assure you that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which provides authoritative guidance on disclosure requirements for comprehensive income 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  the company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance will be effective for the company beginning on july  the company does not expect the guidance to

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at june  and june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
future interest and investment income is subject to the impact of interest rate changes and we may be subject to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
at june   a gross increase in interest rates earned on cash would result in million annualized increase in interest income 
our short term debt obligations under our revolving credit facility are subject to interest rate exposure  however as we had no outstanding balance on this facility as of june   fluctuations in interest rates would not have any impact on our interest expense 
foreign currency exchange risk we currently operate in several foreign countries  but we do not transact a material amount of business in a foreign currency and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  we are pursuing additional opportunities in international markets and expect our international presence to grow 
if we enter into any material transactions in a foreign currency or establish or acquire any subsidiaries that measure and record their financial condition and results of operation in a foreign currency  we will be exposed to currency transaction risk and or currency translation risk 
exchange rates between us dollars and many foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future 
accordingly  we may decide in the future to undertake hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations
