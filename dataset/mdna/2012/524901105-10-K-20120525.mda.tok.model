item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates intangible assets and goodwill 
our deferred tax assets may not be fully realizable as of march   we had approximately million in us federal deferred tax assets  which represent tax benefits that we expect to realize in future periods 
under accounting rules  we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets if it is determined that any future tax benefits are not likely to be realized before they expire 
deferred tax assets generated in us jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire years after they are generated 
those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire years after they are generated 
in order to realize these future tax benefits  we estimate that we must generate approximately billion in future us earnings  approximately million of which must be in the form of foreign source income  before the benefits expire 
there can be no assurances that we will achieve this level of earnings before some portion of these tax benefits expires 
in addition  our belief that we will likely be able to realize these future tax benefits is based in part upon our estimates of the timing of other differences in revenue and expense recognition between tax returns and financial statements and our understanding of the application of tax regulations  which may prove to be incorrect for any number of reasons  including future changes in tax or accounting regulations 
if we are required to recognize a charge to earnings to reduce our deferred tax assets  the charge may be material to our earnings or financial condition 
we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations our asset managers operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states on behalf of international clients 
we have offices in numerous countries and many cross border and local proprietary funds that are domiciled outside the united states 
our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of various foreign jurisdictions  expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions and subject us to expropriation risks  expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences which  among other things  make it more difficult to repatriate to the united states the cash that we generate outside the us at march   our total cash and cash equivalents of billion included approximately million held by our foreign subsidiaries  some of which  if repatriated  may be subject to material tax effects 
our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks difficulty in managing  operating and marketing our international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under management and revenues in our us dollar based financial statements  and significant adverse changes in foreign legal and regulatory environments 
legal and regulatory risks regulatory matters may negatively affect our business and results of operations our business is subject to regulation by various regulatory authorities that are charged with protecting the interests of our clients 
we could be subject to civil liability  criminal liability  or sanction  including revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisers  revocation of the licenses of our employees  censures  fines  or temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business  if we violate such laws or regulations 
any such liability or sanction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  reputation  and business prospects 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years 
in particular  we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant additional costs as a result of regulatory changes affecting us mutual funds and changes to european mutual fund regulation  including the eu directive on undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities directives ucits and the alternative investment fund managers directive 
furthermore  the sec has proposed replacing rule b under the investment company act of  which regulates certain fees that may be paid to mutual fund distributors  with a new regulation that would significantly change fund distribution practices in the industry 
this proposal  if adopted  could increase our operational and compliance costs and may affect our ability to compensate distributors for selling our products 
we also expect to spend time and money to comply with the requirements of the us foreign account tax compliance act 
our business and results of operations can also be adversely affected by federal  state and foreign regulatory issues and proceedings 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 
for example  we note that the federal government has made  and has proposed further  significant changes to the regulatory structure of the financial services industry  and we expect to spend time and resources to comply with these regulatory changes 
we also note that recommendations for regulatory reform in the liquidity asset management business include the possible imposition of banking and banking like regulations on liquidity funds and their managers 
currently  sec officials have stated publicly that the agency is considering proposing additional regulations for money market funds that are designed to address certain concerns arising from the financial crisis 
among the changes the sec says it is considering are a possible requirement that money market funds have a capital buffer  the imposition of redemption holdbacks  and a requirement that money market funds convert to a floating net asset value 
if adopted  these proposals  which also have been publicly supported by a number of federal banking officials  could significantly impact the money market fund industry 
depending on the nature of any changes adopted  the new regulations could  among other things  reduce the attractiveness of money market funds to retail and institutional investors and raise the costs of being in this business 
although the sec has not proposed any specific regulations to date  we continue to monitor this area carefully and  if new regulations are adopted  we will consider how they affect our liquidity management business and take action  as appropriate 
any of these revisions could adversely affect our liquidity asset management business and our results of operations 
instances of criminal activity and fraud by participants in the asset management industry  disclosures of trading and other abuses by participants in the financial services industry and significant governmental intervention and investment in the financial markets and financial firms have led the us government and regulators to increase the rules and regulations governing  and oversight of  the us financial system 
this activity has resulted in changes to the laws and regulations governing the asset management industry and more aggressive enforcement of the existing laws and regulations 
for example  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the us provides for a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services regulatory environment and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and many regulatory decisions to be implemented 
these revisions to the laws and regulations are an ongoing process 
the cumulative effect of these actions may result in increased expenses  or lower management or other fees  and therefore adversely affect the revenues or profitability of our business 
our business involves risks of being engaged in litigation and liability that could increase our expenses and reduce our net income many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability 
in the normal course of business  our asset managers are from time to time named as defendants or co defendants in lawsuits  or are involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits  seeking substantial damages 
for example  one of our asset managers was named as the defendant in a lawsuit filed by a former institutional client seeking damages in excess of million 
although we believe the claims are without merit  no assurances can be given that this lawsuit will not adversely impact our expenses or net income 
we are also involved from time to time in governmental and self regulatory organization investigations and proceedings 
similarly  the investment funds that our asset managers manage are subject to actual and threatened lawsuits and governmental and self regulatory organization investigations and proceedings  any of which could harm the investment returns or reputation of the applicable fund or result in our asset managers being liable to the funds for any resulting damages 
there has been an increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the asset management industry in recent years  including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages 
any litigation can increase our expenses and reduce our net income 
insurance may not be available on a cost effective basis to protect us from liability we face the inherent risk of liability related to litigation from clients  third party vendors or others and actions taken by regulatory agencies 
to help protect against these potential liabilities  we purchase insurance in amounts  and against risks  that we consider appropriate  where such insurance is available at prices we deem acceptable 
there can be no assurance  however  that a claim or claims will be covered by insurance or  if covered  will not exceed the limits of available insurance coverage  that any insurer will remain solvent and will meet its obligations to provide us with coverage or that insurance coverage will continue to be available with sufficient limits at a reasonable cost 
insurance costs are impacted by market conditions and the risk profile of the insured  and may increase significantly over relatively short periods 
in addition  certain insurance coverage may not be available or may only be available at prohibitive costs 
renewals of insurance policies may expose us to additional costs through higher premiums or the assumption of higher deductibles or co insurance liability

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of our lease obligations 
item legal proceedings 
our current and former subsidiaries have been the subject of customer complaints and have also been named as defendants in various legal actions arising primarily from securities brokerage  asset management and investment banking activities  including certain class actions  which primarily allege violations of securities laws and seek unspecified damages  which could be substantial 
for example  we are aware of litigation against certain underwriters of offerings in which one or more of our former subsidiaries was a participant  but where the former subsidiary is not now a defendant 
in these latter cases  it is possible that we may be called upon to contribute to settlements or judgments 
in the normal course of our business  our current and former subsidiaries have also received subpoenas and are currently involved in governmental and self regulatory agency inquiries  investigations and  from time to time  proceedings involving asset management activities 
in the transaction with citigroup  we transferred to citigroup the subsidiaries that constituted our private client brokerage and capital markets businesses  thus transferring the entities that would have primary liability for most of the customer complaint  litigation and regulatory liabilities and proceedings arising from those businesses 
however  as part of that transaction  we agreed to indemnify citigroup for most customer complaint  litigation and regulatory liabilities of our former private client brokerage and capital markets businesses that result from pre closing events 
in addition  the asset management business we acquired from citigroup is a defendant in a number of legal actions  including class action litigation  arising from pre closing asset management activities  some of which seek substantial damages 
under the terms of the transaction agreement with citigroup  citigroup has agreed to indemnify us for certain legal matters  including all currently known pre closing legal matters  of the former cam business 
while the ultimate resolution of any pre closing matters threatened or pending from our prior brokerage and capital markets businesses or the former cam business cannot be determined at this time  based on current information and after consultation with legal counsel  management believes that any accrual or range of reasonably possible losses as of march  is not material 
while the ultimate resolution of any other threatened or pending litigation and other matters cannot be currently determined  in the opinion of our management  after consultation with legal counsel  due in part to the preliminary nature of certain of these matters  we are currently unable to estimate the amount or range of potential losses from these matters  and our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected during a period in which a matter is ultimately resolved

executive overview legg mason  inc  a holding company  with its subsidiaries which collectively comprise legg mason is a global asset management firm 
acting through our subsidiaries  we provide investment management and related services to institutional and individual clients  company sponsored mutual funds and other investment vehicles 
we offer these products and services directly and through various financial intermediaries 
we have operations principally in the united states of america us and the united kingdom us and also have offices in australia  bahamas  brazil  canada  chile  china  dubai  france  germany  italy  japan  luxembourg  poland  singapore  spain  switzerland and taiwan 
all references to fiscal  or  refer to our fiscal year ended march of that year 
terms such as we  us  our  and company refer to legg mason 
in connection with a realignment of our executive management team during fiscal  we no longer manage our business in two divisions and  during fiscal  eliminated the previous separation of the americas and international divisions and combined them into one operating segment  global asset management 
we believe this structure allows us to function as a global organization with a single purpose 
as a result of this change  we no longer present assets under management aum or revenues by division 
our operating revenues primarily consist of investment advisory fees  from separate accounts and funds  and distribution and service fees 
investment advisory fees are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets of the investment portfolios that we manage 
in addition  performance fees may be earned under certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
distribution and service fees are fees received for distributing investment products and services or for providing other support services to investment portfolios  and are generally calculated as a percentage of the assets in an investment portfolio or as a percentage of new assets added to an investment portfolio 
our revenues  therefore  are dependent upon the level of our aum and fee rates  and thus are affected by factors such as securities market conditions  our ability to attract and maintain aum and key investment personnel  and investment performance 
our aum primarily vary from period to period due to inflows and outflows of client assets as well as market performance 
client decisions to increase or decrease their assets under our management  and decisions by potential clients to utilize our services  may be based on one or more of a number of factors 
these factors include our reputation in the marketplace  the investment performance  both absolute and relative to benchmarks or competitive products  of our products and services  the fees we charge for our investment services  the client or potential client s situation  including investment objectives  liquidity needs  investment horizon and amount of assets managed  our relationships with distributors and the external economic environment  including market conditions 
the fees that we charge for our investment services vary based upon factors such as the type of underlying investment product  the amount of assets under management  the asset management affiliate that provides the services  and the type of services and investment objectives that are provided 
fees charged for equity asset management services are generally higher than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity asset management services 
accordingly  our revenues will be affected by the composition of our aum 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we may reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our asset management affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
as such  our net income attributable to legg mason  inc  operating margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one affiliate can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another affiliate 
in addition  from time to time we may agree to changes in revenue sharing agreements and other arrangements with our asset management personnel  which may impact our compensation expenses and profitability 
the most significant component of our cost structure is employee compensation and benefits  of which a majority is variable in nature and includes incentive compensation that is primarily based upon revenue levels  non compensation related operating expense levels at revenue share based affiliates  and profits 
the next largest component of our cost structure is distribution and servicing expense  which are primarily fees paid to third party distributors for selling our asset management products and services and are largely variable in nature 
certain other operating costs are fixed in nature  such as occupancy  depreciation and amortization  and fixed contract commitments for market data  communication and technology services  and usually do not decline with reduced levels of business activity or  conversely  usually do not rise proportionately with increased business activity 
our financial position and results of operations are materially affected by the overall trends and conditions of the financial markets  particularly in the united states  but also in the other countries in which we operate 
results of any individual period should not be considered representative of future results 
our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the amount and composition of our aum  and the volatility and general level of securities prices and interest rates  among other things 
periods of unfavorable market conditions are likely to affect our profitability adversely 
in addition  the diversification of services and products offered  investment performance  access to distribution channels  reputation in the market  attracting and retaining key employees and client relations are significant factors in determining whether we are successful in attracting and retaining clients 
in the last few years  the industry has seen flows into products for which we do not currently garner significant market share 
in addition  the economic downturn of fiscal years and contributed to a significant contraction in our business and we have not recovered to pre downturn levels 
the financial services business in which we are engaged is extremely competitive 
our competition includes numerous global  national  regional and local asset management firms  broker dealers and commercial banks 
the industry has been impacted by continued economic uncertainty  and in prior years  by the consolidation of financial services firms through mergers and acquisitions 
the industry in which we operate is also subject to extensive regulation under federal  state  and foreign laws 
like most firms  we have been impacted by regulatory and legislative changes 
responding to these changes has required  and will continue to require  us to incur costs that continue to impact our profitability 
our strategy is focused on three primary areas listed below 
management keeps these strategic priorities in mind when it evaluates our operating performance and financial condition 
consistent with this approach  we have also listed below the most important matters on which management currently focuses in evaluating our performance and financial condition 
outstanding independent investment managers the investment performance of our asset management products and services compared to their benchmarks and to the performance of competitive products for the trailing year  year  year  and year periods 
our aum  the components of the changes in our aum amid continued market uncertainty  the long term trend of outflows in aum  and the resulting impact of changes in aum on our revenues 
a corporate center that delivers strategic value promote revenue growth through strategic marketing of products to institutional clients  supported by retail and instividual eg  k plans distribution globally 
management of expenses 
allocating capital for diversified growth and returning capital to shareholders as appropriate the amount of excess capital we generate  and deployment of that capital through share repurchases  investments in proprietary fund products  dividends and targeted acquisitions 
the following discussion and analysis provides additional information regarding our financial condition and results of operations 
business environment and results of operations although the financial environment  both globally and in the us  continued to rebound during fiscal  challenging and volatile conditions persisted throughout a portion of our fiscal year 
economic uncertainties related to the european debt crisis slowed the global economy  and the unprecedented downgrade to the us credit rating in august contributed to a sharp decline in the equity markets during the first half of fiscal in spite of the challenging conditions during the first half of our fiscal year  economic interventions which eased the european debt crisis  and continuing improvement in us employment rates and consumer confidence  resulted in equity market increases during the second half of the fiscal year which more than offset earlier market declines 
during fiscal  the federal reserve board held the federal funds rate at  the lowest in history 
while the economic outlook has been more positive than in recent years  the financial environment in which we operate continues to be challenging  as we move into fiscal all three major us equity market indices  as well as the barclays capital us aggregate bond index and barclays capital global aggregate bond index  increased significantly during the past two fiscal years as illustrated in the table below change as of and for the year ended march indices dow jones industrial average s p nasdaq composite index barclays capital us aggregate bond index barclays capital global aggregate bond index indices are trademarks of dow jones company  mcgraw hill companies  inc  nasdaq stock market  inc  and barclays capital  respectively  which are not affiliated with legg mason 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  amounts in the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of operating revenues and the increase decrease by item as a percentage of the amount for the previous period percentage of operating revenues period to period change years ended march  compared compared to to operating revenues investment advisory fees separate accounts funds performance fees distribution and service fees other total operating revenues operating expenses compensation and benefits transition related compensation n m total compensation and benefits distribution and servicing communications and technology occupancy amortization of intangible assets other total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest income interest expense fund support n m n m other other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles total other income expense n m n m income before income tax provision income tax provision net income less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests n m n m net income attributable to legg mason  inc n m not meaningful calculated based on the change in actual amounts between fiscal years as a percentage of the prior year amount 
fiscal compared with fiscal financial overview net income attributable to legg mason  inc for the year ended march   totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
the decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with western asset management company western asset  the impact of net market losses on proprietary fund products and assets invested for deferred compensation plans which are not offset in compensation and benefits  and the net impact of decreased operating revenues 
these decreases were offset in part by the impact of cost savings due to our business streamlining initiative  and the impact of tax benefits associated with the restructuring of a foreign subsidiary and uk tax rate changes 
these items are further discussed in results of operations below 
adjusted income see supplemental non gaap financial information decreased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended march   from million  or per diluted share  in the prior year primarily due to the decrease in net income  previously discussed  excluding the impact of uk tax rate adjustments

includes impact of foreign exchange  reinvestment of dividends  and other 
aum at march   was billion  a decrease of billion  or  from march  the decrease in aum was attributable to net client outflows of billion and dispositions of billion  which were partially offset by market performance and other of billion  including the negative impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
the majority of dispositions were in liquidity assets  billion  which resulted from the amendment of historical smith barney brokerage programs discussed below 
there were also billion in dispositions from the divestiture of two small affiliates 
long term asset classes accounted for the net client outflows  with billion and billion in equity and fixed income outflows  respectively  partially offset by liquidity inflows of billion 
equity outflows were primarily experienced by products managed at legg mason capital management  inc lmcm  clearbridge advisors llc clearbridge  batterymarch financial management  inc batterymarch and royce associates royce 
due in part to investment performance issues  we have experienced net annual outflows in our equity asset class since fiscal the majority of fixed income outflows were in products managed by western asset  including billion in outflows from a single  low fee global sovereign mandate 
we expect to continue to experience outflows from this mandate of approximately billion per month during fiscal with the exception of the june quarter  we have experienced outflows in our fixed income asset class since fiscal we generally earn higher fees and profits on equity aum  and outflows in this asset class will more negatively impact our revenues and net income than would outflows in other asset classes 
during the first quarter of fiscal  morgan stanley smith barney mssb amended certain historical smith barney brokerage programs providing for investment in liquidity funds that our asset managers manage that resulted in a reduction of billion in liquidity aum during the year ended march  as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition  the disposition of this liquidity aum resulted in a reduction in operating revenue of million  net of related fee waivers  in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  the disposition of this aum also resulted in reductions in distribution and servicing expenses of million in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  we expect the amendments to result in an additional billion in liquidity assets being transferred over the next four months 
our investment advisory and administrative contracts are generally terminable at will or upon relatively short notice  and investors in the mutual funds that we manage may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without prior notice 
institutional and individual clients can terminate their relationships with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  changes in our reputation in the marketplace  changes in management or control of clients or third party distributors with whom we have relationships  loss of key investment management personnel or financial market performance

business model streamlining initiative in may  we announced an initiative to streamline our business model to drive increased profitability and growth that primarily involved transitioning certain shared services to our investment affiliates which are closer to the actual client relationships 
the initiative resulted in over million in cost savings  which will be fully realized on an annual basis  beginning in fiscal these cost savings consist of i over million in compensation and benefits cost reductions from eliminating positions in certain corporate shared services functions as a result of transitioning such functions to the affiliates  and charging affiliates for other centralized services that will continue to be provided to them without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements  ii approximately million in non compensation costs from eliminating and streamlining activities in our corporate and distribution business units  including savings associated with consolidating office space  and iii approximately million from our global distribution group sharing in affiliate revenues from retail assets under management without any corresponding adjustment in revenue sharing or other compensation arrangements 
the initiative involved million in transition related costs that primarily included charges for employee termination benefits and incentives to retain employees during the transition period 
the transition related costs also included charges for consolidating leased office space  early contract terminations  accelerated depreciation of fixed assets  asset disposals and professional fees 
during the years ended march  and  transition related costs totaled million and million  respectively 
all transition related costs have been accrued as of march  significant events of fiscal related to the initiative included the transition of shared services to our affiliates  as well as reductions in force made over three phases 
for the year ended march   we have achieved total estimated transition related savings of approximately million  and we expect total annual savings of approximately million beginning in fiscal  when compared to similar expenses prior to the commencement of the streamlining initiative 
a majority of the estimated transition related savings were first achieved in fiscal  and are noted  where applicable  in the results of operations discussion to follow 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our business streamlining initiative 
results of operations in accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation  we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles  the most significant of which is a collateralized loan obligation entity clo 
the consolidation of these investment vehicles has no impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc and does not have a material impact on our consolidated operating results 
we also hold investments in certain consolidated sponsored investment funds and the change in the value of these investments  which is recorded in other non operating income expense  is reflected in our net income  net of amounts allocated to noncontrolling interests

operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march   were billion  a decrease of from billion in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in average aum and a million decrease in performance fees 
this decrease was offset in part by an increase in average aum revenue yields  from basis points in the year ended march   to basis points in the year ended march   resulting from a more favorable average asset mix 
the previously discussed disposition of liquidity aum related to the mssb relationship resulted in a reduction in operating revenues of million  net of related fee waivers  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a significant portion of the management fees generated by these assets were being waived prior to the disposition 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts decreased million  or  to million 
of this decrease  million was primarily the result of lower average equity assets managed by lmcm  batterymarch  clearbridge and legg mason investment counsel trust company lmic  and million was primarily due to the divestiture of a singapore based asset manager in fiscal these decreases were offset in part by an increase of million due to higher average fixed income assets managed by brandywine global management  llc brandywine 
investment advisory fees from funds remained essentially flat at billion for both periods 
higher average equity assets managed by royce and clearbridge  and higher average fixed income assets  primarily managed at western asset  resulted in an increase of million and million  respectively 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million  net of related fee waivers  due to lower average liquidity assets managed at western asset  primarily as a result of the previously discussed disposition of liquidity aum related to our mssb relationship  as well as a million decrease as a result of lower average equity assets managed by lmcm and permal group  ltd

operating expenses total compensation and benefits decreased million to billion 
transition related compensation decreased million to million  and represents accruals for severance and retention costs related to our business streamlining initiative 
compensation and benefits  excluding transition related compensation  decreased million  or  to billion  primarily driven by a million decrease in corporate compensation  primarily due to headcount reductions resulting from our business streamlining initiative  as well as a million net decrease in compensation at revenue share based affiliates 
additionally  there was a decrease in deferred compensation and revenue share based incentive obligations of million  primarily resulting from reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments  which are offset by corresponding decreases in other non operating income expense 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in incentives from changes in an expense reimbursement arrangement with western asset  including an increase in non cash amortization expense associated with certain related deferred compensation awards  totaling million  as well as additional costs of approximately million associated with market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees  primarily in our global distribution group  to support on going growth initiatives 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the impact of the change in the expense reimbursement arrangement with western asset and market based compensation increases among retained staff and new employees  discussed above 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of lower corporate compensation costs  primarily attributable to our business streamlining initiative  the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments  and the decrease in transition related compensation 
distribution and servicing expenses decreased to million  principally driven by a million decrease due to the previously discussed disposition of liquidity aum related to the mssb relationship  as well as a million decrease in servicing expenses as a result of our business streamlining initiative 
a million decline in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches also contributed to the decrease 
communications and technology expense increased to million  driven by increases  principally in data processing costs  market data costs  and consulting fees  totaling million  primarily due to transition related costs incurred as a result of our business streamlining initiative

in addition  there was a million increase as a result of the acceleration of depreciation related to space permanently abandoned in fiscal  also related to our business streamlining initiative 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of the write off of a million real estate escrow deposit in the prior year and a million reduction in depreciation on furniture and leasehold improvements  both resulting from our business streamlining initiative

non operating income expense interest income increased to million  driven by higher yields earned on investment balances 
interest expense decreased to million  primarily as a result of the retirement of our equity units during fiscal  which reduced interest expense by million 
other non operating income decreased million to million  primarily as a result of million in net market losses on investments in proprietary fund products  which were partially offset by corresponding compensation decreases discussed above  and million due to reduced gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which were substantially offset by corresponding compensation decreases described above 
these decreases were offset in part by an million increase in dividend income  which was partially offset by a corresponding compensation increase under revenue sharing agreements  a gain of million related to an assigned bankruptcy claim  and a gain of million on the sale of a small affiliate 
other non operating income of consolidated investment vehicles civs increased million to million  due to net market gains on investments of certain civs 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million compared to million in the prior year

supplemental non gaap financial information as supplemental information  we are providing performance measures that are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles non gaap for consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles  adjusted income  and operating margin  as adjusted that management uses as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period to period operating performance 
consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles in accordance with financial accounting standards on consolidation  we consolidate and separately identify certain sponsored investment vehicles  the most significant of which is a clo 
in presenting our consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles  we add back the investment advisory and distribution and servicing fees that are eliminated upon the consolidation of investment vehicles and exclude the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income expense and noncontrolling interests of civs 
we believe it is important to provide the consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles to present the underlying economic performance of our core asset management operations  which does not include the results of the investment funds that we manage but may not own all of the equity invested 
by deconsolidating the civs from the consolidated statements of income  the investment advisory and distribution fees we earn from civs are added back to reflect our actual revenues 
similarly  the operating expenses and the impact on non operating income expense and noncontrolling interests of civs are removed from the gaap basis consolidated statements of income since this activity does not actually belong to us 
the deconsolidation of the investment vehicles does not have any impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc in any period presented 
the consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles are presented in addition to our gaap basis consolidated statements of income  but are not substitutes for the gaap basis consolidated statements of income and may not be comparable to consolidated statements of income presented on a non gaap basis of other companies 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated statements of income presented on a gaap basis to our consolidated statements of income  excluding consolidated investment vehicles for the years ended march  and in thousands for the years ended march  gaap basis civs non gaap basis excluding civs gaap basis civs non gaap basis excluding civs total operating revenues total operating expenses operating income other non operating income expense income loss before income tax provision income tax provision net income loss less net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to legg mason  inc adjusted income we define adjusted income as net income attributable to legg mason  inc  plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets and goodwill  and imputed interest and tax benefits on contingent convertible debt less deferred income taxes on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment  if any 
we also adjust for non core items that are not reflective of our economic performance  such as the impact of tax rate adjustments on certain deferred tax liabilities related to indefinite life intangible assets  and net money market fund support losses gains 
we believe that adjusted income provides a useful representation of our operating performance adjusted for non cash acquisition related items and other items that facilitate comparison of our results to the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt  made significant acquisitions  or engaged in money market fund support transactions 
we also believe that adjusted income is an important metric in estimating the value of an asset management business 
adjusted income only considers adjustments for certain items that relate to operating performance and comparability  and therefore  is most readily reconcilable to net income attributable to legg mason  inc determined under gaap 
this measure is provided in addition to net income attributable to legg mason  inc  but is not a substitute for net income attributable to legg mason  inc and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted earnings or adjusted income  of other companies 
further  adjusted income is not a liquidity measure and should not be used in place of cash flow measures determined under gaap 
we consider adjusted income to be useful to investors because it is an important metric in measuring the economic performance of asset management companies  as an indicator of value  and because it facilitates comparison of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not issued contingent convertible debt  engaged in significant acquisitions  or engaged in money market fund support transactions 
in calculating adjusted income  we add the impact of the amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions  such as management contracts  to net income attributable to legg mason  inc to reflect the fact that these non cash expenses distort comparisons of our operating results with the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions 
deferred taxes on indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill include actual tax benefits from amortization deductions that are not realized under gaap absent an impairment charge or the disposition of the related business 
because we fully expect to realize the economic benefit of the current period tax amortization  we add this benefit to net income attributable to legg mason  inc in the calculation of adjusted income 
however  because of our net operating loss carryforward  we will receive the benefit of the current tax amortization over time 
conversely  we subtract the non cash income tax benefits on goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset impairment charges and united kingdom tax rate adjustments on excess book basis on certain acquired indefinite life intangible assets  if applicable  that have been recognized under gaap 
we also add back imputed interest on contingent convertible debt  which is a non cash expense  as well as the actual tax benefits on the related contingent convertible debt that are not realized under gaap 
we also add subtract other non core items  such as net money market fund support losses gains net of losses on the sale of the underlying structured investment vehicle siv securities  if applicable 
these adjustments reflect that these items distort comparisons of our operating results to prior periods and the results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in money market fund support transactions or significant acquisitions  including any related impairments 
should a disposition  impairment charge or other non core item occur  its impact on adjusted income may distort actual changes in the operating performance or value of our firm 
also  realized losses on money market fund support transactions are reflective of changes in the operating performance and value of our firm 
accordingly  we monitor these items and their related impact  including taxes  on adjusted income to ensure that appropriate adjustments and explanations accompany such disclosures 
although depreciation and amortization of fixed assets are non cash expenses  we do not add these charges in calculating adjusted income because these charges are related to assets that will ultimately require replacement 
a reconciliation of net income attributable to legg mason  inc to adjusted income in thousands except per share amounts is as follows for the years ended march  net income attributable to legg mason  inc plus less amortization of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets tax amortization benefit uk tax rate adjustment imputed interest on convertible debt adjusted income net income per diluted share attributable to legg mason  inc common shareholders plus less amortization of intangible assets deferred income taxes on intangible assets tax amortization benefit uk tax rate adjustment imputed interest on convertible debt adjusted income per diluted share operating margin  as adjusted we calculate operating margin  as adjusted  by dividing i operating income  adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans  the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements  transition related costs of streamlining our business model  income loss of civs  and impairment charges by ii our operating revenues  adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles  less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties  which we refer to as operating revenues  as adjusted 
the compensation items  other than transition related costs  are removed from operating income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in other non operating income expense  and thus have no impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc transition related costs and income loss of civs are removed from operating income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations 
we use operating revenues  as adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses  which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period 
operating revenues  as adjusted  also include our advisory revenues we receive from civs that are eliminated in consolidation under gaap 
we believe that operating margin  as adjusted  is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities excluding items that have no impact on net income attributable to legg mason  inc and because it indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products  transition related costs  and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above 
the consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact to net income attributable to legg mason  inc this measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under gaap  but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under gaap and may not be comparable to non gaap performance measures  including measures of adjusted margins of other companies 
the calculation of operating margin and operating margin  as adjusted  is as follows dollars in thousands for the years ended march  operating revenues  gaap basis plus less operating revenues eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles distribution and servicing expense excluding consolidated investment vehicles operating revenues  as adjusted operating income  gaap basis plus less gains losses on deferred compensation and seed investments transition related costs operating income and expenses of consolidated investment vehicles operating income  as adjusted operating margin  gaap basis operating margin  as adjusted fiscal compared with fiscal financial overview net income attributable to legg mason  inc for the year ended march   totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
the increase in net income was primarily due to the net impact of increased operating revenues  reflecting a more favorable asset mix and increased performance fees  reduced interest expense  and a change in the uk tax rate 
these increases were offset in part by the impact of transition related compensation  the impact of gains on fund support recognized in the prior year  and an increase in costs associated with closed end fund launches 
these items are further discussed in results of operations below 
adjusted income see supplemental non gaap financial information was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in net income  as previously discussed  excluding the impact of the current year uk tax rate change and fund support gains in the prior year

the equity markets worked through a difficult year with political upheaval in the middle east late in the fiscal year driving a significant increase in oil prices and the earthquake in japan and subsequent nuclear crisis raising questions about the future of the nuclear power industry 
despite these global concerns  most us indices produced positive returns for our full fiscal year driven by corporate earnings growth resulting in increases in dividends  share buybacks  and mergers and acquisitions activity 
in the fixed income markets  relatively strong economic data  combined with continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy  continued to alleviate fears of a double dip recession and caused us treasury yields to rise across the yield curve 
the yield curve slightly flattened over the year as the federal reserve kept its funds rate at and reiterated that rates would be kept low for an extended period 
the worst performing fixed income sector for the year was government bonds as measured by the barclays us government bond index returning  in contrast to high yield bonds  as measured by the barclays high yield bond index  which returned followed by us tips  as measured by the barclays us tips index  which returned for the year

results of operations operating revenues total operating revenues for the year ended march   were billion  an increase of from billion in the prior year  despite a decrease in average aum  reflecting increased revenue yields due to a more favorable asset mix and higher performance fees 
these increases were offset in part by an increase in fee waivers on certain liquidity funds in order to maintain certain yields to investors 
investment advisory fees from separate accounts were relatively flat at million  as a decrease of million  resulting from lower average fixed income assets at western asset  was offset by an million increase due to higher average equity assets managed by batterymarch and royce  a million increase due to higher average fixed income assets managed by brandywine  and a million increase due to subordinate fees received from certain clos managed by western asset 
investment advisory fees from funds increased million  or  to billion 
of this increase  million was the result of higher average equity assets managed at royce  permal  and clearbridge  and million was the result of higher average fixed income assets managed at western asset

operating expenses total compensation and benefits increased million to billion 
compensation and benefits  excluding transition related compensation of million  which represents severance and retention incentive costs  increased million  or  to billion 
this increase was driven by a million increase in revenue share based compensation resulting from higher revenues and a reduction in operating expenses at revenue share based affiliates in fiscal  and a million increase in incentive compensation for non revenue share based affiliates and administrative and sales personnel 
these increases were offset in part by a million reduction in deferred compensation obligations due to the impact of reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans  which are recorded in other non operating income expense  as well as  a million reduction in deferred compensation expense at non revenue share based affiliates 
the impact of reduced headcount  primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives  also reduced compensation and benefits by million 
compensation as a percentage of operating revenues increased to from in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of increased revenues at revenue share based affiliates that retain a higher percentage of revenues as compensation  and transition related compensation 
these increases were substantially offset by the impact of compensation decreases related to reduced market gains on assets invested for deferred compensation plans and seed capital investments and the impact of lower corporate compensation on increased revenues 
distribution and servicing expenses increased to million  primarily as a result of an increase in average aum in certain products for which we pay fees to third party distributors and an increase of million in structuring fees related to closed end fund launches offset in part by the impact of liquidity fund fee waivers that reduce the amounts paid to our distributors 
communications and technology expense decreased to million  of which million resulted from the full depreciation of certain assets prior to or during fiscal  offset in part by a million increase in technology consulting and outsourcing fees  primarily related to our business streamlining initiatives

these decreases were offset in part by the impact of million in charges related to the exchange of our equity units in the prior year 
other non operating income expense of civs decreased million  to a gain of million  due to losses associated with an increase in fair value of the debt related to a civ 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million compared to million in the prior year

in march  we repaid million of the outstanding borrowings under this credit facility 
the facility may be prepaid at any time and contains customary covenants and default provisions 
the facility matures on february  in october  we borrowed million through a syndicated five year unsecured floating rate term loan agreement to primarily fund the cash portion of the purchase price of the citigroup transaction 
during fiscal  we repaid the remaining million outstanding balance of the debt 
the agreements entered into as part of our january issuance of billion in convertible senior notes prevent us from incurring additional debt  with a few exceptions  if our gross debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the documents exceeds to as of march   our gross debt to ebitda ratio was to  and thus the covenant prohibits us from borrowing additional amounts as of that date 
the convertible senior notes were extinguished in may  as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the financial covenants under our bank agreements include maximum net debt to ebitda ratio of to and minimum ebitda to interest expense ratio of to debt is defined to include all obligations for borrowed money  excluding non recourse debt  and under capital leases 
under these net debt covenants  our debt is reduced by the amount of our unrestricted cash in excess of the greater of subsidiary cash or million 
ebitda is defined as consolidated net income plus minus tax expense  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  amortization of intangibles  any extraordinary expenses or losses  and any non cash charges  as defined 
as of march   our net debt to ebitda ratio was to and ebitda to interest expense ratio was to we have maintained compliance with our covenants at all times during fiscal if our net income significantly declines  or if we spend our available cash  it may impact our ability to maintain compliance with these covenants 
if we determine that our compliance with these covenants may be under pressure  we may elect to take a number of actions  including reducing our expenses in order to increase our ebitda  using available cash to repay all or a portion of our million outstanding debt subject to these covenants or seeking to negotiate with our lenders to modify the terms or to restructure our debt 
we anticipate that we will have available cash to repay our bank debt  should it be necessary 
using available cash to repay indebtedness would make the cash unavailable for other uses and might affect the liquidity discussions and conclusions above 
entering into any modification or restructuring of our debt would likely result in additional fees or interest payments 
certain of our outstanding debt is currently impacted by the ratings of two rating agencies 
the interest rate on our revolving line of credit is based on the higher credit rating of the two rating agencies 
in june  our rating by one of these agencies was downgraded one notch below the other 
should the other agency downgrade our rating  absent an upgrade from the former agency  our interest costs will rise modestly 
other transactions during fiscal  in connection with the acquisition of permal  we paid an aggregate of million in cash to acquire the remaining of the outstanding preference shares issued by permal and held by permal s pre acquisition owners 
we also elected to purchase  for million  the rights of the sellers of the preference shares to receive an earnout payment of up to million in two years 
as a result of this transaction  there will be no further payments for the permal acquisition 
in addition  during fiscal  we paid an aggregate amount of million in dividends on the preference shares 
all payments for preference shares  including dividends  were recognized as additional goodwill 
in may  we terminated the exchangeable share arrangement related to the acquisition of legg mason canada inc  in accordance with its terms 
in this transaction  million shares  representing all remaining outstanding exchangeable shares  were exchanged for shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
certain of our asset management affiliates maintain various credit facilities for general operating purposes 
certain affiliates are also subject to the capital requirements of various regulatory agencies 
all such affiliates met their respective capital adequacy requirements during the periods presented 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our financing transactions 
liquidity fund support during fiscal  four capital support agreements to provide up to million in support to two liquidity funds were terminated or expired in accordance with their terms 
no amounts were drawn thereunder prior to termination and million of collateral was returned 
future outlook we expect that over the next months our operating activities will be adequate to support our operating cash needs 
we currently intend to utilize our other available resources for any number of potential activities  including seed capital investments in new products  repurchase of shares of our common stock  repayment of outstanding debt  payment of increased dividends  or acquisitions 
during fiscal  we completed the business model streamlining initiative that began in may we incurred transition related costs of approximately million through march   of which approximately were non cash charges 
approximately million of these costs have been paid to date  and substantially all of the million remaining costs represent lease obligations to be paid over the lease terms 
the initiative resulted in annual cost savings of over million  which will be fully realized on an annual basis  beginning in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding transition related costs recorded in fiscal and as described above  we currently project that our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs 
as of march   we had over billion in cash and cash equivalents in excess of our working capital requirements  a portion of which we intend to utilize to repurchase up to million of our common stock during fiscal  as previously discussed 
we do not currently expect to raise additional debt or equity financing over the next months  other than to refinance existing facilities 
however  there can be no assurances of these expectations as our projections could prove to be incorrect  events may occur that require additional liquidity  such as an acquisition opportunity or an opportunity to refinance indebtedness  or market conditions might significantly worsen  affecting our results of operations and generation of available cash 
if these events result in our operations and available cash being insufficient to fund liquidity needs  we would likely seek to manage our available resources by taking actions such as reducing future share repurchases  additional cost cutting  reducing our expected expenditures on investments  selling assets such as investment securities  repatriating earnings from foreign affiliates  or modifying arrangements with our affiliates and or employees 
should these types of actions prove insufficient  or should a large acquisition or refinancing opportunity arise  we may seek to raise additional equity or debt 
at march   our total cash and cash equivalents of billion included million held by foreign subsidiaries 
some of the amounts held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to material repatriation tax effects 
in a prior year  we initiated plans to repatriate accumulated earnings of approximately million  of which approximately million had been repatriated as of march  under current plans  we intend to repatriate million to million of foreign earnings in order to utilize foreign tax credits that may otherwise expire unutilized and to make the cash available in the us all amounts planned for repatriation have been adequately provided for 
no further repatriation of accumulated prior period foreign earnings beyond the above range is currently planned 
however  we may repatriate future earnings to the extent required to fund domestic operations and  if tax has not previously been provided  we would provide for and pay additional us taxes in connection with repatriation of these funds 
it is not practical at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result from any further repatriation of foreign earnings beyond that currently planned 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for subsequent events related to our new capital plan  including million issuance of senior notes and billion repayment of convertible senior notes 
credit and liquidity risk cash and cash equivalent deposits involve certain credit and liquidity risks 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents with a limited number of high quality financial institutions and from time to time may have concentrations with one or more of these institutions 
the balances with these financial institutions and their credit quality are monitored on an ongoing basis 
off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by the securities and exchange commission sec  include certain contractual arrangements pursuant to which a company has an obligation  such as certain contingent obligations  certain guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity  certain derivative instruments classified as equity or material variable interests in unconsolidated entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support 
disclosure is required for any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
we generally do not enter into off balance sheet arrangements  as defined  other than those described in the contractual obligations section that follows and consolidation discussed in critical accounting policies and notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  we entered into hedge and warrant transactions on the convertible notes with certain financial institution counterparties to increase the effective conversion price of the convertible senior notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and contingent payments we have contractual obligations to make future payments  principally in connection with our short and long term debt  non cancelable lease agreements  and service agreements 
see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our commitments 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations in millions by fiscal year  and excludes contractual obligations of civs  as we are not responsible or liable for these obligations thereafter total contractual obligations short term borrowings long term borrowings by contract maturity interest on short term and long term borrowings minimum rental and service commitments total contractual obligations represents borrowing under our revolving line of credit which does not expire until february however  we may elect to repay this debt sooner if management elects to utilize a portion of our available cash for this purpose 
excludes long term borrowings of the consolidated clo of million and interest on these long term borrowings  as applicable 
interest on floating rate short term debt is based on rates at march  the table above does not include approximately million in capital commitments to investment partnerships in which legg mason is a limited partner 
these obligations will be funded  as required  through the end of the commitment periods through fiscal the table above does not include amounts for uncertain tax positions of million net of the federal benefit for state tax liabilities  because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 
the table above does not include redeemable noncontrolling interests of million  because the timing of any related cash outflows cannot be reliably estimated 
market risk we maintain an enterprise risk management program to oversee and coordinate risk management activities of legg mason and its subsidiaries 
under the program  certain risk activities are managed at the subsidiary level 
the following describes certain aspects of our business that are sensitive to market risk 
revenues and net income the majority of our revenue is calculated from the market value of our aum 
accordingly  a decline in the value of securities will cause our aum  and thus our revenues  to decrease 
in addition  our fixed income and liquidity aum are subject to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  as rising interest rates may tend to reduce the market value of bonds held in various mutual fund portfolios or separately managed accounts 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may also reduce or waive investment management fees  or limit total expenses  on certain products or services for particular time periods to manage fund expenses  or for other reasons  and to help retain or increase managed assets 
performance fees may be earned on certain investment advisory contracts for exceeding performance benchmarks 
declines in market values of aum will result in reduced fee revenues and net income 
we generally earn higher fees on equity assets than fees charged for fixed income and liquidity assets 
declines in market values of aum in this asset class will disproportionately impact our revenues 
in addition  under revenue sharing agreements  certain of our affiliates retain different percentages of revenues to cover their costs  including compensation 
our net income  profit margin and compensation as a percentage of operating revenues are impacted based on which affiliates generate our revenues  and a change in aum at one subsidiary can have a dramatically different effect on our revenues and earnings than an equal change at another subsidiary 
trading and non trading assets our trading and non trading assets are comprised of investment securities  including seed capital in sponsored mutual funds and products  limited partnerships  limited liability companies and certain other investment products 
trading and other current investments  excluding civs  at march  and  subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities  excluding civs trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans trading proprietary fund products and other investments equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans  proprietary fund products and other investments total current investments  excluding civs approximately million and million of trading and other current investments related to long term incentive compensation plans as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting liabilities such that fluctuation in the market value of these assets and the related liabilities will not have a material effect on our net income or liquidity 
however  it will have an impact on our compensation expense with a corresponding offset in other non operating income expense 
trading and other current investments of million and million at march  and  respectively  relate to other long term incentive plans for which the related liabilities do not completely offset due to vesting provisions 
therefore  fluctuations in the market value of these trading investments will impact our compensation expense  non operating income expense and net income 
approximately million and million of trading and other current investments at march  and  respectively  are investments in proprietary fund products and other investments for which fluctuations in market value will impact our non operating income 
of these amounts  the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million of proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  have offsetting compensation expense under revenue share agreements 
the fluctuations in market value of approximately million and million in proprietary fund products as of march  and  respectively  are substantially offset by gains losses on market hedges and therefore do not materially impact net income attributable to legg mason  inc investments in proprietary fund products are not liquidated until the related fund establishes a track record  has other investors  or a decision is made to no longer pursue the strategy 
non trading assets  excluding civs  at march  and  subject to risk of security price fluctuations are summarized in thousands below 
investment securities  excluding civs available for sale investments in partnerships  llcs and other equity method investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total non trading assets  excluding civs equity method investments in partnerships and llcs at march  and  includes approximately million and million  respectively  of investments related to our involvement with the us treasury s public private investment program 
fluctuations in the market value of these investments have offsetting compensation expense under revenue sharing agreements 
investment securities of civs totaled million and million as of march  and  respectively  and investments of civs totaled million and million as of march  and  respectively 
as of march  and  we held equity investments in the civs of million and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the market value of investments of civs in excess of our equity investment will not impact net income attributable to legg mason  inc however  it may have an impact on other non operating income expense of civs with a corresponding offset in net income loss attributable to non controlling interests 
valuation of trading and non trading investments is described below within critical accounting policies under the heading valuation of financial instruments 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivatives 
the following is a summary of the effect of a increase or decrease in the market values of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks at march  carrying value fair value assuming a increase fair value assuming a decrease investment securities  excluding civs trading investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans trading proprietary fund products and other investments equity method investments relating to long term incentive compensation plans  proprietary fund products and other investments total current investments  excluding civs investments in civs available for sale investments investments in partnerships  llcs and other equity method investments in partnerships and llcs other investments total investments subject to market risk gains and losses related to certain investments in deferred compensation plans and proprietary fund products are directly offset by a corresponding adjustment to compensation expense and related liability 
in addition  investments in proprietary fund products of approximately million have been economically hedged to limit market risk 
as a result  a increase or decrease in the unrealized market value of our financial instruments subject to market valuation risks would result in a million increase or decrease in our pre tax earnings as of march  foreign exchange sensitivity we operate primarily in the united states  but provide services  earn revenues and incur expenses outside the united states 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for currencies  principally in brazil  poland  australia  canada and the united kingdom may impact our comprehensive income and net income 
certain of our affiliates have entered into forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on their results of operations 
we do not expect foreign currency fluctuations to have a material effect on our net income or liquidity 
interest rate risk exposure to interest rate changes on our outstanding debt is mitigated as substantially all of our debt is at fixed interest rates 
at march  and  approximately million of our outstanding floating rate debt is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and will have an impact on our non operating income and net income 
as of march   we estimate that a change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense of million 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies are an integral part of the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
understanding these policies  therefore  is a key factor in understanding our reported results of operations and financial position 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies and other information 
certain critical accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
therefore  actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies that involve significant estimates or judgments 
consolidation effective april   we adopted revised accounting guidance  accounting standards codification asc topic  consolidation  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendments to financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r sfas no 
 relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities vies which includes a new approach for determining who should consolidate a vie  changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a vie  and changes in the assessment of which entities are vies 
the application of the revised accounting guidance has been deferred for certain investment funds  including money market funds 
investment funds that qualify for the deferral continue to be assessed for consolidation under prior guidance  financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
in the normal course of our business  we sponsor and are the manager of various types of investment vehicles 
certain of these investment vehicles are considered to be vies while others are considered to be voting rights entities vres subject to traditional consolidation concepts based on ownership rights 
for our services  we are entitled to receive management fees and may be eligible  under certain circumstances  to receive additional subordinate management fees or other incentive fees 
our exposure to risk in these entities is generally limited to any equity investment we have made or are required to make and any earned but uncollected management fees 
uncollected management fees from these vies were not material at march  we have not issued any investment performance guarantees to these vies  vres or their investors 
investment vehicles that are considered vres are consolidated if we have a controlling financial interest in the investment vehicle 
financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r accounting standards update  amendments to statement for certain investment funds for most sponsored investment funds  including money market funds  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  or receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  if any 
our determination of expected residual returns excludes gross fees paid to a decision maker if certain criteria are met 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors such as the voting rights of the equity holders  economic participation of all parties  including how fees are earned and paid to us  related party ownership  guarantees and implied relationships 
in determining the primary beneficiary  we must make assumptions and estimates about  among other things  the future performance of the underlying assets held by the vie  including investment returns  cash flows  and credit and interest rate risks 
in determining whether a vie is significant for disclosure purposes  we consider the same factors used for determination of the primary beneficiary 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting standards codification topic  consolidation we sponsor and are the manager for collateralized debt obligation entities cdos and clos that do not qualify for the deferral  and are assessed under the revised accounting guidance  as follows 
we determine whether we have a variable interest in a vie by considering if  among other things  we have the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that are expected to be significant to the vie 
we consider the management fee structure  including the seniority level of our fees  the current and expected economic performance of the entity  as well as other provisions included in the governing documents that might restrict or guarantee an expected loss or residual return 
if we have a significant variable interest  we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie if we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that potentially could be significant to the vie 
in evaluating whether we have the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  that could potentially be significant to the vie  we consider factors regarding the design  terms  and characteristics of the investment vehicles  including the following qualitative factors if we have involvement with the investment vehicle beyond providing management services  if we hold equity or debt interests in the investment vehicle  if we have transferred any assets to the investment vehicle  if the potential aggregate fees in future periods are insignificant relative to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle  and if the variability of the expected fees in relation to the potential cash flows of the investment vehicle is more than insignificant 
legg mason must consolidate vies for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of civs and other vies 
revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenues are calculated as a percentage of the fair value of our aum 
the underlying securities within the portfolios we manage  which are not reflected within our consolidated financial statements  are generally valued as follows i with respect to securities for which market quotations are readily available  the market value of such securities  and ii with respect to other securities and assets  fair value as determined in good faith 
for most of our mutual funds and other pooled products  the boards of directors or similar bodies are responsible for establishing policies and procedures related to the pricing of securities 
each board of directors generally delegates the execution of the various functions related to pricing to a fund valuation committee which  in turn  may rely on information from various parties in pricing securities such as independent pricing services  the fund accounting agent  the fund manager  broker dealers  and others or a combination thereof 
the funds have controls reasonably designed to ensure that the prices assigned to securities they hold are accurate 
management has established policies to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
as manager and advisor for separate accounts  we are generally responsible for the pricing of securities held in client accounts or may share this responsibility with others and have established policies to govern valuation processes similar to those discussed above for mutual funds that are reasonably designed to ensure consistency in the application of revenue recognition 
management relies extensively on the data provided by independent pricing services and the custodians in the pricing of separate account aum 
separate account customers typically select the custodian 
valuation processes for aum are dependent on the nature of the assets and any contractual provisions with our clients 
equity securities under management for which market quotations are available are usually valued at the last reported sales price or official closing price on the primary market or exchange on which they trade 
debt securities under management are usually valued at bid  or the mean between the last quoted bid and asked prices  provided by independent pricing services that are based on transactions in debt obligations  quotations from bond dealers  market transactions in comparable securities and various other relationships between securities 
short term debt obligations are generally valued at amortized cost  which is designed to approximate fair value 
the vast majority of our aum is valued based on data from third parties such as independent pricing services  fund accounting agents  custodians and brokers 
this varies slightly from time to time based upon the underlying composition of the asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity as well as the actual underlying securities in the portfolio within each asset class 
regardless of the valuation process or pricing source  we have established controls reasonably designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
where market prices are not readily available  or are determined not to reflect fair value  value may be determined in accordance with established valuation procedures based on  among other things  unobservable inputs 
management fees on aum where fair values are based on unobservable inputs are not material 
as of march   equity  fixed income and liquidity aum values aggregated billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as the vast majority of our aum is valued by independent pricing services based upon observable market prices or inputs  we believe market risk is the most significant risk underlying valuation of our aum 
economic events and financial market turmoil have increased market price volatility  however  the valuation of the vast majority of the securities held by our funds and in separate accounts continues to be derived from readily available market price quotations 
as of march   less than of total aum is valued based on unobservable inputs 
valuation of financial instruments substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  except our long term debt 
trading investments  investment securities and derivative assets and liabilities included in the consolidated balance sheets include forms of financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
for equity investments where we do not control the investee  and where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  but can exert significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the investee  we follow the equity method of accounting 
the evaluation of whether we exert control or significant influence over the financial and operational policies of its investees requires significant judgment based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each individual investment 
factors considered in these evaluations may include investor voting or other rights  any influence we may have on the governing board of the investee  the legal rights of other investors in the entity pursuant to the fund s operating documents and the relationship between us and other investors in the entity 
substantially all of our equity method investees are investment companies which record their underlying investments at fair value 
therefore  under the equity method of accounting  our share of the investee s underlying net income or loss predominantly represents fair value adjustments in the investments held by the equity method investee 
our share of the investee s net income or loss is based on the most current information available and is recorded as a net gain loss on investments within non operating income expense 
for investments  we value equity and fixed income securities using closing market prices for listed instruments or broker or dealer price quotations  when available 
fixed income securities may also be valued using valuation models and estimates based on spreads to actively traded benchmark debt instruments with readily available market prices 
we evaluate our non trading investment securities for other than temporary impairment 
impairment may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the adjusted cost for an extended period of time 
if an other than temporary impairment is determined to exist  the difference between the adjusted cost of the investment security and its current fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities for which market prices or quotations are not readily available  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry 
as of march  and  excluding investments in civs  we owned approximately million and million  respectively  of financial investments that were valued on our assumptions or estimates and unobservable inputs 
at march  and  we also have approximately million and million  respectively  of other investments  such as investment partnerships  that are included in other noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheets  of which approximately million and million  respectively  are accounted for under the equity method 
the remainder is accounted for under the cost method  which considers if factors indicate there may be an impairment in the value of these investments 
in addition  as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of equity method investments that are included in investment securities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value 
the accounting guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
a fair value measurement should reflect all of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique  the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset  and the risk of non performance 
the accounting guidance for fair value measurements establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
our financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories level financial instruments for which prices are quoted in active markets  which  for us  include investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and equities listed in active markets 
level financial instruments for which prices are quoted for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  prices are quoted for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or prices are based on observable inputs  other than quoted prices  such as models or other valuation methodologies 
for us  this category may include repurchase agreements  fixed income securities and certain proprietary fund products 
this category also includes clo loans and liabilities of a civ  and previously included certain derivative assets and liabilities of civs 
level financial instruments for which values are based on unobservable inputs  including those for which there is little or no market activity 
this category includes investments in partnerships  limited liability companies and private equity funds 
this category may also include certain proprietary fund products with redemption restrictions and clo debt of a civ 
the valuation of an asset or liability may involve inputs from more than one level of the hierarchy 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
proprietary fund products and certain investments held by civs are valued at net asset value nav determined by the fund administrator 
these funds are typically invested in exchange traded investments with observable market prices 
their valuations may be classified as level  level or level based on whether the fund is exchange traded  the frequency of the related nav determinations and the impact of redemption restrictions 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities private equity and investment partnerships for which market prices or quotations may not be readily available  including certain investments held by civs  management must estimate the value of the securities using a variety of methods and resources  including the most current available financial information for the investment and the industry to which it applies in order to determine fair value 
these valuation processes for illiquid and privately held securities inherently require management s judgment and are therefore classified in level the fair values of clo loans and bonds are determined based on prices from well recognized third party pricing services that utilize available market data and are therefore classified as level legg mason has established controls designed to assess the reasonableness of the prices provided 
the fair value of clo debt is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology 
inputs used to determine the expected cash flows include assumptions about forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the fair value of the clo s underlying collateral assets 
given the significance of the unobservable inputs to the fair value measurement  the clo debt valuation is classified as level exchange traded options are valued using the last sale price or in the absence of a sale  the last offering price 
options traded over the counter are valued using dealer supplied valuations 
options are classified as level futures contracts are valued at the last settlement price at the end of each day on the exchange upon which they are traded and are classified as level index and single name credit default swaps and interest rate swaps previously held were valued based on valuations furnished by pricing services and classified as level as a practical expedient  we rely on the navs of certain investments as their fair value 
the navs that have been provided by investees are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the reporting date 
as of march   approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and of total liabilities meet the definition of level excluding the assets and liabilities of civs  approximately of total assets of financial assets measured at fair value and no liabilities meet the definition of level any transfers between categories are measured at the beginning of the period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
intangible assets and goodwill balances as of march   are as follows amortizable asset management contracts indefinite life intangible assets trade names goodwill our identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of asset management contracts  contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds and trade names resulting from acquisitions 
asset management contracts are amortizable intangible assets that are capitalized at acquisition and amortized over the expected life of the contract 
contracts to manage proprietary mutual funds or funds of hedge funds are indefinite life intangible assets because we assume that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period due to the likelihood of continued renewal at little or no cost 
similarly  trade names are considered indefinite life intangible assets because they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquisition to intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
we determine fair values of intangible assets acquired based upon projected future cash flows  which take into consideration estimates and assumptions including profit margins  growth or attrition rates for acquired contracts based upon historical experience  estimated contract lives  discount rates  projected net client flows and market performance 
the determination of estimated contract lives requires judgment based upon historical client turnover and attrition rates and the probability that contracts with termination provisions will be renewed 
the discount rate employed is a weighted average cost of capital that takes into consideration a premium representing the degree of risk inherent in the asset as more fully described below 
for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill  we project the impact of both net client flows and market appreciation depreciation on cash flows for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our past experience  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  internal budgets  and discussions with our own market experts 
beyond five years  our projections for net client flows and market performance migrate towards relevant long term rates in line with our own results and industry growth statistics 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  there continues to be uncertainty in the markets  and our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
goodwill represents the residual amount of acquisition cost in excess of identified tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities 
given the relative significance of our intangible assets and goodwill to our consolidated financial statements  on a quarterly basis we consider if triggering events have occurred that may indicate a significant change in fair values 
triggering events may include significant adverse changes in our business  legal or regulatory environment  loss of key personnel  significant business dispositions  or other events 
if a triggering event has occurred  we perform tests  which include critical reviews of all significant assumptions  to determine if any intangible assets or goodwill are impaired 
at a minimum  we perform these tests for indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill annually at december we completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as of december   and determined that there was no impairment in the value of these assets as of that date 
further  no impairment in the value of amortizable intangible assets was recognized during the year ended march   as our estimates of the related future cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values 
we have also determined that no triggering events have occurred as of march   therefore  no additional indefinite life intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing was necessary 
amortizable intangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization are considered for impairment at each reporting period using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
significant assumptions used in assessing the recoverability of management contract intangible assets include projected cash flows generated by the contracts and the remaining lives of the contracts 
projected cash flows are based on fees generated by current aum for the applicable contracts 
contracts are generally assumed to turnover evenly throughout the life of the intangible asset 
the remaining life of the asset is based upon factors such as average client retention and client turnover rates 
if the amortization periods are not appropriate  the expected lives are adjusted and the impact on the fair value is assessed 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets currently range from one to five years with a weighted average life of approximately years 
indefinite life intangible assets for intangible assets with lives that are indeterminable or indefinite  fair value is determined from a market participant s perspective based on projected discounted cash flows 
we have two primary types of indefinite life intangible assets proprietary fund contracts and  to a lesser extent  trade names 
we determine the fair value of our intangible assets based upon discounted projected cash flows  which take into consideration estimates of profit margins  growth rates and discount rates 
an asset is determined to be impaired if the current implied fair value is less than the recorded carrying value of the asset 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the current implied fair value and the carrying value of the asset reflected on the financial statements is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
projected cash flows are based on annualized cash flows for the applicable contracts projected forward years  assuming annual cash flow growth from estimated net client flows and projected market performance 
contracts that are managed and operated as a single unit  such as contracts within the same family of funds  are reviewed in aggregate and are considered interchangeable because investors can transfer between funds with limited restrictions 
similarly  cash flows generated by new funds added to the fund group are included when determining the fair value of the intangible asset 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
the domestic mutual fund contracts acquired in the citigroup asset management cam acquisition of  million account for approximately of our indefinite life intangible assets and are managed primarily by clearbridge and western asset 
permal funds of hedge funds contracts of million account for approximately of our indefinite life intangible assets 
for our december   annual impairment test  cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 
cash flows on the permal funds of hedge funds contracts were assumed to have annual growth rates that average approximately 
the projected cash flows from the domestic mutual fund and permal funds were discounted at and  respectively 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions for the domestic mutual fund and permal funds of hedge funds contracts would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate more than and  respectively  from previous projections or the discount rate would have to be raised to and  respectively  for the asset to be deemed impaired 
given the current uncertainty regarding future market conditions  it is reasonably possible that fund performance  flows and aum levels may decrease in the near term such that actual cash flows from the domestic mutual fund contracts could deviate from the projections by more than and the asset could be deemed to be impaired by a material amount 
the approximate fair values of these assets exceed their carrying values by million and million  respectively 
trade names account for of indefinite life intangible assets and are primarily related to permal 
we tested these intangible assets using assumptions similar to those described above for indefinite life contracts  and the resulting fair values significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts 
goodwill goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and is considered for impairment when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
in estimating the implied fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted projected cash flows  similar to techniques employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
in december  we announced a realignment of our executive management team  which during fiscal  resulted in the combination of our americas and international divisions into one operating segment  global asset management 
internal management reporting has been modified consistent with this realignment such that discrete financial information regularly received by the chief operating decision maker  our chief executive officer  is at the consolidated global asset management business level 
as a result  the former americas and international operating segments are no longer our reporting units  and subsequently  goodwill is recorded and evaluated at one global asset management reporting unit level 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to business segments 
significant assumptions used in assessing the implied fair value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method include the projected cash flows generated by the reporting unit  including profit margins  expected cash flow growth rates  and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows 
cash flow growth rates consider estimates of both aum flows and market expectations by asset class equity  fixed income and liquidity and by investment manager based upon  among other things  historical experience and expectations of future market performance from internal and external sources 
the impact of both net client flows and market performance on cash flows are projected for the near term generally the first five years based on a year by year assessment that considers current market conditions  our experience  our internal financial projections  relevant publicly available statistics and projections  and discussions with our own market experts 
actual cash flows in any one period may vary from the projected cash flows without resulting in an impairment charge because a variance in any one period must be considered in conjunction with other assumptions that impact projected cash flows 
discount rates are based on appropriately weighted estimated costs of debt and capital using a market participant perspective 
we estimate the cost of debt based on published debt rates 
we estimate the cost of capital based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the risk free interest rate  market risk and size premiums  peer group betas and unsystematic risk 
the discount rates are also calibrated based on an assessment of relevant market values 
goodwill principally originated from the acquisitions of cam  permal and royce 
the value of the reporting unit is based on projected net cash flows of assets managed in our mutual funds  closed end funds and other proprietary funds  in addition to separate account assets of our managers 
for our annual december impairment test  the projected cash flows are discounted at to determine the present value of cash flows 
as of december   the implied fair value significantly exceeds the carrying value 
projected cash flows  on an aggregate basis across all asset classes  are assumed to have an average annual growth rate of approximately 
cash flow growth is based on separate factors for equity  fixed income  and liquidity products 
equity product growth projections are based on long term growth experience and current market conditions 
fixed income product growth projections are based on the past experience of our primary fixed income manager and current market influences relevant to their business  available historical experience and market statistics  and estimates of future expectations 
we believe our growth assumptions are reasonable given our consideration of multiple inputs  including internal and external sources described above 
however  our assumptions are subject to change based on fluctuations in our actual results and market conditions 
assuming all other factors remain the same  actual results and changes in assumptions would have to cause our cash flow projections over the long term to deviate approximately from previous projections or the discount rate would have to increase approximately eight percentage points for goodwill to be considered for impairment 
as of december   considering relevant prices of our common shares  our market capitalization  along with a reasonable control premium  exceeds the aggregate carrying values of our reporting unit 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation plans include stock options  employee stock purchase plans  market based performance share awards  restricted stock awards and deferred compensation payable in stock 
under our stock compensation plans  we issue equity awards to directors  officers  and key employees 
in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance  compensation expense for the years ended march   and  includes compensation cost for all non vested share based awards at their grant date fair value amortized over the respective vesting periods on the straight line method 
also  under the accounting guidance  cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of or less than the stock based compensation expense are classified as financing cash flows 
we granted million  million  and million stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
for additional information on share based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of each option grant using the black scholes option pricing model  except for market based grants  for which we would use a monte carlo option pricing model 
both models require management to develop estimates regarding certain input variables 
the inputs for the black scholes model include stock price on the date of grant  exercise price of the option  dividend yield  volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rate  all of which except the grant date stock price and the exercise price require estimates or assumptions 
we calculate the dividend yield based upon the average of the historical quarterly dividend payments over a term equal to the vesting period of the options 
we estimate volatility equally weighted between the historical prices of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the option and the implied volatility of market listed options at the date of grant 
the expected life is the estimated length of time an option will be held before it is either exercised or canceled  based upon our historical option exercise experience 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options being valued 
if we used different methods to estimate our variables for the black scholes and monte carlo models  or if we used a different type of option pricing model  the fair value of our option grants might be different 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the federal  state and local jurisdictions of the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we file income tax returns representing our filing positions with each jurisdiction 
due to the inherent complexities arising from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions  we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax provision for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are used in determining the tax basis of assets and liabilities and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax and financial statement purposes 
management assesses the likelihood that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized  then a valuation allowance is established with a corresponding increase to deferred tax provision 
substantially all of our deferred tax assets relate to us and us taxing jurisdictions 
as of march   us federal deferred tax assets aggregated million  realization of which is expected to require billion of future us earnings  approximately million of which must be in the form of foreign sourced income 
deferred tax assets generated in us jurisdictions resulting from net operating losses generally expire years after they are generated and those resulting from foreign tax credits generally expire years after they are generated 
based on estimates of future taxable income  using assumptions consistent with those used in our goodwill impairment testing  it is more likely than not that current federal tax benefits relating to net operating losses are realizable and no valuation allowance is necessary at this time 
with respect to those resulting from foreign tax credits  it is more likely than not that tax benefits relating to million foreign tax credits will not be realizable and a valuation allowance of million was recorded in fiscal with respect thereto 
while tax planning may enhance our positions  the realization of current tax benefits is not dependent on any significant tax strategies 
as of march   us state deferred tax assets aggregated million 
due to limitations on net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and  taking into consideration certain state tax planning strategies  a valuation allowance has been established for the state capital loss and net operating loss benefits in certain jurisdictions in the amount of million for fiscal due to the uncertainty of future state apportionment factors and future effective state tax rates  the value of state net operating loss benefits ultimately realized may vary 
a net release of million in fiscal of the full valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets related to various jurisdictions  primarily the uk and japan 
to the extent our analysis of the realization of deferred tax assets relies on deferred tax liabilities  we have considered the timing  nature and jurisdiction of reversals  as well as  future increases relating to the tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets 
in the event we determine all or any portion of our deferred tax assets that are not already subject to a valuation allowance are not realizable  we will be required to establish a valuation allowance by a charge to the income tax provision in the period in which that determination is made 
depending on the facts and circumstances  the charge could be material to our earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax uncertainties in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due
