the contingent consideration is based upon profitability of the acquired products for post closing periods through june  the acquisition included inventories  property and equipment  contract rights  intangible assets  and certain specified operating liabilities that existed at the closing date 
the company also hired most of antone s employees 
antone products include a line of high performance tower mounted amplifiers  multi carrier power amplifier boosters  and cell site antenna sharing products

of the total purchase price  million was placed in escrow at closing for one year as security for certain indemnity obligations of the company 
on march   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell certain assets and transfer certain liabilities of the cns segment to netgear  inc netgear for million in cash 
this transaction closed on april  the cns asset sale 
as part of the cns asset sale  most of the cns segment s customer relationships  contracts and employees were transferred to netgear 
the company retained one major cns customer relationship and contract 
as part of the agreement  the company agreed to indemnify netgear following the closing of the sale against specified losses in connection with the cns business and generally retained responsibility for various legal liabilities that may accrue 
an escrow balance of million was established for one year for this purpose or for other claims 
netgear has made claims against the escrow balance for a dispute and indemnity claims 
the company believes the escrow will be released in due course 
the company completed the remaining product shipments under this contract in december and continues to provide warranty under its contractual obligation 
the company continues to supply ancillary products  software and services to the retained customer 
the company also retained within its cns division the homecloud product development program 
the homecloud product family which is under development aims to provide a new suite of service into the home including enhanced security  media and information management  sharing and delivery  home control  and network management

these products sell into three primary markets wireless service providers  wireline service providers including integrated wireline wireless service providers  and industrial and utility companies 

table of contents the prices for the products vary based upon volume  customer specifications and other criteria  and are subject to change due to competition among telecommunications manufacturers and service providers 
the company s customer base for its products is highly concentrated and comprised primarily of major us telecommunications service providers telephone companies  independent domestic local exchange carriers and public telephone administrations located outside the us due to the stringent quality specifications of its customers and the regulated environment in which its customers operate  the company must undergo lengthy approval and procurement processes prior to selling its products 
accordingly  the company must make significant up front investments in product and market development prior to actual commencement of sales of new products 
to remain competitive  the company must continue to invest in new product development and invest in targeted sales and marketing efforts to launch new product lines 
failure to increase revenues from new products  whether due to lack of market acceptance  competition  technological change or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
the company expects to continue to evaluate new product opportunities and engage in extensive research and development activities 
in view of the company s current reliance on the telecommunications market for revenues and the unpredictability of orders and pricing pressures  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies the company uses estimates and judgments in applying its accounting policies that have a significant impact on the results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the following are the company s most critical accounting policies 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased and include bank deposits  money market funds and debt instruments consisting of pre refunded municipal bonds 
the pre refunded municipal bonds are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
money market funds are accounted for as available for sale securities under the requirements of accounting standards codification asc topic  investments debt and equity securities asc 
short term investments certificates of deposit held for investment with an original maturity greater than days are carried at cost and included in short term investments 
the certificates of deposit are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and are not debt securities 
the company also invests in debt instruments consisting of pre refunded municipal bonds 
the income and principal from these pre refunded bonds are secured by an irrevocable trust holding u 
s treasury securities 
the bonds have original maturities of greater than days  but upon acquisition by the company have remaining maturities of less than one year 
the pre refunded municipal bonds are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
inventory reserves the company reviews inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence based on its best estimates of future demand  product lifecycle status and product development plans 
the company uses historical information along with these future estimates to reserve for obsolete and potentially obsolete inventory 
the company also evaluates inventory to adjust valuations to be the lower of cost or market value 
prices anticipated for future inventory demand are compared to current and committed inventory values 
inventory purchase commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into non cancellable commitments for the purchase of inventory 
the commitments are at market rates 
should there be a significant decline in revenues the company may absorb excess inventory and subsequent losses as a result of these commitments 
the company establishes reserves for potential losses on at risk commitments 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of asc topic  income taxes asc 
asc requires an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets  including net operating loss nol and certain tax credit carryovers and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the tax differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets which are not likely to be realized 
on a regular basis  management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
see note for further discussion of the company s income taxes 
goodwill and intangibles in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
the company elected to early adopt the standard for the purpose of its goodwill impairment testing 
the company complies with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc  which requires that goodwill and indefinite lived assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the company concludes that this it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step tests for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology estimating future cash flow  discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions  as well as  current like company market transactions 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
the company did not recognize any impairment loss on goodwill in fiscal years  or the company has an indefinite lived intangible asset related to the noran tel trade name 
to determine the fair value of the trade name  the company calculates the amount of royalty income it could generate if the name was licensed in an arm s length transaction to a third party 
no impairment loss was recognized related to indefinite lived assets in fiscal years  or on an ongoing basis  the company reviews intangible assets with a definite life and other long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that carrying values may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company will recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
any impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue revenue recognition on equipment where software is incidental to the product as a whole or where software is essential to the equipment s functionality and falls under software accounting scope exceptions generally occurs when products are shipped  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met  no significant obligations remain  collection is reasonably assured and warranty can be estimated 
where multiple element arrangements exist  fair value of each element is established using the relative selling price method  which requires the company to use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  reliable third party objective evidence tpe or management s best estimate of selling price  in that order 

table of contents stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation using the provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
asc requires the grant date fair value recognition of expense related to employee stock based compensations awards over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of equity based options requires the company to estimate the expected volatility of its stock  the risk free interest rate  expected option term  expected dividend yield and expected forfeitures 
product warranties most of the company s products carry a limited warranty ranging up to seven years for westell segment products and from one to three years for cns segment products 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs as products are shipped based on historical sales and cost of repair or replacement trends relative to sales 
new accounting standards adopted effective january   the company adopted asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of asc  but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and the international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments in this update are applied prospectively 
adoption of this asu did not have a material impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity and requires the presentation of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
this update was applied retrospectively 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  but required a change in the presentation of the company s comprehensive income from the notes of the consolidated financial statements to present two separate but consecutive statements 
effective january   the company adopted asu  comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
asu defers the changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments to other comprehensive income 
these amendments are being delayed to allow the fasb time to redeliberate whether to present the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements for all periods presented 
while the fasb is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  the company is required to continue reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before asu results of operations fiscal years ended march   and revenue fiscal year ended march  increase decrease in thousands vs

income taxes income tax in fiscal year was expense of million compared to an income tax benefit of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
in fiscal year  the company sold its conferenceplus subsidiary and completed the cns asset sale 
these events resulted in a million gain in fiscal year and changed the outlook for future taxable income  positively with regards to the cns business which contributed to the majority of the company s historical losses and negatively in certain states where income generated by conferenceplus was apportioned 
in addition  certain states for which the company has net operating loss carryforwards  such as illinois  suspended the use of those carryforwards 
the company therefore was not able to utilize those carryforwards to offset fiscal year taxable income 
the company considered both the positive and negative evidence and established a forecast of future taxable income to evaluate the deferred tax assets for realizability 
on this basis  the company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would be able to utilize the majority of its deferred tax assets but that certain state net operating loss carryforwards would expire prior to utilization 
as a consequence  the company increased the valuation allowance reserve by million to million in fiscal year in addition  the company recognized million of net tax benefits relating to the change in uncertain tax positions

net income net income was million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the changes were due to the cumulative effects of the variances identified above 
quarterly results of operations the company has and may continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
such fluctuations in quarterly results may correspond to substantial fluctuations in the market price of the class a common stock 
some factors which have had an influence on and may continue to influence the company s results of operations in a particular quarter include  but are not limited to  the size and timing of customer orders and subsequent shipments  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products  timing of product introductions or enhancements by the company or its competitors  market acceptance of new products  technological changes in the telecommunications industry  competitive pricing pressures  accuracy of customer forecasts of end user demand  write offs for excess or obsolete inventory  changes in the company s operating expenses  personnel changes  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in the mix of products sold  quality control of products sold  disruption in sources of supply  regulatory changes  capital spending  delays of payments by customers  working capital deficits and general economic conditions 
sales to the company s customers typically involve long approval and procurement cycles and can involve large purchase commitments 
accordingly  cancellation or deferral of orders could cause significant fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
as a result  the company believes that period to period comparisons of its results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and caution should be used when placing reliance upon such comparisons as indications of future performance

the company has maintained such balances since entering the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that include a minimum tangible net worth and a limitation on capital expenditures for any fiscal year 
the company was in compliance with these covenants on march  in addition  although the company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  the company s credit facility restricts the company s ability to pay dividends without bank approval 
the consolidated statements of cash flows include the conferenceplus discontinued operations and therefore the explanations below include cash flows of conferenceplus 
the company s operating activities used cash of million in fiscal year and generated cash of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively

federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal year realization of deferred tax assets associated with the company s future deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration  among other factors 
the company uses estimates of future taxable income to assess the valuation allowance required against deferred tax assets 
management periodically evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets and may adjust the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets accordingly 
off balance sheet arrangements in fiscal year  the company sold its data station termination product lines and specified fixed assets to enginuity communications corporation enginuity 
the company provided an unconditional guarantee relating to a year term note payable by enginuity to a third party lender that financed the transaction the enginuity note 
the enginuity note had an unpaid balance of million as of march  certain owners of enginuity personally guaranteed the note and pledged assets as collateral 
these personal guarantees will stay in place until the note is paid in full  as will the company s 
under the company s guarantee  the company must pay all amounts due under the note payable upon demand from the lender  however  the company would have recourse against the assets of enginuity  the personal guarantees  and pledged assets 
the company evaluated asc and concluded that enginuity is a vie as a result of the debt guarantee 
the company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the vie and consolidation therefore has not been and is not required 
at the time of the product sale  the company assessed its obligation under this guarantee pursuant to the provisions of fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  as codified in asc topic  guarantees asc  and recorded a million liability for the value of the guarantee 
the balance of the guarantee liability was  as of march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency rate exposures and interest rates 
foreign currency risk the company has a foreign subsidiary in canada that develops and sells products primarily for sale in that country and the united states 
the company is exposed to potential gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s primary future exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
approximately of the company s fiscal year revenue was denominated in foreign currencies 
the company estimates market risk as the potential decrease in pretax earnings resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the ending exchange rate of 
if such a 
table of contents decrease occurred  the company would incur approximately  in additional other expense at march  as of march   the balance in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized gain of  the company is relocating the majority of the canadian operations to its location in aurora  illinois 
the remaining operations in canada will consist of research and development as well as sales in support of the us operations 
the company expects to complete this transition by july  at that time  the functional currency of the canadian operations will change from the canadian dollar to the us dollar 
although the company s supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency rates  particularly for asian currencies  may have indirect impacts on the company s costs 
interest rate and default risk the company has an investment portfolio consisting of bank deposits  money market funds  certificates of deposit and pre refunded municipal bonds 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  may be subject to interest rate risk and default risk  and they will fall in value if market interest rates increase or if risks of default rise 
due to the short duration and conservative  high quality nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio
