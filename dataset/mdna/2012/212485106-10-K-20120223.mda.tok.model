we turn these everyday interactions into a source of profit and strategic advantage for our clients 
for over years  our unique combination of domain expertise  operational excellence and innovative technologies has delivered process improvement and actionable business insight to clients to enhance their relationship with customers 
prior to june  we had three reportable segments  customer management  information management and human resources management hr management 
in march  we signed a definitive agreement to sell the hr management line of business to northgatearinso for approximately  with in cash at closing and in cash over three years 
the sale substantially closed on june   for which we received approximately in cash as well as a zero coupon note in the principal amount of the sales of certain foreign operations of the hr management business completed during the third and fourth quarters of  resulted in a receipt of an additional in cash 
final settlement of working capital adjustments resulted in cash payments to northgatearinso of approximately during the fourth quarter of in connection with the sale of the hr management line of business  we reorganized our reportable segments into two segments  customer management  which provides agent assisted services  self service  and intelligent technology care solutions  and information management  which provides business support system bss solutions 
see note for information about these segments 
as a result of the sale of the hr management line of business  the operating results and assets and liabilities related to hr management have been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
certain costs previously allocated to the hr management segment that do not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment are now reported as costs from continuing operations within corporate and other 
these costs previously allocated to hr management that are now included in corporate and other within selling  general and administrative costs were and for the years ending december  and  respectively 
beginning june   we began earning transition services revenues for services provided to the buyer under agreements lasting from three to eighteen months 
through the end of  we earned in revenue under these transition services agreements subsequent to the close of the sale 
these revenues are reflected in corporate and other and largely offset the related costs described above incurred subsequent to june  while the length of the transition services agreements vary depending upon the type of service provided  we have taken and continue to take actions to reduce these costs and our expectation is that we will eliminate the underlying costs as the transition services are completed 
the total gain on the sale of hr management amounted to pretax and after tax at december  the sale of hr management was a taxable transaction that resulted in being recorded for the combined federal  state and foreign income tax obligation in subsequently  in  a reduction to the tax on the gain on this transaction was recorded and has been reflected in discontinued operations 
the high effective tax rate on the transaction was largely due to substantially lower tax basis in goodwill as compared to book value

customer management remaining revenues are derived from the sale of premise based and hosted automated self care and technology solutions

we use free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company

adjusted free cash flow for also includes paid in connection with the refinancing of the orlando synthetic lease we believe that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations  such as investment in the company s existing businesses 
further  free cash flow facilitates management s ability to strengthen the company s balance sheet  to repay the company s debt obligations and to repurchase the company s common shares 
limitations associated with the use of free cash flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions 
management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both the non gaap measures  free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow  and the gaap measure  net cash flows from operating activities  in its evaluation of performance 
there are no material purposes for which we use these non gaap measures beyond the purposes described above

the company also uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the calculations for certain employee incentive compensation plans 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from continuing operations  net of tax  or other income statement data prepared in accordance with gaap and our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
management uses both the non gaap measure  adjusted ebitda  and the gaap measure  income from continuing operations  net of tax  in its evaluation of underlying performance

capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual commitments at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and capital lease obligations and  of equity 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and capital lease obligations and  of equity 
the total debt to capital ratio at december  was  which compares to at december  the decrease in this ratio is due to a lower level of borrowings and higher level of equity in compared to on march    we entered into a four year competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement the new credit facility 
this new credit facility replaces our five year competitive advance and revolving credit facility agreement the prior credit facility  dated as of october  and as amended subsequently  among convergys and a group of financial institutions 
in connection with our entry into the new credit facility  we terminated the prior credit facility 
there were no balances outstanding under the prior revolving facility at december  we have two borrowing options available under the new credit facility i a competitive advance option which is provided on an uncommitted competitive advance basis through an auction mechanism and ii a revolving credit option which is provided on a committed basis 
under each option  amounts borrowed and repaid may be re borrowed subject to availability 
borrowings under the new credit facility bear interest at one of the rates described in the new credit facility 
the new credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of interest coverage and debt to ebitda ratios as defined in the new credit facility 
the company s interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of ebitda to consolidated interest expense  cannot be less than to as determined on a rolling four quarter basis 
our debt to ebitda ratio cannot be greater than to until december  and to convergys corporation annual report after december  the new credit facility also contains customary representations and warranties 
in the event of a default  the lenders may terminate the commitments and declare the amounts outstanding  and all accrued interest  immediately due and payable 
the maturity date of the new credit facility is march  except that  upon the satisfaction of certain conditions  we may extend the maturity date by one year twice during the term 
we will pay an annual facility fee regardless of utilization 
at december  the facility was undrawn 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  in december  we issued in unsecured senior notes senior notes due december  during the first nine months of  we retired approximately of the outstanding debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced an exchange offer  under the terms of which the company offered to exchange one thousand twenty dollars in principal amount of its new junior subordinated convertible debentures due september convertible debentures for each one thousand dollars in principal amount of its senior notes 
we issued a total of aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures in exchange for of the senior notes 
this exchange transaction resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of that is reflected within other income expense  net  in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  following the settlement of the exchange  approximately aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remained outstanding that was fully paid in december the entire balance of the convertible debentures was outstanding as of december  and december  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we leased an office complex in orlando  florida  under an agreement that expired in june the orlando lease 
pursuant to the terms of the lease  on october   we were required to provide notice to the lessor of our intention to either purchase the property for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party the terms of the lease provided the lessor with a residual value guarantee from us of up to 
although continuing to pursue a refinancing of the orlando lease  on october   we effectively elected the purchase option under the required notification provision of the lease agreement 
on june   we refinanced this lease agreement 
as part of the refinancing  we paid approximately to reduce the principal under the prior facility related to the residual value guarantee provision referenced above  such amount having been previously accrued 
the new facility provides for a new lease period of five years 
upon termination or expiration of the new lease facility  we are required to either purchase the property for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party the terms of the lease provide the lessor with a residual value guarantee from us of up to 
total scheduled lease payments during the term are currently estimated to be approximately at december  and  we accounted for the orlando lease as a capital lease 
during  we entered into a asset securitization facility collateralized by accounts receivable of certain of the company s subsidiaries  of which was scheduled to expire in june and expires in june the that was scheduled to expire in june was extended through june during june  the company renegotiated the terms of the agreement  increasing the purchase limit to and extending the terms to june the asset securitization program is conducted through convergys funding inc  a wholly owned subsidiary 
the asset securitization facility does not qualify for sale treatment under the authoritative guidance for the accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  the accounts receivable and related debt obligation will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the facility was undrawn 
at december   we had borrowings of under this facility 
during  we repurchased of our common shares for pursuant to outstanding authorizations 
the timing and terms of any future transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and our liquidity 
in october  the company announced that its board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to an incremental of outstanding common shares from time to time as market and business conditions warrant 
at december   the company has authority to repurchase an additional pursuant to this authorization 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods convergys corporation annual report contractual obligations total less than year years after years debt and capital lease obligations debt interest operating leases pension contributions unrecognized tax benefits total see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
this includes interest expense on both variable and fixed rate debt and capital lease obligations 
variable interest rates have been assumed to remain constant at current levels through the end of the term 
this includes only the cash payable compound of interest expense in our convertible debentures 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in order to meet erisa funding requirements  the company expects to contribute to fund its cash balance pension plan in estimates for and beyond assume a return on assets and effective interest rate of 
actual cash payments may vary based upon actual performance 
unrecognized tax benefits of are excluded from this table as the uncertainty related to the amount and period of any cash settlement prevents the company from making a reasonably reliable estimate 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately  bond obligations of approximately related to performance and payment guarantees  and related to our former hr management line of business 
upon completion of the sale of the hr management business  we continue to be responsible for these bond obligations 
although northgatearinso is obligated to indemnify the company for any and all losses  costs  liabilities and expenses incurred related to these performance bonds  the company maintains a liability of approximately we believe that any guarantee obligation that may arise related to performance and payment guarantees of continuing operations will not be material 
we also have purchase commitments with telecommunications providers of approximately for market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with investment grade rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and in outstanding fixed rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our variable borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
our variable interest rate debt had an effective interest rate of during the year ended december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately we sometimes use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using contact center capacity in the philippines  india  canada and colombia 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  indian rupees inr  canadian convergys corporation annual report dollars cad or colombian pesos cop  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
beginning in  we entered into a contract with a client priced in australian dollars aud 
as of december   we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in these foreign currencies by entering into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of php  at a fixed price of at various dates through december  inr  at a fixed price of at various dates through december  cad at a fixed price of at various dates through december and cop  at a fixed price of at various dates through december  and to sell a total of aud at a fixed price of at various dates through december the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be substantially mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables  payables and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill the company has recorded on its consolidated balance sheets goodwill of and at december  and december   respectively 
the december  balance is after a goodwill impairment charge related to the customer interaction technology cit reporting unit formerly referred to as the relationship technology management rtm reporting unit  which is within the customer management segment 
the cit reporting unit is comprised primarily of intervoice  which was acquired in september the impairment charge for the company s cit reporting unit was the result of a change in the strategic plan for the unit  which was finalized in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the output of the company s annual strategic business planning process 
as a result of declining revenue during the preceding months  lower future revenue projections and transaction valuation multiples lower than those supported at the time of the intervoice acquisition  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than carrying value 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units  it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition  but instead becomes identified with a reporting unit as a whole 
as a result  all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit 
as of december   the company operated in two core business segments as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level  one level below the business segment 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in the company s stock price 
convergys corporation annual report for and the company tested goodwill for the following reporting units customer management live agents  customer management cit cit  and information management 
under us gaap  the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit step 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value  the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any  for that reporting unit 
when required  the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the net assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
an impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot be reversed subsequently even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock prices or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  fair value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
the forecasted cash flows are based upon the company s long term strategic business plan  and a terminal value is used to estimate the operating segment s cash flows beyond this plan 
the discount rate represents the weighted average cost of capital  which is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise 
both the market and income approaches require the use of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based upon an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows and were concluded to be for the customer management live agent and information management reporting units and for the cit reporting unit for sensitivity analyses were performed around discount rates and growth rates  including terminal growth rates  in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
a combination of methodologies is used and weighted appropriately for reporting units with significant adverse changes in business climate 
based on the results of step for the cit reporting unit  there was an indication of impairment as the carrying value exceeded the fair value of the reporting unit 
accordingly  the second step of testing was performed for cit 
based on the results of the second step  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge net of tax in the fourth quarter of  included in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining goodwill balance allocated to the cit reporting unit at december  was while no impairment was noted in step of the cit reporting unit impairment test at october   goodwill present in the reporting unit may be sensitive to further revenue declines due to soft economic activity and increased competition 
based on the current year results of step for the cit reporting unit  there was no indication of impairment as the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit by 
the amount of goodwill allocated to the cit reporting unit at the october  testing date was the results of step for customer management live agents and information management reporting units indicated there was no goodwill impairment in or each of these reporting units fair value was in excess of the carrying value by approximately or more 
a basis point increase in the discount rate and decrease in the expected future cash flows would not change the results of step we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates  including future sales and margin trends  market conditions and cash flow could result in an impairment loss 
the company compared and assessed the total fair values of the reporting units to its market capitalization at the convergys corporation annual report annual assessment date to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
the fair value of the company s reporting units reasonably approximates total market capitalization adjusted for a reasonable implied control premium 
subsequent to the company s annual impairment test for each of its reporting units  no indications of impairment were identified 
other intangible assets at december   we had a carrying value of of other intangible assets  net of amortization  consisting of in software  which is classified in property  plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets  in trademarks related to the intervoice acquisition and in customer relationships 
as amortizable intangible assets  the company evaluates the intangible assets for recoverability on an annual basis or if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amounts  by comparing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying values of the related assets 
based on the results of testing  no impairment charges were recognized in the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of was an impairment indicator  however  testing resulted in no impairment to the other intangible assets in property  plant and equipment the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that the company uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell certain facilities included in the cit reporting unit 
accordingly  the property met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and was required to be measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
we determined the fair value was less than its carrying amount  therefore we recognized an impairment loss of after tax included in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
during  the company sold one of the two facilities at its carrying value and therefore  no gain or loss was recognized on the sale 
at december   the company had not identified a buyer for the second facility 
the property no longer meets the held for sale criteria 
the facility was reclassified to property and equipment  net on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under us gaap  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and convergys corporation annual report negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical pre tax and taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax activities and evaluates uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit  which is the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be significantly different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgments and estimates 
restructuring charges we recognize liabilities for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
during the last three years  we recorded restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs that will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with the abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we have used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to estimate the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes multiple element outsourcing arrangements we deliver multiple services under our client arrangements and we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting and revenue is recognized as we deliver each of the contractual services 
if these criteria are not met  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once we begin to deliver the final service 
license arrangements the accounting for our license and support and maintenance arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues convergys corporation annual report using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of cost of providing services and products sold 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
the assessments of these areas require us to make a significant number of judgments 
the judgments made in these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
other we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans and self insurance accruals
