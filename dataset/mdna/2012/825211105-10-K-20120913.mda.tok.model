item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed above in the section entitled risk factors 
we report results on a fiscal year ending june for ease of reference within this section  refers to the fiscal year ended june   refers to the fiscal year ended june   and refers to the fiscal year ended june  overview we are a leading provider of ip telecommunications solutions for enterprises 
we were founded in september and shipped our first system in since that time  we have continued to develop and enhance our product line 
our acquisition of m networks  inc m  a leader in providing hosted unified communication solutions in the third quarter of fiscal  expanded our products and service offerings to now include hosted solutions 
our acquisition of agito networks  inc agito  a leader in platform agnostic enterprise mobility  in the second quarter of fiscal  expanded our existing mobile solution with the vision of allowing users to communicate on any device  such as a desk phone  mobile phone  or computer  at any location using any cellular or wi fi network simply and cost effectively 
our solutions are available for businesses to operate in their own premise data centers or on a hosted  cloud based platform 
solutions within our premise segment are comprised of our switches  ip phones and software application which work with our unique ip architecture to provide a brilliantly integrated communication system 
our shoretel sky solutions are sold within our hosted segment formerly known as our cloud segment and are comprised of m s unique software delivered to the customer using our routers and ip phones 

table of contents our phone and switch products are manufactured by contract manufacturers located in united states and in china 
our contract manufacturers provide us with a range of operational and manufacturing services  including component procurement  final testing and assembly of our products  which allows us to scale our business without the significant capital investment and on going expenses required to establish and maintain a manufacturing operation 
we sell our premise products primarily through channel partners that market and sell our systems to enterprises across all industries  including small  medium and large companies and public institutions 
our channel partners include resellers as well as value added distributors who in turn sell to the resellers 
we believe our channel strategy allows us to reach a larger number of prospective enterprise customers more effectively than if we were to sell directly 
the number of our authorized channel partners grew to over  as of june   representing approximately year over year growth 
our internal sales and marketing personnel support these channel partners in their selling efforts 
in some circumstances  the enterprise customer will purchase products directly from us  but in these situations we typically compensate the channel partner for its sales efforts 
at the request of the channel partner  we often ship our products directly to the enterprise customer 
most channel partners perform installation and implementation services for the enterprises that use our systems 
generally  our channel partners provide the post contractual support to the enterprise customer by providing first level support services and purchasing additional services from us under a post contractual support contract 
for channel partners without support capabilities or that do not desire to provide support  we offer full support contracts to provide all of the support to enterprise customers 
our channel partners may provide managed services offerings to the enterprise customer under which the channel partner may purchase our products and services and  in turn  charge the enterprise customer a monthly subscription fee to access those products and services 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into arrangements with two major value added distributors to distribute our comprehensive line of premise business communication solutions to resellers within the united states in what we refer to as a two tier distribution model 
during fiscal  we have expanded our two tier network and added more value added distributors to the network 
we believe that the two tier distribution model allows us to better serve our existing channel partners  to reach a larger number of prospective enterprise customers more effectively and to position us to continue to build momentum and capture increased market share in the ip telephony  mobility and uc markets 
furthermore  the two tier distribution model allows us to scale our business operations without making significant investments in product distribution facilities  thus allowing us to manage our cost structure 
although  we have historically sold our systems primarily to small and medium sized enterprises  in recent years  we have been expanding our sales and marketing activities to increase our focus on larger enterprise customers  including the creation of a major accounts program whereby our sales personnel assist our channel partners to sell to large enterprise customers 
as of june   we had sold our products to approximately  enterprise customers  representing approximately year over year growth 
to the extent  we continue to successfully acquire larger enterprise customers in the united states and worldwide  we expect our sales cycle to increase  and the demands on our sales and support infrastructure to increase 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california and have sales  customer support  general and administrative and engineering functions in austin  texas 
after the acquisition of m  our shoretel sky services are provided from our offices in new york city and rochester  new york and chicago  illinois 
the majority of our personnel work at these locations 
sales  engineering  and support personnel are also located throughout the united states and  to a lesser extent  in canada  the united kingdom  ireland  germany  spain  hong kong  singapore and australia 
while most of our customers are located in the united states  we have continued to achieve growth in revenue from international sales  which accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal as compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect sales to customers in the united states will continue to comprise the majority of our sales in the foreseeable future 
in fiscal  we continued to grow our market share of the ip telephony market  both in the united states and worldwide 
our total revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  driven by sales to new customers  add on sales from existing customers and the addition of shoretel sky services revenue after the m acquisition 
our operating expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to increases in compensation expenses related to growth in headcount including stock based based compensation  the addition of expenses from the m operations and the incurrence of non recurring acquisition related costs 
in fiscal  we increased our headcount by  with most of the growth in headcount coming from the employees assumed and retained in connection with our acquisition of m  additions to our sales  product development and support workforce to support efforts to grow our sales channel and to enhance our product development activities  among other things 
key business metrics we monitor a number of key metrics to help forecast growth  establish budgets  measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and to measure operational effectiveness 

table of contents initial and repeat sales orders 
our goal is to attract a significant number of new enterprise customers and to encourage existing enterprise customers to purchase additional products and support 
many enterprise customers make an initial purchase and deploy additional sites at a later date and also purchase additional products and support as their businesses expand 
as our installed enterprise customer base has grown  a large portion of orders has come from existing enterprise customers 
in fiscal year  premise billings from existing enterprise customers represented approximately of total billings compared with and in fiscal and  respectively 
deferred revenue 
deferred revenue relates to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on delivery of service  support  specific commitments  product and services delivered to our value added distributors that have not been delivered or sold through to resellers  and other factors 
deferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from our transactions and are recognized as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
nearly all of our premise system sales include the purchase of post contractual support contracts with terms of up to five years  and our renewal rates on these contracts have been high historically 
we recognize support revenue on a ratable basis over the term of the support contract 
since we receive payment for support in advance of recognizing the related revenue  we carry a deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet 
this deferred revenue helps provide predictability to our future support and services revenue 
almost all of our hosted services are billed a month in advance 
billings that are collected before the service is delivered are included in the deferred revenue balance on our consolidated balance sheet 
these amounts are recognized as revenue as the services are delivered 
our deferred revenue balance at june  was million  of which million is expected to be recognized within one year 
gross margin 
our gross margin for premise segment products is primarily affected by our ability to reduce hardware costs faster than the decline in average overall system sales prices 
we strive to increase our product gross margin by reducing hardware costs through product redesign and volume discount pricing from our suppliers 
in general  product gross margin on our switches is greater than product gross margin on our ip phones 
as the prices and costs of our hardware components have decreased over time  our software components  which have lower costs than our hardware components  have represented a greater percentage of our overall margin on system sales 
we consider our ability to monitor and manage these factors to be a key aspect of maintaining product gross margins and increasing our profitability 
gross margin for premise segment support and services is slightly lower than gross margin for products and is impacted primarily by labor related expenses 
the primary goal of our support and services function is to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction and our investments in support personnel and infrastructure are made with this goal in mind 
we expect that as our installed enterprise customer base grows  we may be able to slightly improve gross margin for support and services through economies of scale 
however  the timing of additional investments in our support and services infrastructure could materially affect our cost of support and services revenue  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of support and services revenue and total revenue  in any particular period 
gross margin for the hosted segment services is lower than the gross margins for the premise segment and is impacted primarily by the reselling of broadband costs to customers  employee related expense  data communication cost  carrier cost  telecom taxes  and intangible asset amortization expense 
we expect that with the growth in customer base  the gross margins may reflect improvement 
operating expense 
our operating expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and benefits for our employees 
accordingly  increases in operating expenses historically have been primarily related to increases in our headcount 
we intend to expand our workforce to support our anticipated growth  and therefore  our ability to forecast revenue is critical to managing our operating expenses 
average revenue per user 
we calculate the monthly average service revenue per user arpu for our hosted segment as the average monthly recurring revenue per customer divided by the average number of seats per customer 
the average monthly recurring revenue per customer is calculated as the monthly recurring service revenue from customers in the period  divided by the simple average number of business customers during the period 
our arpu includes telco circuits that we resell that could  as a percentage of our business  decline over time as our average customer size increases and therefore they are more apt to have their own networks already established 
our monthly arpu for the three month period ended june  is customer churn 
customer churn for our hosted segment is calculated by dividing the monthly recurring revenue from customers that have terminated during a period by the simple average of the total monthly recurring revenue from all customers in a given period 
the effective management of subscriber churn is critical to our ability to maximize revenue growth and to maintain and improve margins 
our annualized customer churn as of june  is 
basis of presentation revenue 
we derive our revenue from sales of our premise ip telecommunications systems and related support and services as well as hosted services 

table of contents premise revenue 
our typical system includes a combination of ip phones  switches and software applications primarily for our premise business 
we sell our products through channel partners that include resellers and value added distributors 
prices to a given channel partner for hardware and software products depend on that channel partner s volume and customer satisfaction levels  as well as our own strategic considerations 
in circumstances where we sell directly to the enterprise customer in transactions that have been assisted by channel partners  we report our revenue net of any associated payment to the channel partners that assisted in such sales 
this results in recognized revenue from a direct sale approximating the revenue that would have been recognized from a sale of a comparable system through a channel partner 
product revenue has accounted for   and of our total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
premise support and services revenue primarily consists of post contractual support  and to a lesser extent revenue from training services  professional services and installations that we perform 
post contractual support includes software updates which grant rights to unspecified software license upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period 
post contractual support also includes both internet and phone based technical support 
revenue from post contractual support is recognized ratably over the contractual service period 
premise support and services revenues accounted for  and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
hosted revenue 
hosted services and solutions consist primarily of our proprietary hosted voip unified communications system as well as other services such as foreign and domestic calling plans  certain uc applications  internet service provisioning  training and other professional services 
additionally  we offer our customers the ability to purchases phones systems from us directly or rent such systems as part of their service agreements 
our hosted services are sold through indirect channel resellers and a direct sales force 
our customers typically enter into month service agreements whereby they are billed for such services on a monthly basis 
revenue from our hosted services is recognized on a monthly basis as services are delivered 
revenue associated with various calling plans and internet services are recognized as such services are provided 
hosted revenues accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal there was no hosted or related services revenue in any of the fiscal years prior to cost of revenue 
cost of premise product revenue consists primarily of hardware costs  royalties and license fees for third party software included in our systems  salary and related overhead costs of operations personnel  freight  warranty costs and provision for excess inventory 
the majority of these costs vary with the unit volumes of products sold 
cost of premise support and services revenue consists of salary and related overhead costs of personnel engaged in support and service activities 
cost of hosted services revenue consists of personnel and related costs of the hosted operation  data center costs  data communication cost  carrier cost and amortization of intangible assets research and development expenses 
research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs  outside engineering costs  professional services  prototype costs  test equipment  software usage fees and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses are recognized when incurred 
we capitalize development costs incurred from determination of technological feasibility through general release of the product to customers 
we are devoting substantial resources to the development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products and related software applications 
we intend to continue to make significant investments in our research and development efforts because we believe they are essential to maintaining and improving our competitive position 
accordingly  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include personnel costs  sales commissions  travel  marketing promotional and lead generation programs  branding and advertising  trade shows  sales demonstration equipment  professional services fees  amortization of intangible assets  and facilities expenses 
we plan to continue to invest in development of our distribution channel by increasing the size of our field sales force to enable us to expand into new geographies and further increase our sales to large enterprise customers 
we plan to continue investing in our domestic and international marketing activities to help build brand awareness and create sales leads for our channel partners 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars and remain our largest operating expense category 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily relate to our executive  finance  human resources  legal and information technology organizations 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  professional fees for legal  accounting  tax  compliance and information systems  travel  recruiting expense  software amortization costs  depreciation expense and facilities expenses 
as we expand our business  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  gains and losses on foreign currency translations and transactions  interest expense on our debt as well as other miscellaneous items affecting our operating results 

table of contents benefit from income taxes 
benefit from income taxes includes federal  state and foreign tax on our income as well as any adjustments made to our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
since our inception  we have accumulated substantial net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax reporting purposes  net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits measured by applying current enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
use of non gaap financial measures we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results may limit the reader s understanding if limited to reviewing only generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures 
many investors and analysts have requested that  in addition to reporting financial information in accordance with gaap that we also disclose certain non gaap information because it is useful in understanding our performance as it excludes non cash and other non recurring charges or credits that many investors and management feel may obscure our true operating performance 
likewise  we use these non gaap financial measures to manage and assess the profitability of the business and determine a portion of our employee compensation 
we do not consider stock based compensation charges  amortization of purchased intangibles  acquisition related costs  severance charges  litigation settlement costs  interest charge from change in fair value of contingent consideration and related tax adjustments non gaap adjustments in managing the core operations 
these measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by gaap and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 
non gaap net income loss is calculated by adjusting gaap net income loss for non gaap adjustments 
non gaap net income loss per share per share is calculated by dividing non gaap net income loss by the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares outstanding for the period 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and because these amounts are not determined in accordance with gaap  they should not be used exclusively in evaluating our business and operations 
we have provided a reconciliation of non gaap financial measures in the following table

we may enter into agreements relating to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses or technologies in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
if needed  additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
we believe that the available amounts under the line of credit together with our cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the following table shows our cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods year ended june  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash flows from operating activities our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our cash expenditures to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development  sales and marketing and administration 
our operating cash flows are also influenced by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory  accounts receivable  vendor accounts payable and other assets and liabilities 
we procure finished goods inventory from our contract manufacturers and typically pay them in days 
we extend credit to our channel partners and typically collect in to days  although these time periods can vary and can be longer 
in some cases  we prepay for license rights to third party products  which we incorporate into our products  in advance of such sales

these amounts were partially offset by increases in prepaid expenses of million  an increase in inventories of million  an increase in other assets of million and a decrease in accrued liabilities of million 
cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by million in fiscal  primarily due to higher spending to support our growth  an increase in inventory  as well as factors related to timing of payments of our liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities consisted of a net loss of million  adjusted by non cash items of million and cash used by changes in assets and liabilities of million  which primarily consisted of an increase of million in accounts receivable  attributable to higher revenue in fiscal and timing of cash collections  increase of million in inventory  primarily due to anticipated demand for our solutions in relation to lead times to produce such product by our contract manufacturers  as well as a purposeful build up of inventory to mitigate any supply chain disruption resulting from the natural disaster in japan in march  a combined decrease of million in accounts payable  and accrued liabilities and others  partially offset by an increase of million in deferred revenue  driven by higher post contractual support billings resulting from the increase in our installed base  a decrease of million in prepaid assets and other current assets  reflecting timing of expense recognition and an increase of million in accrued employee compensation 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we may hold investments to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact to our overall liquidity 
net cash flow used in investing activities in fiscal was million and primarily consists of million paid  net of cash received  for our acquisition of m  million used to purchase property  plant and equipment  million used in purchase of investments securities and million used to purchase an intangible asset 
net cash flow provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  primarily comprised of million of proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments  offset by million used in the acquisition of agito  million used to purchase property and equipment  million used to purchase investment securities  and million used to purchase intangible assets 
cash flows from financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities in fiscal was million and primarily consisted of million borrowings in from the line of credit net of repayments made during the period  million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under various employee benefit plans  offset by million used to pay taxes on vested and released stock awards and million of payments made under various capital lease agreements 
cash flow provided by financing activities in fiscal was million which primarily consisted of proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options  offset by million used to pay taxes on vested and released stock awards

see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for a discussion of income taxes 
we contract with independent sources to manufacture our products and purchase components from a variety of suppliers 
during the normal course of business  in order to manage future demand for our products and to ensure adequate component supply  we enter into agreements with manufacturers and suppliers which allow us to procure inventory based upon criteria and timing that we define 
certain of these purchase commitments are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
the purchase consideration for our acquisition of m included a contingent portion ranging from zero to million and is subject to the achievement of certain revenue targets 
if these revenue targets are met in full  we will pay the million in cash over the next two years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition of m 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed above within contractual obligations nor do we have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  the disclosure of contingencies as of the dates of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain revenue recognition  stock based compensation  goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected

revenue recognition we derive our revenue from the sale of premise enterprise ip telecommunications systems and shoretel sky hosted services 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
asu  which amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in addition  in october  the fasb issued asu  which i provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among its elements  ii require an entity to allocate the revenue using estimated selling prices esp of the deliverables if there is no vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
for a multiple element transaction  the total arrangement fees are allocated to all the deliverables based on their respective relative selling prices 
the relative selling price is determined using vsoe when available 
when vsoe cannot be established  the company attempts to determine the tpe for the deliverables 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately by the competitors 
generally our product offerings differ from those of our competitors and comparable pricing of our competitors is often not available 
therefore  we are typically not able to determine tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement fees 
the esp for a deliverable is determined as the price at which we would transact if the products or services were sold on a stand alone basis 
for transactions entered into prior to july   we recognized revenue based on industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in accordance with industry specific software revenue recognition guidance  we utilized the residual method to determine the amount of product revenue to be recognized 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements  such as post contractual support  is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration is recognized as product revenue 
vsoe of fair value is limited to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
vsoe of fair value is established for post contractual support based on the volume and pricing of the stand alone sales within a narrow range 
the fair value of the post contractual support is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related support period  which is typically one to five years 

table of contents premise revenues the sale of ip telecommunication systems include hardware  primarily phones and voice switches  software components and may also include training  installation and post contractual support for the products 
our business strategy is centered on selling to enterprise customers through channel partners rather than directly 
sales to value added distributors allows us to leverage our existing distribution infrastructure and sales personnel 
in some instances  larger enterprise customers prefer to purchase directly from us 
many of these large account sales are channel partner assisted and we compensate the channel partner in much the same way as if the channel partner had made the sale directly 
the compensation to the channel partner is recorded as an offset to the revenues associated with the direct sale to the enterprise customer 
the typical system includes a combination of ip phones  switches and software applications 
for sales transactions made both directly and to resellers revenue is recognized at the time of shipment provided that all the provisions of revenue recognition have been met 
for sales to value added distributors  revenue is initially deferred and is recognized at the time of sale by the distributor to their customer  provided all the provisions of revenue recognition have been met 
we refer to this distribution approach as two tier distribution model and the recognition of revenue at the time of sale by the distributor as the sell through method 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product has shipped or delivery has occurred depending on when title passes  the sales price is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
the fee is considered fixed or determinable at the execution of an agreement  based on specific products and quantities to be delivered at specified prices 
the agreements with reseller partners generally do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
even though substantially all of the contractual agreements do not provide return privileges  there are circumstances for which we will accept a return 
we maintain a reserve for such returns based on historical experience with reseller partners 
the agreements with our value added distributors allow for limited rights of return of products generally purchased within the previous days 
in addition to such return rights  we generally offer price protection provisions to our distributors when there is a permanent reduction of our sales prices 
in such cases  we are obligated to grant the distributor a credit for the difference between the change in the aggregate price of any amounts that have been purchased but unsold by the distributor as of the effective date of such decrease 
to the extent that our agreements contain acceptance terms  we recognize revenue upon product acceptance  unless the acceptance provision is deemed to be perfunctory 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to net days 
in the event payment terms are extended materially from the company s standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payment becomes due 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
provisions for return allowances and product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical experience 
the provision for return allowances is recorded as a reduction to revenues on the statement of operations and is included as a reduction to accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
most of the products and services included in a premise system qualify as separate units of accounting 
many of our products have both software and non software components that function together to deliver the essential functionality of the integrated system product 
we analyze all of our software and non software products and services and consider the features and functionalities of the individual elements and the stand alone sales of those individual components among other factors  to determine which elements are essential or non essential to the overall functionality of the integrated system product 
we recognize revenue related to installation services and training upon delivery of the service 
our core software  which we refer to as essential software  is integrated with hardware and is essential to the functionality of the integrated system product 
we also sell additional software which provides increased features and functions  but is not essential to the overall functionality of the integrated system products  which we refer to as non essential software 
at the initial purchase  the customer generally bundles together the hardware  essential software  non essential software  as needed  and up to five years of post contractual support 
thereafter  if the enterprise customer increases end users and functionality  it may add more hardware  both essential and non essential software components  and related post contractual support by purchasing them separately the revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the non essential software deliverables and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the new revenue accounting guidance 
the non essential software deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement are subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
as we have not been able to obtain vsoe for all of the non essential software deliverables in the arrangement  revenue allocated to the delivered non essential software elements is recognized using the residual method in accordance with industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue recognized for the delivered non essential software elements equaled the total allocated consideration less the vsoe of any undelivered elements bundled with such non essential software elements 

table of contents we have been able to establish vsoe for our professional and post contractual support services mainly based on the volume and the pricing of the stand alone sales for these services within a narrow range 
we establish our esp for products by considering factors including  but not limited to  geographies  customer segments and pricing practices 
the determination of esp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management 
we regularly review vsoe  tpe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
we have arrangements with our channel partners under which we reimburse them for cooperative marketing costs meeting specified criteria 
the reimbursements are limited to of the actual costs charged to the channel partners by third party vendors for advertising  trade show activities and other related sales and marketing activities for which we receive an identifiable benefit goods and services that we could have purchased directly from third party vendors  subject to a limit of the total cooperative marketing allowance earned by each channel partner 
we record the reimbursements to the channel partners meeting such specified criteria within sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations  and maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs 
hosted revenues our hosted services and solutions consist primarily of our proprietary hosted voip unified communications system as well as other services such as foreign and domestic calling plans  certain uc applications  internet service provisioning  training and other professional services 
additionally  we offer our customers the ability to purchases phone systems from us directly or rent such systems as part of their service agreements 
customers are not required to purchase phones from us directly as they can independently purchase such equipment 
our customers typically enter into a month service agreement whereby they are billed for such services on a monthly basis 
monthly recurring hosted services are recognized on a straight line basis in the period when the service is delivered 
the installation fees are recognized based on customer contractual period or on a straight line basis over the estimated customer life 
we bill most of the monthly recurring hosted service revenue a month in advance 
any amounts billed and collected  but for which the service is not yet delivered  are included in deferred revenue 
these amounts are recognized as revenues only when the service is delivered 
we maintain a reserve for credits provided to customers for outages  quality issues  billing disputes or changes in the service levels that are included in the amounts that were billed in advance 
the reserve for such credits is based on historical experiences and trends 
we also maintain a reserve for amounts that are deemed as uncollectible 
stock based compensation we measure all share based payments to employees based on the grant date fair value of the awards and recognize these amounts in our consolidated statement of operations over the period during which the employee is required to perform services in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
we amortize the fair value of share based payments on a straight line basis 
we have never capitalized stock based employee compensation cost 
income tax benefits realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing activity 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations has been reduced for forfeitures since it is based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our option pricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates  the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis on june th and  when specific circumstances dictate  between annual tests 
when impaired  the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step  identifying a potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step would need to be conducted  otherwise  no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists 
the second step  measuring the impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss 
there was no impairment of goodwill identified in fiscal   or purchased intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the periods of benefit  ranging from two to eight years 
we perform a review of purchased intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if such facts and circumstances exist  we assess the recoverability of purchased intangible assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairments  if any  are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
if the useful life of the asset is shorter than originally estimated  we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life 
there was no impairment of purchased intangible assets identified in fiscal   or 
table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit of which future realization is uncertain 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is based on several factors  including our past earnings and the scheduling of deferred taxes and projected income from operating activities 
during fiscal the company released million of valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to the m acquisition  since the amortization of the acquired identifiable intangible property upon which a deferred tax liability was established will provide sufficient future taxable income to enable a partial realization of the company s deferred tax assets 
except for the aforementioned valuation allowance release  as of june   we do not believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets relating to us federal and state operations are realizable 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance 
our income tax benefit recorded in the future will be reduced or increased in the event changes to the valuation allowance are required

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in foreign currencies 
we are primarily exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to collections from accounts receivable balances and cash in banks that are denominated in australian dollar  british pound and the euro 
during the year ended june   we used derivative instruments to reduce the volatility of earnings associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we used foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the gains and losses generated from the re measurement of certain foreign monetary assets and liabilities  primarily including cash balances  third party accounts receivable and intercompany transactions recorded on the balance sheet 
these derivatives are not designated and do not qualify as hedge instruments 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in other income and expenses during the period of change 
as of june   a change in the applicable foreign exchange rates would result in an immaterial increase or decrease in our pretax earnings 
in addition  we currently hold our investment portfolio in accounts with three financial firms 
while we do not invest our cash in obligations of these firms  if these firms were to experience financial or other regulatory difficulties  it might be difficult for us to access our investments in a timely manner 
interest rate risk our exposure to the interest rate risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates is due to both our cash equivalents and short term investments and our indebtedness 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material positive impact on interest earnings for our portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical change in fair values in the financial instruments we held at june  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio  which had a fair value of million at june  market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus  and basis points
