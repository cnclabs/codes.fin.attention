table of contents non gaap financial measures the company supplements its disclosures made in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap with certain non gaap financial measures 
the company does not  and does not suggest investors should  consider such non gaap financial measures in isolation from  or as a substitute for  us gaap financial information 
these non gaap measures may not be consistent with the presentation by similar companies in the company s industry 
whenever the company uses such non gaap measures  it provides a reconciliation of such measures to the most closely applicable gaap measure 
with over percent of sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  management uses currency adjusted growth  and believes it is useful to investors  to judge the company s local currency performance 
organic sales growth data presented herein excludes currency impacts  and where indicated  acquisition impacts 
the company calculates the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by multiplying current period activity by the difference between current period exchange rates and prior period exchange rates  the result is the defined impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in fx 
while we are able to report currency impacts after the fact  we are unable to estimate changes that may occur in to applicable exchange rates 
any significant changes in currency exchange rates would likely have a significant impact on our reported growth rates due to the volume of our sales denominated in foreign currencies 
management also uses free cash flow  a non gaap measure  to judge its performance and ability to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures 
management believes this non gaap information is useful to investors as well 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the years presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventories on hand and records a provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory  inventory not meeting quality standards and inventory subject to expiration 
the provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory is based on current estimates of future product demand  market conditions and related management judgment 
any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions that vary from current expectations could have an impact on the value of inventories 
long lived assets 
long lived assets  including intangibles with definite lives  are amortized over their expected useful lives 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized against earnings 
goodwill is assessed annually for impairment 
all long lived assets are assessed whenever events and changes in business conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if impairment is indicated  the asset value is written down to its fair market value 
any significant unanticipated changes in business or market conditions that vary from current expectations could have an impact on the fair value of these assets and a potential associated impairment 
the company was not at risk of failing the impairment test as of december  pension and other post retirement benefits 
the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries to calculate such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note pension and other post retirement
