table of contents part i item business we operate a global commercial wireless messaging system optimized for narrowband communications 
our system consists of a global network of low earth orbit  or leo  satellites  microsatellites and accompanying ground infrastructure 
our first generation satellites are the core of a two way communications system that enables our customers and end users  to track  monitor  control and communicate cost effectively with fixed and mobile assets located anywhere in the world  and microsatellites that only provide worldwide ship tracking capability using the automatic identification system ais technology already installed on large ocean going vessels 
we have agreements with another satellite provider to resell their satellite services as well 
we also provide terrestrial based cellular communication services through reseller agreements with major cellular wireless providers 
currently  our agreements with major cellular providers include gsm and cdma offerings in the united states and gsm services with significant coverage worldwide 
these terrestrial based communication services enable our customers who have higher bandwidth requirements to receive and send messages from communication devices based on terrestrial based technologies using the cellular providers wireless networks as well as from dual mode devices combining the technologies from our satellite subscriber communicators and terrestrial based technologies 
as a result  our customers are now able to integrate into their applications communication technologies that will allow them to send and receive messages  including data intensive messaging using the cellular providers wireless networks and our satellite network 
our products and services enable our customers and end users to enhance productivity  reduce costs and improve security through a variety of commercial  government  and emerging homeland security applications 
we enable our customers and end users to achieve these benefits on a world wide basis by using a single global satellite technology standard for machine to machine and telematic  or mm  data communications  as well providing the benefits of using terrestrial based cellular systems 
our customers have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
examples of assets that are connected through our mm data communications system include trucks  trailers  railcars  containers  heavy equipment  fluid tanks  utility meters  pipeline monitoring equipment  marine vessels  oil and gas wells and irrigation control systems 
customers benefiting from our network include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as caterpillar  komatsu  doosan infracore america  hitachi  hyundai heavy industries  the manitowoc company and volvo construction equipment 
in addition  we market our services through a distribution network of vertical market technology integrators known as vars and ivars  such as id systems  inc  xata corporation and american innovations  ltd 
on may  we expanded our business with the purchase of certain assets from alanco technologies  inc and on january  we further expanded our business with the purchase of certain assets from par technology inc the acquired assets enable customers to proactively monitor  manage and remotely control their refrigerated and other transport assets using complete end to end solutions 
these solutions enable optimal business efficiencies  increased asset utilization  and substantially reduce asset write offs and manual yard counts of chassis  refrigeration units  containers and generators gensets 
through increased asset visibility and management  these solutions allow shipping  rail  and leasing companies to decrease their fleet sizes of chassis  gensets  refrigeration units and containers 
the information provided from these solutions also help industry leaders realize better fleet efficiency and utilization while reducing risk by adding safety monitoring of perishable cargo 
in addition to relationships with leading refrigerated unit manufacturers such as carrier and thermo king  the acquired assets include customers with well known brands such as tropicana  maersk line  prime inc  cr england  ffe transport  inc  target  chiquita  ryder  jb hunt  hapag lloyd  golden state foods  martin brower and exel transportation 
these acquisitions enable us to create a global technology platform to transfer capabilities across new and existing vertical markets and deliver complementary products to our channel partners and resellers worldwide 
the ais microsatellites we operate provide what we believe is the most comprehensive global ais data service to government and commercial customers to track over  ocean going vessels worldwide 
ais is a 
table of contents shipboard broadcast system that transmits a vessel s identification and position to aid navigation and improve maritime safety 
terrestrial based ais receivers provide only limited visibility of ships close to shore and are not able to provide global visibility of ship traffic with open ocean coverage 
using our satellite communications system  customers have access to ais data well beyond coastal regions in a cost effective and timely fashion 
further  we intend to continue working with system integrators and maritime information service providers providing value added services to facilitate the sales and distribution of ais data 
we will continue to work to address and expand the various market sectors that could benefit from access to ais data  such as suppliers to the shipping sector  like traders  brokers  insurance companies and support services 
an additional potential benefit of ais is the ability to combine ais data with asset tracking and monitoring solutions 
we believe this creates the potential to provide complete end to end visibility of the shipment of goods throughout the global supply chain from an integrated information solution 
this solution  once fully integrated into transportation management systems  has the potential to track and monitor individual shipping containers through the intermodal transportation system from origination to destination as it is transported on truck  rail and ship 
through our mm data satellite communications system  our customers and end users can send and receive information to and from any place in the world using low cost subscriber communicators and paying airtime costs that we believe are the lowest in the industry for global connectivity 
our customers can also use cellular terrestrial units  or wireless subscriber identity modules sims  for use with devices or equipment that enable the use of a cellular provider s wireless network  singularly or in conjunction with satellite services  to send and receive information from these devices 
we believe that there is no other satellite or terrestrial network currently in operation that can offer global two way wireless narrowband data service including coverage at comparable cost using a single technology standard worldwide  that also provides a parallel terrestrial network for data intensive applications 
we are currently authorized  either directly or indirectly  to provide our satellite communications services in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa and australia 
presently our unique mm data communications system is comprised of four components i our constellation of owned leo satellites in multiple orbital planes between and miles above the earth operating in the very high frequency  or vhf  radio frequency spectrum  and leased ais micro satellites in perpendicular orbital planes one polar plane and one equatorial plane  ii a network of related ground infrastructure  including gateway earth stations  two ais data reception earth stations with a third ais data reception earth station under construction  three regional gateway control centers and a network control center in dulles  virginia including a redundant backup control center in the state of washington  through which data sent to and from satellite subscriber communicators are routed  including a communications node for terrestrial services through which data sent to and from terrestrial units are routed  iii a subscriber component  which consists of satellite subscriber communicators  and cellular terrestrial units or wireless modems incorporating sims  used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and our system  and iv end user integration in which specialized data feeds are established through our application gateway interface to third party dispatch systems and proprietary customer software applications 
see the orbcomm communications system 
as of december   we had approximately  billable subscriber communicators compared to approximately  billable subscriber communicators as of december   an increase of 
billable subscriber communicators are defined as subscriber communicators that are shipped and activated for usage and billing at the request of the customer  without forecasting a timeframe for when individual units will be generating usage and billing 
it includes terrestrial as well as satellite units 
our business strengths and competitive advantage we believe that our focus on mm data communications is unique in our industry and will enable us to achieve significant growth 
we believe no other satellite or terrestrial network currently in operation offers users 
table of contents global two way wireless narrowband data communications using a single global technology standard anywhere in the world at costs comparable to ours and  that also provides a parallel terrestrial network for data intensive applications 
we also believe that our combination of communications services  including our own network of leo satellites and supporting ground infrastructure  as well as our ais data service and our transportation management solutions provide orbcomm a unique position in the emerging mm  telematics and global supply chain management businesses 
this provides us with a number of competitive advantages that we believe will help promote our success  including the following established global satellite network and proven technology 
we believe our global satellite network and technology enable us to offer superior products and services to the end users of our communications system in terms of comprehensive coverage  reliability and compatibility 
our global satellite network provides worldwide coverage  including in international waters  allowing end users to access our communications system in areas outside the coverage of terrestrial networks  such as cellular  paging  and other wireless networks 
our proven technology offers full two way mm data communication with acknowledgement of message receipt with minimal line of sight limitations and no performance issues during adverse weather conditions  which distinguishes us from other satellite communications systems 
our primary satellite orbital planes contain five to eight satellites each providing built in system redundancies in the event of a single satellite malfunction 
in addition  our satellite system uses a single global technology standard and eliminates the need for multiple network agreements and versions of hardware and software 
finally  orbcomm s technology expansion and enhancements are designed to be backwards compatible and not susceptible to technology migrations and network sunsetting that has  in the past  rendered other network communications devices obsolete 
low cost structure 
we have a significant cost advantage over any potential new leo satellite system competitor with respect to our current satellite constellation  because we acquired the majority of our current network assets from orbcomm global lp  referred to as the predecessor company  and its subsidiaries out of bankruptcy for a fraction of their original cost 
in addition  because our leo satellites are relatively small and deployed into low earth orbit  the replenishment of the constellation is less expensive and easier to launch and maintain than larger leo satellites and large geostationary satellites 
we believe that we have less complex and less costly ground infrastructure and subscriber communication equipment than other satellite communications providers 
our low cost satellite system architecture enables us to provide global two way wireless narrowband data communication services to end users at prices that we believe are the lowest in the industry for global connectivity 
sole commercial satellite operator licensed in the vhf spectrum 
we are the sole commercial satellite operator licensed to operate in the mhz vhf spectrum by the fcc or  to our knowledge  any other national spectrum or radio telecommunications regulatory agency in the world 
the spectrum that we use was allocated globally by the international telecommunication union  or itu  for use by satellite fleets such as ours to provide mobile data communications service 
we are currently authorized  either directly or indirectly  to provide our data communications service in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  and australia 
vhf spectrum has inherent advantages for mm data communications over systems using shorter wavelength signals 
the vhf signals used to communicate between our satellites and subscriber communicators are not affected by weather and are less dependent on line of sight access to our satellites than other satellite communications systems 
in addition  our longer wavelength signals enable our satellites to communicate reliably over longer distances at lower power levels 
higher power requirements of commercial satellite systems in other spectrum bands are a significant factor in their higher cost and technical complexity 
significant market lead over satellite based competitors 
we believe that we have a significant market lead in providing mm data communications services that meet the coverage and cost requirements in the rapidly developing asset management and supply chain markets 
the process required to establish a new competing satellite based system with the advantages of a vhf system includes obtaining regulatory permits to launch and operate satellites and to provide communications services  and the design  development  construction and launch of a communications system 
we believe that a minimum of five 
table of contents years and significant investments in time and resources would be required for another satellite based mm data communications service provider to develop the capability to offer comparable services 
additionally  our vars and ivars have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications which also often require substantial lead time to develop 
key distribution and oem customer relationships 
our strategic relationships with key distributors and oems have enabled us to streamline our sales and distribution channels and shift much of the risk and cost of developing and marketing applications to others 
we have established strategic relationships with key service providers  such as id systems asset intelligence  xata corporation  a leading provider of tracking solutions for the trucking industry  including to penske corporation  the leading truck leasing company in the united states  and major oems  such as caterpillar  hitachi  komatsu  and volvo 
we believe our close relationships with these distributors and oems allows us to work closely with them at all stages of application development  from planning and design through implementation of our mm data communications services  and to benefit from their industry specific expertise 
by fostering these strong relationships with distributors and oems  we believe that once we have become so integrated into our customer s planning  development  and implementation process  and their equipment  we anticipate it will be more difficult to displace us or our communication services 
in addition  the fixed and mobile assets which are tracked  monitored  controlled  and communicated with by these customers generally have long useful lives and the cost of replacing our communications equipment with an alternative service provider s equipment could be prohibitive for a large numbers of assets 
reliable  low cost subscriber communicators 
there are currently two independent third party manufacturers that build subscriber communicators for our network quake global  inc quake and digi international inc digi 
the cost of communications components necessary for our subscriber communicators to operate in the vhf band is relatively low as they are based on readily available fm radio components 
dual mode devices are being built that combine other communication technologies with satellite technology and will be offered to the market at what we believe will be competitive prices 
solutions and technology provider 
we can provide customers with complete end to end solutions focused on cold chain management to proactively monitor  manage and remotely control refrigerated transport assets using cellular and satellite wireless technology 
these solutions can be used by customers to monitor and control other non refrigerated transportation and intermodal assets 
these solutions can also be used by us to create a global technology platform to transfer capabilities across new and existing vertical markets and deliver complementary products to our channel partners and resellers worldwide 
we believe this will help drive new subscribers to our global communications network 
we also expect to leverage these capabilities with other resellers to continue to drive down development cycle time and enhance the end user experience  and build on benefits from our new satellite constellation 
our strategy our strategy is to leverage our business strengths and key competitive advantages to increase the number of  and revenue generated by  subscriber communicators activated on our mm data communications system  both in existing and new markets 
we believe that the service revenue associated with each additional subscriber communicator activated on our communications system will more than offset the low incremental cost of adding such subscriber communicator to our system and  as a result  positively impact our results of operations 
we also provide services through major cellular providers reseller agreements allowing customers to utilize other networks offering gsm and cdma technologies to be integrated into their applications 
we plan to continue to target multinational companies and government agencies to increase our penetration of what we believe is a significant and growing addressable market 
additionally  we will continue our efforts to expand our ais satellite service customer base in the near term in order to capitalize on our satellite based system for ais services 
to achieve our objectives  we are pursuing the following business strategies expand our low cost  multi channel marketing and distribution network of resellers 
we intend to increase further the number of resellers that develop  market and implement their applications together 
table of contents with our communications services and subscriber communicators to end users 
we are also focused on increasing the number of oem and distributor relationships with leading companies that own  manage  or operate fixed or mobile assets 
we are seeking to recruit resellers with industry knowledge to develop applications that could be used for industries or markets that we do not currently serve 
resellers invest their own capital developing applications compatible with our system  and they typically act as their own agents and systems integrators when marketing these applications to end users  without the need for significant investment by us 
as a result  we have established a low cost marketing and distribution model that is both easily scalable by adding resellers or large scale asset deployers  and allows us to penetrate markets without incurring substantial research and development costs or sales and marketing costs 
expand our international markets 
our international growth strategy is to open new markets outside the united states by obtaining regulatory authorizations and developing markets for our mm data communications services to be sold in regions where the market opportunity for our oem customers and resellers is greatest 
we are currently authorized to provide our data communications services in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  and australia  directly or indirectly through our multiple international licensees and country representatives 
we are currently working with ivars who  generally  subject to certain regulatory restrictions  have the right to market and sell their applications anywhere our communications services are offered 
we seek to enter into agreements with strong distributors in each region 
our regional distributors  which include subsidiary companies  country representatives and international licensees  obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations and develop local markets directly or by recruiting local vars 
in some international markets where distribution channels are in the early stages of development  we seek to bring together vars who have developed well tested applications with local distributors to create localized solutions and accelerate the adoption of our mm data communications services 
in addition  we have made efforts to strengthen the financial positions of certain of our regional distributors  including several who were former licensees of the predecessor company left weakened by its bankruptcy  through restructuring transactions whereby we obtained greater operating control over such regional distributors 
we believe that by strengthening the financial condition of  and our operating control over  these established regional distributors  they will be better positioned to promote and distribute our products and services and enable us to achieve our market potential in the relevant regions 
further reduce subscriber communicator costs and improve functionality of communicators 
we are working with our subscriber communicator manufacturers to further reduce the cost of our subscriber communicators  as well as to develop technological advances  including further reductions in size  improvements in power management efficiency  increased reliability  and enhanced capabilities to capitalize on our investment in our next generation satellites 
our ability to offer our customers less expensive subscriber communicators that are smaller  more efficient and more reliable is key to our ability to provide a complete low cost solution to our customers and end users 
additionally  some suppliers have been developing a dual mode device that will allow customers to integrate both a satellite and terrestrial communication component into a single device 
reduce network latency 
we expect to reduce the time lags in delivering messages and data  or network latency  in most regions of the world following the successful launch of our next generation satellites 
we believe this will improve the quality and coverage of our system and enable us to increase our customer base 
introduce new features and services 
we will continue to develop and introduce new features and services to expand our customer base and increase our revenues 
for example  as a result of providing terrestrial based cellular communication services  our customers are now able to integrate in their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from combined satellite and cellular technologies 
we have upgraded the technology capabilities of our network operations center to deliver both satellite and terrestrial messages through our ground infrastructure to the ultimate destination 
we believe that subscriber communicator technology advances  such as dual mode devices  will broaden our addressable market by providing attractive combinations of bandwidth and coverage at a reasonable price 
dual mode devices combine a satellite subscriber communicator with a cellular network subscriber communicator for higher bandwidth 
table of contents applications not typical of orbcomm s applications 
dual mode devices can also be used as a back channel service for terrestrial or satellite based broadcast only networks 
expand ais services 
the two ais microsatellites we operate have been providing full commercial ais data service to us since december and february in addition  all of our next generation satellites currently under construction will have ais capability 
ais is a shipboard broadcast system that transmits a vessel s identification and position to aid navigation and improve maritime safety 
current terrestrial based ais systems provide only limited shore coverage and are not able to provide global open ocean coverage 
using our satellite communications system  customers have access to ais data with coverage over open oceans well beyond coastal regions in a cost effective and timely fashion 
further  we intend to continue working with system integrators and maritime information service providers for value added service and to facilitate the sales and distribution of ais data 
we will continue to work with additional candidates to address the various market sectors for ais data 
provide comprehensive technical support  customer service and quality control 
we provide our customers support for training  integration and testing in order to assist our vars and other distributors in the roll out of their applications and to enhance end user acquisition and retention 
we provide our var and oem customers with access to customer support technicians 
we also deploy our technicians to our var and oem customers to facilitate the integration of our mm data communications system with their applications during the planning  development and implementation processes and to certify that these applications are compatible with our system 
our support personnel include professionals with application development  in house laboratory  and hardware design and testing capabilities 
providing solutions and reducing time to market with technology investments 
we invest in products and services to provide customers with complete end to end solutions to proactively monitor  manage and remotely control their refrigerated and other transport assets 
we intend to market the services through direct and indirect sales channels as well as leverage our international distribution channels to introduce these solutions to markets outside of north america  greatly expanding the addressable market reach 
we will continue to invest in the products and services to further our competitive technology advantage in asset management solutions and leverage our relationships  scale and purchasing volumes to improve manufacturing efficiencies and reduce costs 
we endeavor to use these solutions and subsequent investments in solutions and communications technology to create global technologies that can be transferred across new and existing vertical markets and deliver complementary services and products to our channel partners and resellers worldwide to drive new subscribers to our global communications network 
industry overview increasingly  businesses and governments face the need to track  control  monitor and communicate with fixed and mobile assets that are located throughout the world 
at the same time  these assets increasingly incorporate microprocessors  sensors and other devices that can provide a variety of information about the asset s location  condition  operation and environment and are capable of responding to external commands and queries 
as these intelligent devices proliferate  we believe that the need to establish two way communications with these devices is greater than ever 
the owners and operators of these intelligent devices are seeking low cost and efficient communications systems that will enable them to communicate with these devices 
we operate in the machine to machine and telematics  or mm  industry  which includes various types of communications systems that enable intelligent machines  devices and fixed or mobile assets to communicate information from the machine  device or fixed or mobile asset to and from back office information systems of the businesses and government agencies that track  monitor  control and communicate with them 
these mm data communications systems integrate a number of technologies and cross several different industries  including computer hardware and software systems  positioning systems  terrestrial and satellite communications networks and information technologies such as data hosting and report generation 

table of contents there are three main components in any mm data communications system fixed or mobile assets 
intelligent or trackable assets include devices and sensors that collect  measure  record or otherwise gather data about themselves or their environment to be used  analyzed or otherwise disseminated to other machines  applications or human operators and come in many forms  including devices and sensors that report the location  speed and fuel economy data from trucks and locomotives  monitor the location  condition and environmental factors of trailers  railcars and marine shipping containers  report operating data and usage for heavy equipment  monitor fishing vessels to enforce government regulations regarding geographic and seasonal restrictions  report energy consumption from a utility meter  monitor corrosion in a pipeline  monitor levels in liquid  gas and materials storage tanks  measure water delivery in agricultural pipelines  and monitor environmental conditions in agricultural facilities 
communications network 
the communications network enables a connection to take place between the fixed or mobile asset and the back office systems and users of that asset s data 
the proliferation of terrestrial and satellite based wireless networks has enabled the creation of a variety of mm data communications applications 
networks that are being used to deliver mm data include terrestrial communications networks  such as cellular  radio paging and wifi networks  and satellite communications networks  utilizing low earth orbit or geosynchronous satellites 
back office application or user 
data collected from a remote asset is used in a variety of ways with applications that allow the end user to track  monitor  control and communicate with these assets with a greater degree of control and with much less time and expense than would be required to do so manually 
market opportunity commercial transportation and supply chain management large trucking and trailer leasing companies require applications that report location  engine diagnostic data  driver performance  fuel consumption  compliance  rapid decelerations  fuel taxes  driver logs and zone adherence in order to manage their truck fleets more safely and efficiently and to improve truck and trailer utilization 
truck and trailer fleet owners and operators  as well as truck and trailer oems  are increasingly integrating mm data communications systems into their trucks and trailers 
as trucks and trailer tracking applications phase out the use of older analog cellular wireless networks  end users will need to migrate to alternative communications systems and we expect that an increasing number of customers will be seeking long term solutions for their mm data communications needs as they make their replacement decisions 
trailer tracking represents a significantly larger potential market as we estimate that there are approximately three trailers to every truck 
the trailer market also requires additional applications  such as cargo sensor reporting  load monitoring  control of refrigeration systems and door alarms 
future regulations may require position tracking of specific types of cargo  such as hazardous materials  and could also increase trailer tracking market opportunities 
the railcar market also requires many of these same applications and many trailer applications using mm data communications system can readily be translated to the railcar market 

table of contents shippers and transportation companies which require refrigerated or cold chain transportation capabilities over rail  trucking or sea transport have an increasing need to track and monitor environmental conditions of cargo  and the market opportunity to control and monitor refrigeration systems is an important market 
it is also one that could grow further if future regulations require these capabilities 
heavy equipment heavy equipment fleet owners and leasing companies seeking to improve fleet productivity and profitability require applications that report diagnostic information  location including for purposes of geo fencing  time of use information  emergency notification  driver usage and maintenance alerts for their heavy equipment  which may be geographically dispersed  often in remote  difficult to reach locations 
using mm data communications systems  heavy equipment fleet operators can remotely manage the productivity and mechanical condition of their equipment fleets  potentially lowering operating costs through preventive maintenance 
oems can also use mm applications to better anticipate the maintenance and spare parts needs of their customers  expanding the market for more higher margin spare parts orders for the oems 
heavy equipment oems are increasingly integrating mm data communications systems as standardized into their equipment at the factory or offering them as add on options through certified after market dealers 
since the heavy equipment market is dominated by a small number of oems  mm data communications service providers targeting this market segment focus on building relationships with these oems  such as caterpillar  komatsu  hitachi and volvo 
there are also a number of manufacturers in large underserved markets such as africa  india and china and a number of additional global brands that are being targeted 
these regions countries and brands represent a significant opportunity and orbcomm will continue its efforts to expand its reach by obtaining regulatory approval in additional markets 
fixed asset monitoring companies with widely dispersed fixed assets require a means of collecting data from remote assets to monitor productivity  minimize downtime and realize other operational benefits  as well as managing and controlling the functions of such assets  for example  the remote operation of valves and electrical switches 
mm data communications systems can provide industrial companies with applications for automated meter reading  oil and gas storage tank monitoring  pipeline monitoring and environmental monitoring  which can reduce operating costs for these companies  including labor costs  fuel costs  and the expense of on site monitoring and maintenance 
electrical grid monitoring utilities are increasingly investing in efforts to better monitor power generation assets and distribution systems to protect assets and improve efficiency in power generation and delivery 
this could represent a significant opportunity particularly with increased bandwidth through dual mode capabilities 
marine vessels marine vessels have a need for satellite based communications due to the absence of reliable terrestrial based coverage more than a few miles offshore 
mm data communications systems may offer features and functions to luxury recreational marine vessels and commercial fishing vessels  such as onboard diagnostics and other marine telematics  alarms  requests for assistance  security  location reporting and tracking  two way messaging  catch data and weather reports 
in addition  owners and operators of commercial fishing and other marine vessels are increasingly subject to regulations governing  among other things  commercial fishing seasons and geographic limitations  vessel tracking  safety systems  and resource management and protection using various mm communications systems 

table of contents government and homeland security governments worldwide are seeking to address the global terror threat by monitoring land borders and hazardous materials  as well as marine vessels and containers 
in addition  modern military and public safety forces use a variety of applications  particularly in supply chain management  logistics and support  which could incorporate our products and services 
mm communications systems can be used in applications to address infiltration across land borders  for example  monitoring seismic sensors placed along the border to detect incursions 
increasingly  there is a need to monitor maritime vessels for homeland security and mm data communications systems could be used in applications to address homeland security requirements  such as tracking and monitoring these vessels and containers 
we expect to leverage our investment in ais technology to resell ais data collected by our network to other maritime services and governmental agencies which had been interrupted with the loss of our last quick launch satellite towards the end of the fourth quarter of further expansion of the ais business had been driven by our ais distribution agreements for commercial purposes  with resellers which are being reestablished with the successful deployment of the two new ais microsatellites 
we will continue to seek to expand our commercial activities with additional distribution partners in the future 
consumer transportation automotive companies are seeking a means to address the growing need for safety systems in passenger vehicles and to broadcast a single message to multiple vehicles at one time 
within the automotive market  there is no single communications technology that satisfies the need for coverage  high reliability and low cost 
an example of an automotive safety application is a system that has the ability to detect and report the deployment of a vehicle s airbag  triggering the dispatch of an ambulance  tow truck or other necessary response personnel 
the terrestrial cellular communications systems currently employed have substantial dead zones  where network coverage is not available  and are difficult to manage globally 
with emerging technology  satellite based automotive safety systems may be able to provide near real time message delivery with minimal network latencies  thereby providing a viable alternative to cellular based systems 
while our system currently has latency limitations which make it impractical for us to address this market fully  we believe that our existing network may be used with dual mode devices  combining our subscriber communicators with communications devices for cellular networks  allowing our communications services to function as an effective back up system by filling the coverage gaps in current cellular or wireless networks used in consumer transportation applications 
in addition  we may undertake additional capital expenditures beyond our current capital plan in order to expand our satellite constellation and lower our latencies to the level that addresses the requirements of resellers and oems developing applications for this market if we believe the economic returns justify such an investment 
we believe we can supplement our satellite constellation within the lead time required to integrate applications using our communications service into the automotive oem product development cycle 
products and services our principal products and services are satellite based data communications services and product sales from subscriber communicators 
we also provide terrestrial based cellular communications services  which consist of reselling airtime using cellular providers wireless technology networks  and product sales from cellular wireless sims for use with devices or equipment that enable the use of the cellular providers wireless networks for data communications 
our communications services are used by businesses and government agencies that are engaged in tracking  monitoring  controlling  or communicating with fixed or mobile assets globally 
low cost  industrially rated subscriber communicators are embedded into many different assets for use with our system 
these products and services are combined with industry or customer specific applications developed by our vars  which are sold to their end user customers 

table of contents for our satellite based data and terrestrial based cellular communications services  we market to end users directly as well as utilize a cost effective sales and marketing strategy of partnering with resellers such as vars  ivars and country representatives 
these resellers  which are our direct customers  market to end users 
satellite communications services we provide global two way mm data communications services through our satellite based system 
we focus our communications services on narrowband data applications 
these data messages are typically sent by a remote subscriber communicator through our satellite system to our ground facilities for forwarding through an appropriate terrestrial communications network to the ultimate destination 
our system  typically combined with industry or customer specific applications developed by our resellers  permits a wide range of fixed and mobile assets to be tracked  monitored  controlled  and communicated with from a central point 
we derive subscription based recurring revenue from our resellers typically based upon the number of subscriber communicators activated on  and the amount of data transmitted through  our communications system 
customers pay a range of monthly service charges to access our communications system generally in addition to a one time provisioning fee  which we believe are the lowest price points in the market 
we also resell satellite services provided by a large geostationary satellite provider 
terrestrial cellular communication services these communication services include gsm and cdma offerings that support higher bandwidth applications that are not typical for an orbcomm satellite application 
these data messages are sent by sims  which are routed through the cellular providers wireless networks to our ground facilities and forwarded to the ultimate destination in real time 
we derive subscription based recurring revenue from resellers typically based upon the number of sims activated on  and the amount of data transmitted through  the cellular providers wireless networks 
customers pay a range of monthly service charges to access our communications system generally in addition to a one time provisioning fee 
satellite ais data services ais is a shipboard broadcast system that transmits a vessel s identification and position to aid navigation and improve maritime safety 
the international maritime organization has mandated the use of ais on all safety of life at sea solas vessels  which are vessels over tons 
current terrestrial based ais systems provide only limited shore based coverage and are not able to provide global open ocean coverage

subscriber communicators our subsidiaries orbcomm japan and startrak  market and sell subscriber communicators directly to our customers 
we also earn a one time royalty fee from third parties for the use of our proprietary communications protocol  which enables subscriber communicators to connect to our mm data communications system 
to ensure the availability of subscriber communicators having different functional capabilities in sufficient quantities to meet demand  we have provided extensive design specifications and technical and engineering support to our manufacturers 
in addition  because we maintain backwards compatibility  subscriber communicators produced by former manufacturers are still in use with our system today 
wireless subscriber identity modules sims our subsidiary  orbcomm terrestrial llc  markets and sells cellular wireless subscriber identity modules  or sims  which are purchased from the cellular wireless providers and sold to resellers

table of contents sales  marketing and distribution we generally market our satellite and terrestrial communications services through resellers ie  vars and internationally through ivars  international licensees and country representatives 
the following chart shows how our low cost  multi channel distribution network is structured logo vars and ivars 
we are currently working with a number of vars and ivars and seek to continue to increase the number of our vars and ivars as we expand our business 
the role of the var or ivar is to develop tailored applications that utilize our system and then market these applications  through non exclusive licenses  to specific  targeted vertical markets 
vars and ivars are responsible for establishing retail pricing  collecting airtime revenue from end users and for providing customer service and support to end users 
our relationship with a var or ivar may be direct or indirect and may be governed by a reseller agreement between us  the international licensee or country representative  on the one hand  and the var or ivar on the other hand  that establishes the var s or ivar s responsibilities with respect to the business  as well as the cost of satellite service to the var or ivar 
vars and ivars are responsible for their own development and sales costs 
vars and ivars typically have unique industry knowledge  which permits them to develop applications targeted for a particular industry or market 
our vars and ivars have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
these applications often require significant time and financial investment to develop for commercial use 
by leveraging these investments  we are able to minimize our own research and development costs  increase the scale of our business without increasing overhead and diversify our business risk among many sales channels 
vars and ivars pay fees for access to our system based on the number of subscriber communicators they have activated on the network and on the amount of data transmitted 
vars and ivars are also generally required to pay a one time fee for each subscriber communicator activated on our system and for other administrative charges 
vars and ivars then typically bill end users based upon the full value of the application and are responsible for customer care to the end user 
generally  subject to certain regulatory restrictions  the ivar arrangement allows us to enter into a single agreement with any given ivar and allows the ivars to pay directly to us a single price on a single monthly invoice in a single currency for worldwide service  regardless of the territories they are selling into  thereby avoiding the need to negotiate prices with individual international licensees and country representatives 
we pay our international licensees and country representatives a commission on revenues received from ivars from each subscriber communicator activated in a specific territory 
the terms of our reseller agreements with ivars typically provide for a three year initial term that is renewable for additional three year terms 
under these agreements  the ivar is responsible for promoting their applications in their respective territory  providing sales forecasts and provisioning information to us  collecting airtime revenue from end users and paying invoices rendered by us 
in addition  ivars are responsible for providing customer support 
international licensees and country representatives 
we generally market and distribute our services outside the united states and canada primarily through international licensees and country representatives 
we 
table of contents rely on these third parties to establish business in their respective territories  including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals  as well as managing local vars 
in addition  we believe that our international licensees and country representatives  through their local expertise  are able to operate in these territories in a more efficient and cost effective manner 
we currently have agreements covering over countries and territories through our multiple international licensees and country representatives 
as we seek to expand internationally  we expect to continue to enter into agreements with additional international licensees and country representatives  particularly in asia and africa 
international licensees and country representatives are generally required to make the system available in their designated regions to vars and ivars 
in territories with multiple countries  it is typical for our international licensees to appoint country representatives 
country representatives are sub licensees within the territory 
they perform tasks assigned by the international licensee 
in return  the international licensees are responsible for  among other things  obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to provide our services in their designated regions  marketing and distributing our services in such regions and could include maintaining the necessary gateway earth stations within their designated regions 
country representatives are entities that obtain local regulatory approvals and establish local marketing channels to provide orbcomm services in their designated countries 
as a us company  we are not legally qualified to hold a license to operate as a telecommunications provider in some countries and our country representative program permits us to serve many international markets 
in some cases  a country representative enters into a joint venture with us 
in other cases  the country representative is an independent entity that pays us fees based on the amount of airtime usage on our system 
country representatives may distribute our services directly or through a distribution network made up of local vars 
subject to certain limitations  our service license agreements grant to the international licensee  among other things  the exclusive right subject to our right to appoint ivars to market services using our satellite system in a designated region and a limited right to use certain of our proprietary technologies and intellectual property 
international licensees and country representatives who are appointed by us pay fees for access to the system in their region based on the number of subscriber communicators activated on the network in their territory and the amount of data transmitted through the system 
we may adjust pricing in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements 
we pay international licensees and country representatives a commission based on the revenue we receive from ivars that is generated from subscriber communicators that ivars activate in their territories 
we have entered into or are negotiating new service license or country representative agreements with several international licensees and country representatives  respectively  including former licensees of the predecessor company and new groups consisting of affiliates of former licensees of the predecessor company 
until new service license agreements are in place  we will operate in those regions where a licensee has not been contracted either pursuant to letters of intent entered into with such licensee or pursuant to the terms of the original agreements with the predecessor company  as is currently the case in morocco 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in negotiating new service license or country representative agreements 
competition currently  we are the only commercial provider of below ghz band  or little leo  two way data satellite services optimized for narrowband 
however  we are not the only provider of data communication services  and we face competition from a variety of existing and proposed products and services 
competing service providers can be divided into three main categories terrestrial tower based  low earth orbit mobile satellite and geostationary satellite service providers 

table of contents terrestrial tower based networks while terrestrial tower based networks are capable of providing services at costs comparable to ours  they lack seamless global coverage 
terrestrial coverage is dependent on the location of tower transmitters  which are generally located in densely populated areas or heavily traveled routes 
several data and messaging markets  such as long haul trucking  railroads  oil and gas  agriculture  utility distribution  and heavy construction  have significant activity in sparsely populated areas with limited or no terrestrial coverage 
in addition  there are many different terrestrial systems and protocols  so service providers must coordinate with multiple carriers to enable service in different coverage areas 
in some geographic areas  terrestrial tower based networks have gaps in their coverage and may require a back up system to fill in such coverage gaps 
we have entered into re seller agreements with several major cellular wireless providers in the us and the rest of the world to provide terrestrial communications services to our customers who want these services  in either single mode or dual mode configurations  using the wireless communications networks of these cellular wireless providers 
low earth orbit mobile satellite service providers low earth orbit mobile satellite service providers operating above the ghz band  or big leo systems  can provide data connectivity with global coverage that can compete with our communications services 
to date  the primary focus of big leo satellite service providers has been primarily on circuit switched communications tailored for voice traffic  which  by its nature  is less efficient for the transfer of short data messages because they require a dedicated circuit that is time and bandwidth intensive when compared to the amount of information transmitted 
however  big leo satellite service providers have shifted their focus more on mm data communications 
these systems entail significantly higher costs for the satellite fleet operator and the end users 
our principal big leo mobile satellite service competitors are globalstar  inc and iridium communications inc 
geostationary satellite service providers geostationary satellite system operators can offer services that compete with ours 
certain pan regional or global systems operating in the l or s bands  such as inmarsat plc  are designed and licensed for mobile high speed data and voice services 
however  the equipment cost and service fees for narrowband  or small packet  data communications with these systems is significantly more expensive than for our system 
some companies  such as the omnitracs subsidiary of qualcomm incorporated  which uses ses s satellites operating in c and ku bands  have developed technologies to use their bandwidth for mobile applications 
we believe that the equipment cost and service fees for narrowband data communications using these systems are also significantly higher than ours  and that these geostationary providers cannot offer global service with competitive communications devices and costs 
in addition  these geostationary systems have other limitations  such as requiring a clear line of sight between the communicator equipment and the satellite  are affected by adverse weather or atmospheric conditions  and are vulnerable to catastrophic single point failures of their satellites with limited backup options 
we have an agreement to resell satellite airtime service provided by a geostationary satellite operator 
research and development we are able to minimize our research and development costs by leveraging the investments made by our vars and ivars 
see sales  marketing and distribution 
we have incurred no research and development costs in and backlog we have pre bill backlog  which represents subscriber communicators activated at the customer s request for testing prior to putting the units into actual service  was  units as of december   as compared 
table of contents with a pre bill backlog of  as of december  we believe that the majority of units that comprise our pre bill backlog will be billable within a one year period 
we are not able to determine pre bill backlog in dollars because the service costs for each subscriber communicator varies by customer 
orbcomm communications system overview our data communications services are provided by our proprietary two way satellite system  which is designed to provide near real time and store and forward communication to and from both fixed and mobile assets around the world 
we also provide terrestrial cellular wireless data communications services through reseller agreements with cellular wireless providers 
in addition  we provide ais data services and high performance  vertically integrated wireless information technology applications and solutions for the global transportation and maritime markets 
our system has four operational components the space component  which consists of a constellation of operational satellites for mm data  in multiple orbital planes between and miles above the earth four primary planes of five to eight satellites each operating in the vhf band and leased capacity on two ais microsatellites operating in two orbital planes one polar plane and one equatorial plane  the ground and control component  which consists of fifteen gateway earth stations  two ais data reception earth stations  with a third ais data reception earth station under construction  three regional gateway control centers  a network control center in dulles  virginia including a redundant backup control center in the state of washington  through which data sent to and from satellite subscriber communicators are routed  including a communications node for terrestrial services through which data sent to and from terrestrial units are routed  the subscriber component  which consists of satellite subscriber communicators and cellular terrestrial units  or wireless modems incorporating sims used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and our system  and the end user component  which consists of ais data services and wireless gps tracking  monitoring  two way command and control  analytics for fleets of refrigerated trailers  trucks and railcars 
specialized data feeds are established through our application gateway interface to third party dispatch systems and proprietary customer software applications to provide customers data and analytics from telematics products and specialized sensors 
for most applications using our system  data is generated by end user developed software and is currently transferred to either a subscriber communicator  or a gprs based wireless device using a sim on the cellular provider s wireless network 
in the case of the satellite subscriber communicator selection  data is encapsulated and transmitted to the next satellite that comes into view 
the data is then routed by the satellite to the next gateway earth station it successfully connects to  which in turn forwards it to the associated gateway control center 
within the gateway control center  the data is processed and forwarded to its ultimate destination after acknowledgement to the satellite subscriber communicator that the entire data message content has been received 
in the case of the cellular device  a message is routed through the cellular provider s wireless network gateway gprs support node ggsn  to the associated orbcomm access point name apn located within the gateway control center  and forwarded to its ultimate destination in real time 
the destination may be another subscriber communicator  a corporate resource management system  any personal or business internet e mail address  a pager or a text message capable cellular phone 
in addition  data can be sent in the reverse direction a feature which is utilized by many applications to remotely control assets 
when a satellite is in view of and connected to a gateway earth station at the time it receives data from a subscriber communicator  a transmission is initiated to transfer the data in what we refer to as near real time mode 
in this near real time mode  the data is passed immediately from a subscriber communicator via a 
table of contents satellite to a gateway earth station that transmits the message to the appropriate control center for routing to its final destination 
when a satellite is not immediately in view of a gateway earth station  the satellite switches to a store and forward mode to accept data in globalgram format 
globalgrams are short messages consisting of data of up to approximately bytes and are stored in a satellite until it can connect through a gateway earth station to the appropriate control center 
the automatic mode switching capability between near real time service and globalgram service allows the satellite network to be available to satellite subscriber communicators worldwide regardless of their location 
end user data can be delivered by the gateway control center in a variety of formats 
communications options include private and public communications links to the control center  such as standard internet  dedicated telecommunications company circuits  and vpn based transports 
data can also be received via standard e mail protocols with full delivery acknowledgement as requested  or via our internet protocol gateway interface in html and xml formats 
wherever possible  our system makes use of existing  mature technologies and conforms to internationally accepted standards for electronic mail and web technologies 
for wireless based applications  the orbcomm and cellular providers  apn provides the flexibility for developers to control the end to end connectivity as needed for the application  using customizable tcp  udp  and sms services 
this allows existing legacy applications to be retrofit and completely new system designs to be implemented to integrate existing as well as new end user business applications 
end user solutions include products and services that provide gps tracking  monitoring  and full two way control for the transportation industry including refrigeration units  rail cars  generators  trailers and containers 
we are formally approved by both carrier transicold and thermo king as a licensed provider of two way communications solutions that are fully integrated with their refrigerated unit microprocessors 
the startrak network also provides for data integration with customer shipping system  leading to state of the art integration of shipment planning  real time gps location and asset condition status 
the network delivers immediate alarm notifications via cell phone sms messaging and or e mail to local responsible parties identified on the dispatch order 
ultimately  the networks powerful centralized management and distributed notification capabilities provide customers assurance that their shipment arrives at destination  at specified quality levels 
system status next generation satellite launch on may   we entered into a procurement agreement with sierra nevada corporation snc to construct our eighteen low earth orbit next generation satellites 
snc will also provide launch support services  a test satellite excluding the mechanical structure  a satellite software simulator and the associated ground support equipment 
the total contract price is million  subject to reduction upon failure to achieve certain in orbit operational milestones with respect to the initial satellites or if the pre ship reviews of each shipset are delayed more than days after the specified time periods described below 
we have agreed to pay snc up to million in incentive payments for the successful operation of the initial eighteen satellites five years following the successful completion of in orbit testing for the third shipset of eight satellites 
on august   we entered into two task order agreements with snc in connection with the procurement agreement dated may  under the terms of the launch vehicle changes task order agreement  snc will perform the activities to launch eighteen of our next generation satellites on a spacex falcon e or falcon launch vehicle 
the total price for the launch activities is cost reimbursable up to million less a credit of million  which services are cancellable by us with the unused credit applied to other activities under our agreement with snc 
under the terms of the engineering change requests and enhancements task order agreement  snc will design and make changes to each of the next generation satellites in order to accommodate an additional payload to bus interface 
the total price for the engineering changes requests is cost reimbursable up to million 
both task order agreements are payable monthly as the services are performed  provided that with respect to the launch vehicle changes task order agreement  the credit in the amount of million will first be deducted against amounts accrued thereunder until the entire balance is expended 

table of contents on august   we entered into an amendment to the procurement agreement which amends certain terms of the procurement agreement dated may  and supplements or amends five separate task order agreements 
the amendment modifies the milestone payment schedule under the procurement agreement but does not change the total contract price excluding optional satellites and costs under the task order agreements of million and indefinitely extends the deadline to exercise options at a cost plus fixed fee basis to order additional next generation satellites if the market demands such an increase or if lower latencies are required or to mitigate a launch failure 
payments under the amendment extend into the second quarter of  subject to snc s successful completion of each payment milestone 
on august   we entered into commercial launch services agreement the lsa with space exploration technologies corp 
spacex pursuant to which spacex will provide launch services the launch services using multiple spacex falcon e launch vehicles for the carriage into low earth orbit our next generation satellites currently being constructed by snc 
under the lsa  spacex will also provide us satellite to launch vehicle integration and support services  as well as certain related optional services 
we anticipate that the launch services will be performed between and subject to certain rights of ours and spacex to reschedule any of the particular launch services as needed 
we are in discussions with spacex to provide the launch services on multiple falcon launch vehicles in lieu of multiple falcon e launch vehicles 
based on these changed circumstances  we have revised our next generation satellite deployment plan 
we currently intend to use a falcon launch vehicle to carry one next generation satellite into orbit later this year 
we expect this launch will be followed by at least two additional launches for the seventeen other next generation satellites that snc is currently producing 
the total price payable under the lsa excluding any options or additional launch services is million  subject to certain adjustments 
we may postpone and reschedule the launch services for any reason at our sole discretion  following a delay of months for any particular launch services 
we also have the right to terminate any of the launch services subject to the payment of a termination fee in an amount that would be based on the date we exercise our termination right 
through a series of launches  we intend to replenish the existing constellation of satellites with next generation satellites with increased communications capabilities and our ais payload  which  depending on the capabilities of the replacement satellites  may require fewer satellites than we currently have 
ais satellite deployment and license agreement on september   we entered into an ais satellite deployment and license agreement the ais satellite agreement with ohb system ag ohb pursuant to which ohb  through its affiliate luxspace sarl lxs  would design  construct  launch and in orbit test two ais microsatellites and design and construct the required ground support equipment 
under the ais satellite agreement  we obtained exclusive licenses for all data with certain exceptions as defined in the ais satellite agreement collected or transmitted by the two ais microsatellites including all ais data during the term of the ais satellite agreement and nonexclusive licenses for all ais data collected or transmitted by another microsatellite expected to be launched by lxs 
the ais satellite agreement provided for milestone payments totaling million inclusive of in orbit testing subject to certain adjustments 
payments under the ais satellite agreement began upon the execution of the agreement and continued upon successful completion of each milestone through to the launch of the two ais microsatellites in addition  to the extent that both ais microsatellites continue to successfully operate after launch  we will pay ohb lease payments of up to million  subject to certain adjustments  over thirty six months 
in addition  ohb was entitled to credits of up to million to be used solely for the microsatellites ais data license fees payable to us under a separate ais data resale agreement 
we and ohb entered into a 
table of contents memorandum of agreement on january  to amend the ais satellite agreement to i increase the milestone payments to million in the aggregate  ii eliminate the million in credit described above and iii increase the lease payments described above to up to million over thirty six months 
on october   the first of two ais microsatellites was launched and was placed in service in december and is providing full commercial service 
on january   second ais microsatellite was launched and placed into full commercial service in february first generation satellite health our satellite fleet was generally put into service in the late s and has an estimated operating life of approximately nine to twelve years after giving effect to certain operational changes and software updates 
we believe that our satellite performance remains stable and sufficient for the use of our customers 
our satellite availability  or the percentage of time that an operational satellite is available to pass commercial traffic  was in twenty of the operational satellites have aggregate average availability over 
with the high probability of several satellites in view at any one time  especially in the primary coverage area  and the constant motion of the satellites  the time an operational satellite is unavailable is relatively insignificant 
we consider a satellite operational unless it can no longer provide any communications service  and we determine that further recovery efforts are not expected to return it to service 
due to our satellite constellation architecture  which consists of numerous independent satellites  our space component is inherently redundant and service quality is not significantly affected by an individual satellite failure  although service quality could be significantly affected by multiple satellite failures 
our system has experienced minor degradation over time  primarily due to battery capacity reduction 
we have and expect to continue to develop operational procedures to minimize the impact for providing messaging services with degraded batteries 
gateway health the gateway earth stations in the united states and internationally are performing well 
we continue to perform hardware and software upgrades which have improved the availability of the gateway earth stations 
in  we completed design and testing of a new gateway modem that will improve messaging throughput 
one new modem has been installed in one us ges location and additional modems will be installed in the remaining gateway earth stations in conjunction with the aforementioned upgrades 
in general  our international gateway control centers are stable 
our gateway control centers all regularly exceeded availability on a month to month basis 
network capacity we continue to conduct analyses to investigate the utilization of our communication channels 
various metrics were used in evaluating the different elements of the communication protocol 
the efficiency of the satellites random access subscriber receivers is measured as a ratio of successfully received inbound communication packets to the number of assignments made to subscriber communicators 
from through  a number of improvements were made to raise and maintain this performance ratio and substantial increase throughput capability 
also significant increases to the subscriber reservation capacity were made increasing reservation receiver capacity 
it should be noted that failed messaging transactions do not result in lost messages  but do require subscriber communicators to re initiate message transmissions  which could translate into message delays 

table of contents regulation of our system in the united states fcc authorization any entity seeking to construct  launch  or operate a commercial satellite system in the united states must first be licensed by the us federal communications commission fcc 
orbcomm license corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  holds the satellite constellation license originally issued to orbcomm global lp in which we refer to as the space license 
orbcomm license corp 
also holds additional fcc licenses to operate four united states gateway earth stations  and deploy and operate up to  satellite subscriber communicators in the united states 
the current space license authorizes the continuing operation of the first generation orbcomm satellites  the construction  launch and operation a total of orbcomm next generation satellites  and any required construction  launch and operation during the term of the license of additional technically identical replacement satellites 
based on changed circumstances relating among other things to launch vehicle availability  we have an application pending before the fcc to modify our space license to accommodate revisions to our next generation satellite deployment plan for the eighteen next generation satellites that snc is currently producing 
we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
we also believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  but we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license modifications  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact grant our currently pending application to modify the space license to accommodate our revised next generation satellite deployment plan 
additionally  there can be no assurance that  to the extent that any other modification of our fcc licenses may be required in the future to address changed circumstances  that any related fcc applications we may file will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fcc revokes or fails to renew our fcc licenses  or does not grant any future application we file to modify one or more of our licenses  or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our fcc licenses  any such circumstance could have a material adverse impact on our business 
finally  our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory environment 
license renewal our space license renewal application was granted by the fcc on march   extending the term of the space license until april the current fcc licenses for the united states gateway earth stations and subscriber communicators expire on may  and june   respectively  and the renewal applications must be filed between and days prior to expiration 
although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license renewals  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact renew our fcc licenses in the future 
fcc license conditions we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
we also believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  although we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
under the fcc s current rules and policies relating to little leo licensing  access in the united states to certain portions of the uplink and downlink spectrum assigned to our system was made subject to possible future spectrum sharing arrangements with one or more other little leo systems  if such systems are proposed  and then authorized by the fcc 
however  there are currently no other fcc little leo licensees authorized in our spectrum 
while other entities could seek to be licensed in the little leo service by the fcc  to our knowledge 
table of contents no new applications have been submitted to date 
if any one or more new entities are licensed and do in fact proceed with system deployment in accordance with the previously established fcc requirements  we believe that there would be no material adverse effect on our system operations  although we cannot assure you it will be the case 
non common carrier status all of our system s fcc licenses authorize service provision on a non common carrier basis 
as a result  the system and the services provided thereby have been subject to limited fcc regulations  but not the obligations  restrictions and reporting requirements applicable to common carriers or to providers of commercial mobile radio services  or cmrs 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future  we will not be deemed by the fcc to provide services that are designated common carrier or cmrs  or that the fcc will not exercise its discretionary authority to apply its common carrier or cmrs rules and regulations to us or our system 
if this were to occur  we would be subject to fcc obligations that include record retention requirements  limitations on use or disclosure of customer proprietary network information and truth in billing regulations 
in addition  we would need to obtain fcc approval for foreign ownership in excess of percent and authority under section of the communications act of  as amended  to provide international services 
finally  we would be subject to additional reporting obligations with regard to international traffic and circuits  and equal employment opportunity compliance 
united states import and export control regulations we are subject to us import and export control laws and regulations  specifically the arms export control act  the international traffic in arms regulations  the export administration regulations and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the us department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control  and we believe we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations 
we also believe that we have obtained all the specific authorizations currently needed to operate our business and believe that the terms of the relevant licenses are sufficient given the scope and duration of the activities to which they pertain 
regulation of our system in other countries communications services we  the relevant international licensee and or the relevant international licensee s country representative in each country outside the united states must obtain the requisite local regulatory authorization before the commencement of service in that country 
the process for obtaining the applicable regulatory authorization varies from country to country  and in some instances may require technical studies or actual experimental field tests under the direction and or supervision of the local regulatory authority 
failure to obtain or maintain any requisite authorizations in any given country or territory could mean that services may not be provided in that country or territory 
certain countries continue to require that some or all telecommunications services be provided by a government owned or controlled entity 
therefore  under such circumstances  we may be required to offer our services through a government owned or controlled entity 
as part of our international initiative  we are in the process of seeking or assessing the prospect of obtaining regulatory authority in other countries and territories  including china  india and russia 
because our satellites are licensed by the fcc  the scope of the local regulatory authority in any given country or territory outside of the united states with the exception of countries where gateway earth stations are located is generally limited to the operation of subscriber communicator equipment  but may also involve additional restrictions or conditions 
based on available information  we believe that the regulatory authorizations obtained by us  our international licensees and or their country representatives are sufficient for the provision of commercial services 
table of contents in the subject countries and territories  subject to continuing regulatory compliance 
we also believe that additional local service provision authorizations may be obtained in other countries and territories in the near future 
non us gateway earth stations to date  in addition to those in the united states  gateway earth stations have been authorized and deployed in argentina  australia  brazil  cura ao  italy  japan  kazakhstan  malaysia  morocco  south africa  and south korea 
gateway earth stations are generally licensed on an individual facility basis 
this process normally entails radio frequency coordination within the country of operation for the specific frequencies to be used in the designated geographic location of the subject gateway earth station 
this domestic frequency coordination is in addition to any international coordination that may be required  as determined by the proximity of the gateway earth station location to foreign borders see international regulation of our system 
based on the best available information  we believe that each of the above listed gateway earth stations authorizations is sufficient for the provision of our commercial services in the areas served by the relevant facilities 
we will need additional gateway earth station authorizations in other countries as we install additional gateway earth stations around the world 
equipment standards each manufacturer of the applicable subscriber communicator is contractually responsible to obtain and maintain the governmental authorizations necessary to operate their subscriber communicators in each jurisdiction 
most countries generally require all radio transmission equipment used within their borders to comply with operating standards that may include specifications relating to required minimum acceptable levels for radiated power  power density and spurious emissions into adjacent frequency bands not allocated for the intended use 
technical criteria established by telecommunications equipment standards issued by the fcc and or the european telecommunications standards institute  or etsi  are generally accepted and or closely duplicated by domestic equipment approval regulations in most countries 
to the best of our knowledge  all current models of subscriber communicators comply with established fcc and etsi standards 
international regulation of our system our use of certain orbital planes and related system radio frequency assignments  as licensed by the fcc  is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the international telecommunication union  or itu 
in order to protect satellite systems from harmful radio frequency interference from other satellite communications systems  the itu maintains a master international frequency register  or mifr  of radio frequency assignments and their associated orbital locations 
each itu member state referred to as an administration is required by treaty to give notice of  coordinate and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations with the itu s radio communication bureau 
the fcc serves as the notifying administration for the united states and is responsible for filing and coordinating our allocated radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations for the system with both the itu s radio communication bureau and the national administrations of other countries in each satellite s service region 
while the fcc  as our notifying administration  is responsible for coordinating the system  in practice the satellite licensee is generally responsible for identifying any potential interference concerns with existing systems or those enjoying date priority and to coordinate with such systems 
if we are unable to reach agreement and finalize coordination  the fcc would then assist with such coordination 
when the coordination process is completed  the itu formally enters each satellite system s orbital and frequency use characteristics in the mifr 
such registration notifies all proposed users of frequencies that the registered satellite system is protected from interference from subsequent or non conforming uses by other nations 
in the event disputes arise during coordination  the itu s radio regulations do not contain mandatory 
table of contents dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution procedures are based on the willingness of the parties concerned to reach a mutually acceptable agreement voluntarily 
neither the itu specifically  nor international law generally  provides clear remedies if this voluntary process fails 
the fcc has notified the itu that our system was initially placed in service in april and that it has operated without any substantiated complaints of interference since that time 
the fcc has also informed the itu that our system has successfully completed its coordination with all countries other than russia 
we expect that we will successfully complete the itu coordination process with russia in the future  at which time the complete system will be formally registered in the mifr 
on september   the fcc transmitted an advance publication submission to the itu relating to the coast guard demonstration satellite  the quick launch satellites and the next generation satellites  the first step in the international coordination process for our new satellites 
if design modifications to future system satellites entail substantial changes to the frequency utilization by the subject system component s  additional international coordination may be required or reasonably deemed advisable 
however  we believe that itu coordination can be successfully completed in all circumstances where such coordination is required  although we cannot assure you that we will successfully complete such itu coordination 
failure to complete requisite itu coordination could have a material adverse effect on our business 
regardless  to date  and to our best knowledge  the system has not caused harmful interference to any other radio system  or suffered harmful interference from any other radio system 
intellectual property we use and hold intellectual property rights for a number of trademarks  service marks and logos for our system 
we have one main mark orbcomm which is registered or is pending registration in approximately countries

item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
any of these risks could also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or the price of our common stock 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risks relating to our business ongoing global economic instability and uncertainty could adversely affect us 
the current climate of global economic instability and uncertainty negatively impacts customer confidence  increases market volatility and continues to impair general business activity 
if these conditions continue or worsen  risks to us include potential declines in revenues  profitability and cash flow due to reduced orders for our products and services  payment delays or other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers  end users and prospective customers and end users  potential adverse impacts on our ability and our customers and vendors ability to access credit and capital sources  and potential reprioritization by our customers  end users and prospective customers and end users of resources away from investments in capital improvements  equipment  vehicles or vessels which use our products and services including in the transportation market among other markets which use our products and services 
any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flow 
our business plan depends on both increased demand for wireless mm and ais data communications products and services and our ability to successfully implement it 
our business plan is predicated on growth in demand for mm and ais data services 
demand for such data products and services may not grow  or may even contract  either generally or in particular geographic markets  for particular types of services or during particular time periods 
a lack of demand could impair our ability to sell products and services  develop and successfully market new products and services and could exert downward pressure on prices 
any decline in prices would decrease our revenues and profitability and negatively affect our ability to generate cash for investments and other working capital needs 

table of contents our ability to successfully implement our business plan will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain and limit the effects of degradation of the health  capacity and control of our existing satellite network  the ability of our vendors to successfully complete the design  build and launch of our next generation satellites and related ground infrastructure  products and services and  once launched  our ability to maintain the health  capacity and control of such satellite constellation  the level of market acceptance and demand for our products and services  including our recently re established ais service  our ability to introduce innovative new products and services that satisfy market demand  including new service offerings on our next generation satellites and dual mode products and services  our ability to sell our products and services in additional countries  the ability of our oems  vars and ivars to market and distribute their products  services and applications effectively and their continued development of innovative and improved solutions and applications for our products and services  the effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering similar services and products  and our ability to maintain competitive prices for our products and services and control costs 
we have incurred substantial operating losses and are incurring net losses 
we anticipate additional future losses 
we must increase our revenues to become profitable 
we have had annual net losses since our inception  including a net loss of less than million for fiscal year and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our future results will continue to reflect significant operating expenses  including expenses associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts  maintaining the infrastructure to operate as a public company and the maintenance of existing gateway earth stations and satellite network ground facilities 
as a result  we may incur additional operating losses and net losses in the future 
the continued development of our business also will require additional capital expenditures for  among other things  the development  construction  launch and insurance for our next generation satellites  and costs relating to the installation of additional gateway earth stations and associated satellite network ground facilities around the world  as well as the maintenance of existing gateway earth stations and satellite network ground facilities that we own and operate 
accordingly  as we make these capital investments  our future results will include greater depreciation and amortization expense which reflect the full cost of acquiring these new assets 
in order to achieve and maintain profitability  we must continue to increase revenue 
revenue will depend on the success of our resellers and acceptance of our products and services by end users in current markets  as well as in new geographic and industry markets 
we may not be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
we may need additional capital to complete our capital expenditure plans or to pursue additional growth opportunities  which may not be available to us when we need it on favorable terms  or at all 
our next generation satellites or launch vehicles may not be completed on time  and the costs associated with the satellites or launch vehicles may be greater than expected 
if our future cash flows from operations are insufficient or if our capital expenditures exceed our spending plans  either in terms of aggregate amount or timing  our existing sources of liquidity  including cash and cash equivalents on hand  availability under our line of credit facility with sierra nevada corporation snc in the amount of up to million the facility and cash generated from sales of our products and services may not be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations  capital expenditures including the deployment of additional 
table of contents satellites  working capital and other financing requirements 
if we continue to incur operating losses in the future  we may need to reduce further our operating costs or obtain alternate sources of financing  or both  to remain viable and  in particular  to fund the design  construction  launch and insurance for our next generation satellites 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to additional sources of capital on favorable terms or at all 
we estimate that the aggregate costs associated with the design  building launch and insurance of our next generation satellites and related infrastructure upgrades could be approximately million  of which approximately million has been paid 
we may not complete our next generation satellites and related infrastructure  products and services on time  on budget or at all 
the design  manufacture and launch of satellite systems are highly complex and historically have been subject to delays and cost overruns 
the deployment of our next generation satellites may suffer from delays  interruptions or increased costs due to many factors  some of which may be beyond our control  including lower than anticipated internally generated cash flows  the failure to maintain our ability to make draws under the facility  engineering or manufacturing performance falling below expected levels of output or efficiency  denial or delays in receipt of regulatory approvals or non compliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities  the breakdown or failure of equipment or systems  non performance by third party contractors  including the prime system contractor  the launch services provider and associated subcontractors  the inability to license necessary technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all  use of a new or unproven launch vehicle or the failure of the launch services provider to sustain its business  launch delays or failures or in orbit satellite failures once launched or the decision to manufacture additional replacement satellites for future launches  labor disputes or disruptions in labor productivity or the unavailability of skilled labor  changes in project scope  additional requirements imposed by changes in laws  and severe weather or catastrophic events such as fires  earthquakes  storms or explosions 
if any of the above events occur  they could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to deploy our next generation satellites and related infrastructure  products and services 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our internally generated cash flows will meet our current expectations or that we will not encounter increased costs 
among other factors leading to the uncertainty over our internally generated cash flows is the future demand for our ais service or the products and services of our newly acquired businesses may be priced lower than our expectations 
if available funds from the facility and internally generated cash flows are less than we expect  our ability to maintain our network  design  build and launch our next generation satellites and related ground infrastructure  develop new products and services  and pursue additional growth opportunities may be impaired  which could significantly limit the development of our business and impair our ability to provide a commercially acceptable level of service 

table of contents if we fail to satisfy the ongoing borrowing conditions of the facility  we may need additional capital to complete our capital expenditure plans 
we may need to use borrowings under the facility to partially fund the construction of our next generation satellites 
our ability to continue to draw funds under the facility over time will be dependent on the satisfaction of borrowing conditions  including compliance with the covenants under the facility  accuracy of the representations we make under the facility  and compliance with the other terms of the facility  including the absence of events of default 
some of these borrowing conditions are outside of our control 
if we do not continue to satisfy the borrowing conditions under the facility  we may need to find other sources of financing and there can be no assurance that we would have access to other sources of financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we default under the facility while amounts borrowed  if any  remain outstanding  snc may require immediate repayment in full of amounts borrowed or foreclose on our assets 
the facility contains events of default  including non compliance with the covenants under the facility  cross default with other indebtedness of at least  insolvency  breach or default of loan documents  breach or default of our procurement agreement with snc  and a determination by snc that we have experienced a material adverse change in our business 
some of these events of default are outside of our control 
if we experience an event of default  snc may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the facility 
if we fail to repay such amounts  snc may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the facility  which includes the first nine next generation satellites and our accounts receivables 
we incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management devotes substantial time to compliance requirements 
we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses as a public company  including costs resulting from regulations regarding corporate governance practices 
for example  the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors  audit committees  distribution of annual and interim reports  stockholder meetings  stockholder approvals  solicitation of proxies  conflicts of interest  stockholder voting rights and codes of conduct 
our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements 
moreover  these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly 
further  these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 

table of contents if end users do not accept our services and the applications developed by vars and us  or we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or licenses for particular countries or territories  we will fail to attract new customers and our business will be harmed 
our success depends on end users accepting our services  the applications developed by vars and us  and a number of other factors  including the technical capabilities of our system  the availability of low cost subscriber communicators  the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and other approvals in the united states and other countries and territories in which we operate  the price of our services and the extent and availability of competitive or alternative services 
we may not succeed in increasing revenue from the sale of our products and services to new and existing customers 
our failure to significantly increase the number of end users will harm our business 
our business plan assumes that potential customers and end users will accept certain limitations inherent in our satellite communications system 
for example  our satellite system is optimized for small packet  or narrowband  data transmissions  is subject to certain delays in the relay of messages  referred to as latencies  and may be subject to certain line of sight limitations between our satellites and the end user s subscriber communicator 
in addition  our satellite system is not capable of handling voice traffic 
certain potential end users  particularly those requiring full time  real time communications and those requiring the transmission of large amounts of data or voice traffic  may find such limitations unacceptable 
furthermore  current satellite based ais signal reception systems may not receive all ais transmission signals on ais equipped vessels in a given day due to signal collisions and co channel interference of ais transmissions  particularly in areas with a high density of ais equipped vessels such as ports 
in addition to the limitations imposed by the architecture of our satellite communications system  our failure to obtain the necessary regulatory and other approvals or licenses in a given country or territory will preclude the availability of our services in such country or territory until such time  if at all  that such approvals or licenses can be obtained 
certain potential end users requiring messaging services in those countries and territories may find such limitations unacceptable 
we face competition from existing and potential competitors in the telecommunications industry  including numerous terrestrial and satellite based network systems with greater resources  which could reduce our market share and revenues 
competition in the telecommunications industry is intense  fueled by rapid  continuous technological advances and alliances between industry participants seeking to capture significant market share 
we face competition from numerous existing and potential alternative telecommunications products and services provided by various large and small companies  including sophisticated two way satellite based data and voice communication services and next generation digital cellular services  such as gsm  g  g and lte  which has influenced the price at which our vars and other service providers offer our communications services 
the provision of satellite and terrestrial based data services and products are subject to downward price pressure to expand their respective market share 
recently  competition from iridium  inmarsat and  to a lesser extent  globalstar and thuraya  four competing global satellite communication services operators  has been increasing with respect to satellite low speed data service 
in addition  a continuing trend toward consolidation and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry could give rise to significant new competitors  and foreign competitors may benefit from government subsidies  or other protective measures  afforded by their home countries 
some of these competitors may provide more efficient or less expensive services than we are able to provide  which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our revenues and business 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
additionally  many of these companies have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers 
furthermore  these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer customers more attractive terms than we can 

table of contents we have a limited operating history with respect to developing and growing our business organically and through acquisitions 
in we re commenced the commercialization of our satellite based ais service  which had been interrupted  and purchased new technologies and assets providing end user solutions 
these factors make it difficult to evaluate your investment in us 
in late  we re commenced the commercialization of our satellite based ais service 
in mid and early  we expanded our business with technologies purchased from alanco technologies and par technology  respectively 
our prospects and ability to implement our current business plan  including our ability to generate revenues and positive operating cash flows  will depend on our ability to  among other things successfully design  construct  launch  place in commercial service  operate and maintain our ais payload equipped next generation satellites in a timely and cost efficient manner  develop licensing and distribution arrangements in key markets within and outside the united states sufficient to capture and retain an adequate customer base  install the necessary ground infrastructure and obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory and other approvals in key markets outside the united states  by our own efforts or through our existing or future international licensees  to expand our business internationally  successfully integrate our recent acquisitions of technology  transfer their capabilities across new and existing vertical markets and drive new subscribers to the company s global communications network while accelerating the growth of their suite of products by adding scale in manufacturing and service delivery  and successfully attract and maintain manufacturers that provide for the timely design  manufacture and distribution of subscriber communicators in sufficient quantities  with appropriate functional characteristics and at competitive prices  for various applications 
given our limited operating history  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives or develop a sufficiently large revenue generating customer base to achieve and maintain profitability 
our success in generating sufficient cash from operations to fund a portion of the cost of constructing  launching and insuring our next generation satellites will depend in part on the market acceptance of our ais service  which may not occur 
the market for our satellite based ais service is new and untested 
we cannot predict with certainty the potential demand for the services we plan to offer or the extent to which we will be able to meet that demand 
although we believe the market for satellite based ais service is significant  the actual size of the market is unknown and subject to significant uncertainty 
demand for our ais data service offerings in general  in particular geographic markets  for particular types of services or during particular time periods and our inability to provide ais service may not enable us to generate sufficient positive cash flow to fund a portion of the cost of our next generation satellites 
among other things  end user acceptance of our ais data service offerings will depend upon the actual size of the addressable market  our ability to provide attractive service offerings at competitive prices to our target markets  the effectiveness of our competitors in developing and offering alternative technologies or lower priced services  and general and local economic conditions 
our business plan assumes a rapidly growing revenue base for ais data service 
if we cannot implement this business plan successfully and gain sufficient market acceptance for ais data services  our business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we rely on third parties  and our subsidiaries  to market and distribute our services to end users 
if these parties are unwilling or unable to provide applications and services to end users  our business will be harmed 
we rely on vars to market and distribute our services to end users in the united states  and we rely on international licensees  country representatives  vars and ivars  outside the united states we refer collectively here to all such parties including our subsidiaries as resellers 
we also rely on resellers to market and distribute our ais services 
the willingness of our existing resellers  as well as potential new resellers  to engage or continue to engage in our business depends on a number of factors  including whether they perceive our services to be compatible with their business objectives  whether they believe we will successfully deploy our next generation satellites  whether the prices they can charge end users will provide an adequate return  and regulatory constraints  if any 
we believe that successful marketing of our services will depend on the design  development and commercial availability of applications that support the specific needs of the targeted end users 
the design  development and implementation of applications require the commitment of substantial financial and technological resources on the part of these resellers 
certain resellers are  and many potential resellers will be  newly formed or small ventures with limited financial resources  and such entities might not be successful in their efforts to design applications or effectively market our services 
the inability of these resellers to provide applications to end users could have a harmful effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our success depends upon the pricing of applications by our resellers to end users  over which we have no control other than with respect to ais services under certain circumstances 
as a result of these arrangements  we are dependent on the performance of our resellers to generate substantially all our service revenues 
if our resellers fail to market or distribute our services effectively  our revenues  profitability  liquidity and reputation could be adversely affected 
defects or errors in applications could result in end users not being able to use our services  which would damage our reputation and harm our financial condition 
our resellers must develop applications quickly to keep pace with rapidly changing markets 
these applications  as well as new models of subscriber communicators  have long development cycles and are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when subsequent versions are introduced  which could result in the disruption of our services to the end users 
such disruption could damage our reputation as well as the reputation of the respective resellers  and result in lost customers  lost revenue  diverted development resources  and increased service and warranty costs 
because we depend on a few significant customers for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss or decline or slowdown in growth in business in any of these customers could seriously harm our business 
significant customers such as the ai subsidiary of id systems  inc formerly a division of ge  caterpillar  komatsu and hitachi  collectively  represented and of our revenues in and  respectively  and are expected to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the near future 
as a result  the loss of any one of these customers  or decline or slowdown in the growth in business of these customers  which could occur at any time  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  because service revenue depends either partially or entirely on the usage of the orbcomm system by our customers and end users  the decline or slowdown in the growth of usage patterns of these customers which could occur at any time and with or without a reduction in the number of billable subscriber communicators activated on the orbcomm system by such customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if our international licensees and country representatives are not successful in establishing their businesses outside of the united states  the prospects for our business will be limited 
outside of the united states  we rely in part on international licensees and country representatives to establish businesses in their respective territories  including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals as well as managing local vars 
international licensees and country representatives may not be successful in obtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory and other approvals to provide our services in their assigned territories and  even if those approvals are obtained and maintained  international licensees and or country representatives may not be successful in developing a market and or distribution network within their territories 
certain of the international licensees and or country representatives are  or are likely to be  newly formed or small ventures with limited or no operational history and limited financial resources  and any such entities may not be successful in their efforts to secure adequate financing and to continue operating 
in addition  in certain countries and territories outside the united states  we rely on international licensees and country representatives to operate and maintain various components of our system  such as gateway earth stations 
these international licensees and country representatives may not be successful in operating and maintaining such components of our communications system and may not have the same financial incentives as we do to maintain those components in good repair 
some of our international licensees and country representatives are experiencing significant operational and financial difficulties and have in the past defaulted on their obligations to us 
some of our international licensees and country representatives were also international licensees and country representatives of our predecessor company and  as a consequence of the bankruptcy of orbcomm global lp  they were left in many cases with significant financial problems  including significant debt and insufficient working capital 
certain of our international licensees and country representatives including in korea  malaysia  brazil  and to a lesser extent  europe have continued to experience significant material difficulties  including underperforming local sales and marketing efforts and the failure to pay us for our services 
to date  several of our licensees and country representatives have had difficulty in paying their usage fees and have not paid us or have paid us at reduced rates and in cases where collectability is not reasonably assured  we have not reflected invoices issued to such licensees and country representatives in our revenues or accounts receivable 
the ability of these international licensees and country representatives to pay their obligations to us may be dependent  in many cases  upon their ability to successfully restructure their business and operations or raise additional capital 
in addition  we have from time to time had disagreements with certain of our international licensees related to these operational and financial difficulties 
to the extent these international licensees and country representatives are unable to reorganize and or raise additional capital to execute their business plans on favorable terms or are delayed in doing so  our ability to offer services internationally and recognize revenue will be impaired and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
as a result of these difficulties experienced by our international licensees  we have and expect to continue to acquire their operations or gateway earth stations and  where permissible  seek to maintain control of international licensees through majority ownership 
although we have implemented a strategy for the acquisition of certain independent licensees and gateway earth station operators when circumstances permit  we may not be able to continue to implement this strategy on favorable terms and may not be able to realize the additional efficiencies that we anticipate from this strategy 
in some regions it is impracticable to acquire the independent gateway earth station operators either because local regulatory requirements or business norms do not permit an acquisition  because the expected revenue increase from an acquisition would be insufficient to justify the transaction  or because the independent gateway earth station operator will not sell at a price acceptable to us 
in those regions  our revenue and profits may be adversely affected if those independent gateway earth station operators do not fulfill their own business plans to increase substantially their sales of services and products 

table of contents while expanding our international operations would advance our growth  it would also increase numerous risks  including difficulties in penetrating new markets due to established and entrenched competitors  difficulties in developing products and services that are tailored to the needs of local customers  lack of local acceptance or knowledge of our products and services  lack of recognition of our products and services  unavailability of or difficulties in establishing relationships with distributors  significant investments  including the development  deployment and maintenance of dedicated gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure as certain countries require physical gateways within their jurisdiction to connect the traffic coming to and from their territory  instability of international economies and governments  changes in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions  exposure to varying legal standards  including intellectual property protection and foreign state ownership laws  in other jurisdictions  difficulties in obtaining required regulatory authorizations  difficulties in enforcing legal rights in other jurisdictions  local domestic ownership requirements  changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements  and foreign currency exchange rates and exchange controls 
these risks could affect our ability to successfully compete and expand internationally 
the prices for most of our products and services are denominated in us dollars 
any appreciation of the us dollar against other currencies will increase the cost of our products and services to our international customers and  as a result  may reduce the competitiveness of our international offerings and make it more difficult for us to grow internationally 
we currently are unable to offer near real time service in important regions of the world due to the absence of gateway earth stations in those areas  which is limiting our growth and our ability to compete 
our objective is to establish a worldwide service network  either directly or through independent gateway operators  but to date we have been unable to do so in certain areas of the world and we may not succeed in doing so in the future 
we have been unable to find capable independent gateway operators or otherwise obtain regulatory authorizations to install and operate gateway earth stations for several important regions and countries  including china  india  russia and certain parts of southeast asia 
this could reduce overall demand for our products and services and reduce the value of our services for potential users who require service in these areas 
a natural disaster could diminish our ability to provide communications service 
natural disasters could damage or destroy our gateway earth stations or our other ground based facilities resulting in a disruption of service to our customers in the affected region 
in addition  the collateral effects of such natural disasters could impair the functioning of our ground equipment 
if a natural disaster were to impair or destroy any of our ground facilities  we might be unable to provide service to our customers in the affected area for a period of time 
even if the gateway earth stations are not affected by natural disasters  our service could be disrupted if a natural disaster damages wireline or terrestrial wireless networks that we utilize  or disrupts our ability to connect to those networks 
such failure or service disruptions could harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents we rely on a limited number of manufacturers for our subscriber communicators 
if we are unable to  or cannot find third parties to  manufacture a sufficient quantity of subscriber communicators at a reasonable price  the prospects for our business will be negatively impacted 
the development and availability on a timely basis of relatively inexpensive subscriber communicators are critical to the successful commercial operation of our system 
our subsidiaries rely on contract manufacturers to produce subscriber communicators 
our japan subsidiary mainly relies on quake global  inc quake as its contract manufacturer for subscriber communicators  and our startrak logistics management solutions subsidiary relies on a few contract manufacturers for subscriber communicators 
our customers may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of subscriber communicators at price points or with functional characteristics and reliability that meet their needs 
an inability to successfully develop and manufacture subscriber communicators that meet the needs of customers and are available in sufficient numbers and at prices that render our services cost effective to customers could limit the acceptance of our system and potentially affect the quality of our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business may be materially and adversely affected if our subsidiaries relationship with these contract manufacturers is terminated or modified 
if our arrangements with third party manufacturers are terminated our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant delays  added expense and an inability to maintain or expand our customer base 
any of these events could require us to take unforeseen actions or devote additional resources to provide our services and could harm our ability to compete effectively 
there are currently two manufacturers of our satellite subscriber communicators  quake and digi international 
if our arrangements with third party manufacturers are terminated or expire  our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant delays in customers activating subscriber communicators on our communications system  added expense for our customers and our inability to maintain or expand our customer base 
we depend on recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so would seriously harm our business 
because of the technical nature of our services and the market in which we compete  our success depends on the continued services of our key personnel  including certain of our engineering personnel  and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our executive officers or key technical personnel 
competitors and others have in the past  and may in the future  attempt to recruit our employees 
the available pool of individuals with relevant experience in the satellite and telematics industries is limited  and the process of identifying and recruiting personnel with the skills necessary to operate our system and our startrak applications services can be lengthy and expensive 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training  which requires significant resources and management attention 
even if we invest significant resources to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts 
our management team is subject to a variety of demands for its attention and rapid growth which could further strain our management and other resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently face a variety of challenges  including maintaining the infrastructure and systems necessary for us to operate as a public company  addressing our potential litigation matters and managing the growth of our business 
our recent growth and expansion has increased the responsibilities of our management team 
any litigation  regardless of the merit or resolution  could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our 
table of contents management 
as we continue to expand  we may further strain our management and other resources 
our failure to meet these challenges as a result of insufficient management or other resources could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
pursuing strategic transactions may cause us to incur additional risks 
we may pursue additional acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic transactions on an opportunistic basis 
we may face costs and risks arising from any such transactions  including integrating a new business into our business or managing a joint venture 
these risks may include legal  organizational  financial  loss of key customers and distributors and diversion of management s time 
in addition  if we were to choose to engage in any major business combination or similar strategic transaction  we may require or cause us to seek significant external financing in connection with the transaction 
depending on market conditions  investor perceptions of our company and other factors  we may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms  in acceptable amounts or at appropriate times to implement any such transaction 
any such financing  if obtained  may further dilute existing stockholders 
we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder  consumer  antitrust  intellectual property infringement and other issues 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  including increases in demands for attention on our management team  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change and we may not be able to compete with new and emerging technologies 
we operate in the telecommunications and telematics industries  which are characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological change 
new and advanced technology which can perform essentially the same functions as our messaging and ais service though without global coverage  such as digital cellular networks gsm  g  g and lte  direct broadcast satellites  new deployed satellites of competing low earth orbit satellite systems and other forms of wireless transmission  are in various stages of development by others in the industry 
the telematics industry includes numerous companies developing technologies to compete with the products and services of our subsidiaries 
these technologies are being developed  supported and rolled out by entities that may have significantly greater resources than we do 
these technologies could adversely impact the demand for our products and services 
research and development by others may lead to technologies that render some or all of our services non competitive or obsolete in the future 
because we operate our telecommunications services in a highly regulated industry  we may be subjected to increased regulatory restrictions which could disrupt our service or increase our operating costs 
system operators and service providers are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of various countries and the rules and policies they adopt 
these rules and policies  among other things  establish technical parameters for the operation of facilities and subscriber communicators  determine the permissible uses of facilities and subscriber communicators  and establish the terms and conditions pursuant to which our international licensees and country representatives operate their facilities  including certain of the gateway earth stations and gateway control centers in our system 
these rules and policies may also require our international licensees and country representatives to cut off the data passing through the gateway earth stations or gateway control centers without notifying us or our end users  significantly disrupting the operation of our communications system 
these rules and policies may also impose regulatory constraints on the use of subscriber 
table of contents communicators within certain countries or territories 
international and domestic licensing and certification requirements may cause a delay in the marketing of our services and products  may impose costly fees and procedures on our international licensees and country representatives  and may give a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete with our international licensees and country representatives 
possible future changes to regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate may result in additional regulatory requirements or restrictions on the services and equipment we provide  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
although we believe that we or our international licensees and country representatives have obtained all the licenses required to conduct our business as it is operated today  we may not be able to obtain  modify or maintain such licenses in the future 
moreover  changes in international or domestic licensing and certification requirements may result in disruptions of our communications services or alternatively result in added operational costs  which could harm our business 
our use of certain orbital planes and radio frequency assignments  as licensed by the fcc  is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the itu 
in the event disputes arise during coordination  the itu s radio regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms and neither the itu specifically  nor does international law generally  provide clear remedies in this situation 
finally  our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  fees  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  fees  policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory environment  including with respect to prohibiting or limiting the distribution of real or near real time ais data 
our telecommunications business relies on our ability to maintain our fcc licenses 
our fcc licenses a license for the satellite constellation  separate licenses for the four us gateway earth stations and a blanket license for the subscriber communicators are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy certain conditions or to meet certain prescribed milestones 
our fcc satellite constellation license is valid until april and authorizes the continued operation of the first generation orbcomm satellites  the construction  launch and operation of a total of orbcomm next generation satellites  as well any required construction  launch and operation during the term of the license of additional technically identical replacement satellites 
the us gateway earth station and subscriber communicator licenses will expire in renewal applications for the gateway earth station and subscriber communicator licenses must be filed between and days prior to expiration 
although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license renewals  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact renew our fcc licenses in the future 
our current fcc space license the continuing operation of the first generation orbcomm satellites  the construction  launch and operation a total of orbcomm next generation satellites  and any required construction  launch and operation during the term of the license of additional technically identical replacement satellites 
based on changed circumstances relating  among other things  to launch vehicle availability  we have an application pending before the fcc to modify our space license to accommodate revisions to our next generation satellite deployment plan for the eighteen next generation satellites that snc is currently producing 
we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
we also believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  but we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
although the fcc has been positively disposed thus far towards granting our applications for license modifications and renewals  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact grant our currently pending application to modify our space license to accommodate our revised next generation satellite deployment plan 
additionally  there can be no assurance that  to the extent that any modification of our fcc licenses may be required in the future to address changed circumstances  that any related fcc applications we may file will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
if the fcc revokes or fails to renew our fcc licenses  or does not grant any future application we file to modify one or more of our licenses  or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our fcc licenses  any such circumstance could have a material adverse impact on our business 
finally  our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory environment 

table of contents our business would be harmed if our international licensees and country representatives fail to acquire and retain all necessary regulatory approvals  we are currently unable to offer service in important regions of the world due to regulatory requirements  which is limiting our growth and our ability to compete 
our business is affected by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which we operate 
due to foreign ownership restrictions in various jurisdictions around the world  obtaining and maintaining local regulatory approval for operation of our system is the responsibility of our international licensees and or country representatives in each of these licensed territories 
in addition  in certain countries regulatory frameworks may be rudimentary or in an early stage of development  which can make it difficult or impossible to license and operate our system in such jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that our international licensees  our country representatives and or us will be successful in obtaining or maintaining any additional approvals that may be desirable and  if these efforts are not successful  we will be unable to provide service in such countries 
our inability to offer service in one or more important new markets  particularly in china or india  could have a negative impact on our ability to generate more revenue and could diminish our business prospects 
our ability to provide service in certain regions is limited by local regulations as some countries  like china  india and russia  have specific regulatory requirements such as local domestic ownership requirements or requirements for physical gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure within their jurisdiction to connect traffic coming to and from their territory 
while we are currently in discussions with parties in these countries to satisfy these regulatory requirements  we may not be able find an acceptable local partner or reach an agreement to develop additional gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure or the cost of developing and deploying such infrastructure may be prohibitive  which could impair our ability to expand our product and service offerings in such areas and undermine our value for potential users who require service in these areas 
the inability to offer to sell our products and services in all major international markets could impair our international growth 
in addition  the construction of such gateway earth stations or other ground infrastructure in foreign countries may require us to comply with certain us regulatory requirements which may contravene the laws or regulations of the local jurisdiction 
there are numerous risks inherent to our international operations that are beyond our control 
international telecommunications services are subject to country and region risks 
most of our coverage area and some of our subsidiaries are outside the united states 
as a result  we are subject to certain risks on a country by country or region by region basis  including changes in domestic and foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  licensing requirements  tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and political and economic instability  including fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies which may make payment in us dollars more expensive for foreign customers or payment in foreign currencies less valuable for us 
certain of these risks may be greater in developing countries or regions  where economic  political or diplomatic conditions may be significantly more volatile than those commonly experienced in the united states and other industrialized countries 
we do not currently maintain in orbit or other insurance for our satellites 
we do not currently maintain in orbit insurance coverage for our satellites to address the risk of potential systemic anomalies  failures or catastrophic events affecting the existing satellite constellation 
we may obtain launch insurance for the launch of our next generation satellites 
however  any determination as to whether we procure insurance  including in orbit and launch insurance  will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of insurance in the market and the cost of available insurance 
we may not be able to obtain insurance at reasonable costs 
even if we obtain insurance  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses we may suffer due to applicable deductions and exclusions 
furthermore  launch insurance does not cover lost revenue 
the price  terms and availability of insurance have fluctuated significantly since we began offering commercial satellite services 
the cost of obtaining insurance can vary as a result of either satellite failures or 
table of contents general conditions in the insurance industry 
insurance policies on satellites may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition to higher premiums  insurance policies may provide for higher deductibles  shorter coverage periods and additional satellite health related policy exclusions 
an uninsured failure of one or more of our satellites could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  higher premiums on insurance policies would increase our costs  thereby reducing our operating income by the amount of such increased premiums 
moreover  if we were to determine in the future that the terms of any particular insurance is economically unfavorable or unfeasible after taking into account factors such as cost of the insurance and scope of insurance exclusions and limitations  we may elect to self insure against losses of such satellites 
even where we have obtained in orbit insurance for a satellite  this insurance coverage will not protect us against all losses that might arise as a result of a satellite failure 
any future policies can be expected to contain  specified exclusions and material change limitations customary in the industry at the time the policy is written 
these exclusions typically relate to losses resulting from acts of war  insurrection or military action  government confiscation  as well as lasers  directed energy beams  or nuclear or anti satellite devices or radioactive contamination 
in addition  should we wish to launch a spare satellite to replace a failed operational satellite  the timing of such launch will be dependent on prior commitments made by potential suppliers of launch services to other satellite operators 
our insurance does not protect us against lost or delayed revenue  business interruption or lost business opportunities 
we do not maintain third party liability insurance with respect to our satellites 
accordingly  we have no insurance to cover any third party damages that may be caused by any of our satellites 
if we experience significant uninsured losses  such events could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business relies on intellectual property  some of which third parties own and we or our customers may inadvertently infringe upon their patents and proprietary rights 
many entities  including some of our competitors  currently or may in the future hold patents and other intellectual property rights that cover or affect products or services related to those that we or our customers offer 
we cannot assure you that we are aware of all intellectual property rights that our products or that of our customers may infringe upon 
in general  if a court were to determine that one or more of our products or that of our customers infringes upon intellectual property held by others  we or our customers may be required to cease developing or marketing those products  to obtain licenses from the holders of the intellectual property  or to redesign those products in such a way as to avoid infringing upon others patents 
we cannot estimate the extent to which we or our customers may be required in the future to obtain intellectual property licenses  or the availability and cost of any such licenses 
to the extent that we are required to pay royalties to third parties to whom we are not currently making payments  these increased costs of doing business could negatively affect our profitability or liquidity 
if a competitor holds intellectual property rights  it may not allow us or our customers to use its intellectual property at any price  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
if we become subject to unanticipated domestic or foreign tax or fee liabilities  it could materially increase our costs 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions 
we believe that we have complied in all material respects with our obligations to pay taxes in these jurisdictions 
however  our position is subject to review and possible challenge by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions 
if the applicable taxing authorities were to challenge successfully our current tax positions  or if there were changes in the manner in which we conduct our activities  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  we could become subject to material unanticipated tax or fee liabilities 
we may also become subject to additional tax or fee liabilities as a result of changes in tax laws  which could in certain circumstances  have a retroactive effect 

table of contents our acquisition of the assets of startrak systems and par logistics management systems may expose us to additional risks 
we acquired substantially all of the assets of startrak systems llc and par logistics management system corporation 
the financing for these acquisitions diluted the interests of our stockholders and increased our indebtedness 
in addition  these acquisitions may entail numerous other risks  including difficulties in assimilating the operations or products of the acquired assets  including the loss of key employees and disruption to our existing business  diversion of management s attention from our satellite telecommunications and ais businesses  the expenses of the transactions  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  resistance by customers and prospects to accept the products and services acquired  obsolescence of existing product designs and installed base resulting from changes in technology offered by terrestrial cellular carriers  obstacles to development of new products and services resulting in delay or cancellation of development programs necessary to remain competitive in the telematics industry  and risks of operating in markets with products  software and services in which we have limited experience  our failure to successfully complete the integration of the acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
risks related to our technology new satellites are subject to launch failures  delays and cost overruns  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations and business 
satellites are subject to inherent risks related to failed or delayed launches and cost overruns 
cost overruns can be caused by a number of factors  including launch vehicle changes  new satellite dispenser systems and next generation enhancements 
launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites  and to obtain other launch opportunities 
launch delays can be caused by a number of factors  including delays in manufacturing satellites  preparing satellites for launch  securing appropriate launch vehicles or obtaining regulatory approvals 
we intend to conduct various satellite launches for our next generation satellites to augment the existing constellation in order to expand the messaging capacity of our network and improve the service level of our network 
any launch delays  or launch failures of our additional satellites could result in delays of at least six to nine months from the date of the launch failure until additional satellites under construction are completed and their launches are achieved 
such delays and cost overruns would have a negative impact on our future growth and would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our satellites have a limited operating life  all of our recently launched satellites have failed and others have degraded over time resulting in increased system latencies 
if we are unable to deploy replacement satellites  our services will be harmed and materially adversely affect our operations and business 
our first generation satellites were generally placed into orbit between and our first generation satellites have an average expected operating life of approximately nine to twelve years after giving effect to certain operational changes and software updates 
on june   we launched five of the six quick launch satellites together with our cds in a single mission to supplement and ultimately replace our existing plane a satellites 
in addition to supplementing and replacing our first generation satellites  these satellites were also intended to expand the capacity of our communications system 
during and  the cds and three quick launch satellites failed  and in  the remaining two quick launch satellites failed 
we consider a satellite 
table of contents failed only when it can no longer provide any communications service  and we do not intend to undertake further efforts to return it to service 
our plans to extend the operating life of our network are dependent on the health of our satellites and the failure of the cds and the quick launch satellites could eventually have a significant impact on the operating life of our network 
these satellite failures combined with the aging of our first generation satellites have resulted in increased system latencies  which have resulted and may continue to result in our customers or potential customers delaying deployments or using a competing wireless data network 
while we expect that our current constellation to provide a commercially acceptable level of satellite messaging service through the scheduled launch of our next generation satellites  we cannot guarantee we will be able to provide such level of service through such launches of our next generation satellites 
also  our satellites have already exceeded their original design lives and although actual design life typically exceeds original design life the actual remaining useful lives of our satellites may be shorter than we expect 
if we are unable to effectively develop and deploy our next generation satellites before our current constellation ceases to provide a commercially acceptable level of service  for any reason  including as a result of insufficient funds  manufacturing or launch delays  launch failures  in orbit satellite failures  inability to achieve or maintain orbital placement  failure of the satellites to perform as expected or delays in receiving regulatory approvals  or if we experience backward compatibility problems with our new constellation once deployed  we will likely lose customers and business opportunities to our competitors  resulting in a material decline in revenues and profitability as our ability to provide a commercially acceptable level of service is impaired 
in addition  because we acquired a fully operational satellite constellation and communications system from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries  our current senior management team has limited experience with managing the design  construction  launch  and in orbit testing and deployment of a satellite system 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the payload  bus and launch vehicle for our next generation satellites and any increased cost  delay or disruption in the supply of these components and related services will adversely affect our ability to replenish our satellite constellation and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we entered into an agreement with snc to design and manufacture next generation satellites 
in  we entered into a commercial launch services agreement with spacex to provide launch services using multiple spacex falcon e launch vehicles for the carriage into low earth orbit of our next generation satellites being constructed by snc 
we are discussing terms with spacex to an amended launch services agreement to provide launch services on multiple falcon launch vehicles instead of multiple falcon e launch vehicles 
while we expect to finalize the terms of an amended launch services agreement with spacex prior to the first scheduled launch in for the same cost as the existing agreement  we cannot ensure that it will be the case 
spacex has a limited operating history and limited financial resources  and the falcon rocket is a new launch vehicle with a limited launch history  which could expose us to delay  greater risk of launch failure or the need to utilize an alternate launch services provider  which could substantially increase our launch costs 
our reliance on these suppliers for their services involves significant risks and uncertainties  including whether our suppliers will provide an adequate supply of required components of sufficient quality  will charge the agreed upon prices or will perform their obligations on a timely basis 
if any of our suppliers becomes financially unstable  we may have to find a new supplier 
there are a limited number of suppliers for communication satellite components and related services and the lead time required to qualify a new supplier may take several months 
there are only a limited number of suppliers to launch our satellites 
there is no assurance that a new supplier will be found on a timely basis  or at all  if any one of our suppliers ceases to supply their services for our satellites or cease to provide launch services 
any delay or continuing delays in our launch schedule could adversely affect our ability to provide communications services  particularly as the health of our current satellite constellation declines  and we could lose current or prospective customers as a result of service interruptions 
the loss of any of our suppliers or delay in our launch schedule or any significant increase in costs in our next generation satellite program could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents once launched and properly deployed  our satellites are subject to significant operating risks due to various types of potential anomalies 
satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and  accordingly  are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions  or anomalies  that may occur in our satellites 
some of the principal satellite anomalies include mechanical failures due to manufacturing error or defect  including mechanical failures that degrade the functionality of a satellite  such as the failure of solar array panel deployment mechanisms  antenna failures that degrade the communications capability of the satellite  circuit failures that reduce the power output of the solar array panels on the satellites  failure of the battery cells that power the payload and spacecraft operations during daily solar eclipse periods  power system failures that result in a shut down or loss of the satellite  attitude control system failures that degrade or cause the inoperability of the satellite  transmitter or receiver failures that degrade or cause the inability of the satellite to communicate with subscriber communicator units or gateway earth stations  communications system failures that affect overall system capacity  and satellite computer or processor failures that impair or cause the inoperability of the satellites 
equipment degradation during the satellite s lifetime  including degradation of the batteries ability to accept a full charge  degradation of solar array panels due to radiation  and general degradation resulting from operating in the harsh space environment 
deficiencies of control or communications software  including failure of the charging algorithm that may damage the satellite s batteries  problems with the communications and messaging servicing functions of the satellite  and limitations on the satellite s digital signal processing capability that limit satellite communications capacity 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  anomalies in some of the categories described above 
the effects of these anomalies include  but are not limited to  failure of the satellite  degraded communications performance  reduced power available to the satellite in sunlight and or eclipse  battery overcharging or undercharging and limitations on satellite communications capacity 
some of these effects may be increased during periods of greater message traffic and could result in our system requiring more than one attempt to send messages before they get through to our satellites 
although these effects do not result in lost messages  they could lead to increased messaging latencies for the end user and reduced throughput for our system 
see the orbcomm communications system system status network capacity for a description of our network capacity 
while we have already implemented a number of system adjustments we cannot assure you that these actions will succeed or adequately address the effects of any anomalies in a timely manner or at all 
a total of first generation satellites were launched by orbcomm global lp and of these  a total of remain operational 
our plane f polar satellite  one of the original prototype first generation satellites 
table of contents launched in  was retired in april due to intermittent service 
two additional satellites one from each of plane b and plane d were retired in also due to intermittent service 
the other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures early in their lifetime and the previous mission ending satellite failure affecting our system occurred in october  prior to our acquisition of the satellite constellation 
the absence of these eight satellites can increase system latency and decrease overall capacity 
while certain software deficiencies may be corrected remotely  most  if not all  of the satellite anomalies or debris collision damage cannot be corrected once the satellites are placed in orbit 
see the orbcomm communications system system status first generation for a description of the operational status and anomalies that affect our satellites 
we may experience additional anomalies in the future  whether of the types described above or arising from the failure of other systems or components  and operational redundancy may not be available upon the occurrence of such an anomaly 
our products and services could fail to perform or perform at reduced levels of service because of technological malfunctions  satellite failures or deficiencies or events outside of our control  which would seriously harm our business and reputation 
our products and services are exposed to the risks inherent in a large scale  complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology 
any disruption to our services  information systems or communication networks or those of third parties into which our network connects could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time 
satellite anomalies and other technical and operational deficiencies of our communications system described in this annual report on form k could result in system failures or reduced levels of service 
in addition  certain components of our system are located in foreign countries  and as a result  are potentially subject to governmental  regulatory or other actions in such countries which could force us to limit the operations of  or completely shut down  components of our system  including gateway earth stations or subscriber communicators 
any disruption to our services or extended periods of reduced levels of service could  and increased latencies in our satellite network delivering messages have and could continue to  cause us to lose customers or revenue  result in delays or cancellations of future implementations of our products and services  result in failure to attract customers or could result in litigation  customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating our business 
the failure of any of the diverse and dispersed elements of our system  including our satellites  our network control center or backup control center  our gateway earth stations  our gateway control centers or our subscriber communicators  to function and coordinate as required could render our system unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success 
any system failures  repeated product failures  shortened product life or extended reduced levels of service could reduce our sales  increase costs or result in warranty or liability claims and seriously harm our business 
all operational satellites are subject to the possibility to be impacted by space debris or another spacecraft 
collisions with space debris or other spacecraft  could materially affect system performance and our business 
our satellites do not have the ability to actively maneuver to avoid potential impact by space debris or other satellites 
on february  a satellite owned by iridium satellite llc and russia s cosmos collided in an orbital altitude similar to ours causing an increase in risk of space debris damaging or interfering with the operation of our satellites 
much of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateway earth stations was designed and manufactured over ten years ago and could be more difficult and expensive to service  upgrade or replace 
much of the hardware and software we use in operating our gateway earth stations was designed and manufactured over ten years ago and portions are becoming obsolete 
as they continue to age  they may become less reliable and will be more difficult and expensive to service  upgrade or replace 
although we maintain inventories of some spare parts  it nonetheless may be difficult or impossible to obtain all necessary replacement parts for the hardware 
our business plan contemplates updating or replacing some of the hardware and software 
table of contents in our network  however  the age of our existing hardware and software may present us with technical and operational challenges that complicate or otherwise make it not feasible to carry out our planned upgrades and replacements  and the expenditure of resources  both from a monetary and human capital perspective  may exceed our estimates 
without upgrading and replacing our equipment  obsolescence of the technologies that we use could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and liquidity 
technical or other difficulties with our gateway earth stations could harm our business 
our system relies in part on the functionality of our gateway earth stations  some of which are owned and maintained by third parties 
while we believe that the overall health of the majority of our gateway earth stations remains stable  we have and may continue to experience technical difficulties or parts obsolescence with our gateway earth stations which negatively impact service in the region covered by that gateway earth station 
certain problems with these gateway earth stations have and may continue to reduce their availability and negatively impact the performance of our system in that region 
in addition  due to regulatory and licensing constraints in certain countries in which we operate  we are unable to wholly own or majority own some of the gateway earth stations in our system located outside the united states 
as a result of these ownership restrictions  we rely on third parties to own and operate some of these gateway earth stations 
if our relationship with these third parties deteriorates or if these third parties are unable or unwilling to bear the cost of operating or maintaining the gateway earth stations  or if there are changes in the applicable domestic regulations that require us to give up any or all of our ownership interests in any of the gateway earth stations  our control over our system could be diminished and our business could be harmed 
rapid and significant technological changes in the satellite communications industry may impair our competitive position and require us to make significant additional capital expenditures 
the space and communications industries are subject to rapid advances and innovations in technology 
we expect to face competition in the future from companies using new technologies and new satellite systems 
new technology could render our system obsolete or less competitive by satisfying customer demand in more attractive ways or through the introduction of incompatible standards 
particular technological developments that could adversely affect us include the deployment by our competitors of new satellites with greater power  flexibility  efficiency or capabilities than our current constellation or our next generation satellites  as well as continuing improvements in terrestrial wireless technologies 
for us to keep up with technological changes and remain competitive  we may need to make significant capital expenditures 
customer acceptance of the products and services that we offer will continually be affected by technology based differences in our product and service offerings compared to those of our competitors 
new technologies may be protected by patents or other intellectual property laws and therefore may not be available to us 
any failure by us to implement new technology within our system may compromise our ability to compete 
our networks and data processing systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security risks 
we expect the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks to continue to be a critical element of our operations 
our network and those of our third party service providers and our customers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other security problems 
the data processing systems used to provide the telematics services of our startrak subsidiaries may likewise be vulnerable 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully obtain or use information on the network or cause interruptions  delays or malfunctions in our operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems  including reputational harm and litigation  caused by any breaches 
although we have implemented and intend to continue to implement security measures  these measures may prove to be inadequate and result in system failures and delays that could lower network operations center availability  which could harm our business 

table of contents the failure of our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or results of operations 
the operation of our business depends on its information technology systems 
we rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage  among other things  our business data  communications  supply chain  inventory management  customer order entry and order fulfillment  processing transactions  summarizing and reporting results of operations  human resources benefits and payroll management  complying with regulatory  legal or tax requirements and other processes and data necessary to manage our business 
we use technology to provide secure transmission of confidential information  including our business data and customer information 
to achieve our strategic objectives and to remain competitive  we must continue to develop and enhance our information systems 
this may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development  either internally or through independent consultants  of new proprietary software 
our inability to design  develop  implement and utilize  in a cost effective manner  information systems that provide the capabilities necessary for us to compete effectively  could make us less competitive  increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
the failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in  among other things  transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  loss of data and the loss of sales and customers  which could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control  including  without limitation  fire  natural disasters  power outages  systems failure  system conversions  security breaches  cyber attacks  viruses and or human error 
in any such event  we could be required to make a significant investment to fix or replace its information technology systems  and we could experience interruptions in its ability to service our customers 
any such damage or interruption could adversely affect on our business  financial condition and or results of operations

we process large amounts of customer information 
our software products also enable our customers to store and process data 
we have included security features in our products and processes that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of data  including confidential client data 
security for our products and processes is critical given the confidential nature of the information contained in our systems

table of contents risks related to an investment in our common stock the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile and your investment may decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
further  our common stock has a limited trading history

in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for telecommunications companies in particular  have experienced and continue to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation has previously been instituted against us and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
in  two securities firms ceased providing 
table of contents research coverage of our company and our business 
in  one additional securities firm ceased providing such research coverage 
if we do not continue to maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions which could affect the price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions do not permit actions by our stockholders by written consent and require the approval of the holders of at least of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
in addition  these provisions include procedural requirements relating to stockholder meetings and stockholder proposals that could make stockholder actions more difficult 
our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors serving staggered  three year terms and may be removed only for cause 
any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the vote of the majority of directors then in office 
our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer  effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more for our outstanding common stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company 
the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect our stock price 
we may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities  resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our current stockholders 
we are authorized to issue million shares of common stock  of which approximately million shares of voting common stock were issued and outstanding as of december  and million were available for future issuance 
the potential issuance of such additional shares of common stock  whether directly or pursuant to any conversion right of any convertible securities  may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
we may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock for capital raising or other business purposes 
future sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we have issued and may issue shares of preferred stock or debt securities with greater rights than our common stock 
subject to the rules of the nasdaq stock market  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from holders of our common stock 
currently  there are million shares of preferred stock authorized and approximately  shares of series a convertible preferred stock are issued 
any preferred stock that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends  priority and liquidation premiums and may have greater voting rights than holders of our common stock 
if persons engage in short sales of our common stock  the price of our common stock may decline 
selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security 
a significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of 
table of contents time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security 
further sales of common stock could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market  which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock 
holders of our securities could  therefore  experience a decline in the value of their investment as a result of short sales of our common stock 
we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and  because we currently intend to retain all cash we generate to fund the growth of our business  we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any future dividend payments would be within the discretion of our board of directors and would depend on a variety of factors  including our results of operations  working capital requirements  capital expenditure requirements  financial condition  contractual restrictions  business opportunities  anticipated cash needs  provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
we may not generate sufficient cash from operations in the future to pay dividends on our common stock

organization orbcomm llc was organized as a delaware limited liability company on april  and on april   we acquired substantially all of the non cash assets and assumed certain liabilities of orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries  which had filed for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the assets acquired from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries consisted principally of the in orbit satellites and supporting us ground infrastructure equipment that we own today 
at the same time  orbcomm llc also entered an agreement that resulted in the acquisition of the fcc licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of orbital sciences corporation  which was not in bankruptcy  in a related transaction 
prior to april   orbcomm llc did not have any operating activities 
we were formed as a delaware corporation in october and on february   the members of orbcomm llc contributed all of their outstanding membership interests in orbcomm llc to us in exchange for shares of our common stock  representing ownership interests in us equal in proportion to their prior ownership interest in orbcomm llc 
as a result of  and immediately following the contribution  orbcomm llc became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
overview we operate a global commercial wireless messaging system optimized for narrowband communications 
our system consists of a global network of low earth orbit  or leo satellites  ais microsatellites and accompanying ground infrastructure 
our two way communications system enables our customers and end users  which include large and established multinational businesses and government agencies  to track  monitor  control 
table of contents and communicate cost effectively with fixed and mobile assets located worldwide 
we also provide terrestrial based cellular communication services through reseller agreements with major cellular wireless providers 
currently  our agreements with major cellular providers include gsm and cdma offerings in the united states and gsm services with significant coverage worldwide 
these terrestrial based communication services enable our customers who have higher bandwidth requirements to receive and send messages from communication devices based on terrestrial based technologies using the cellular providers wireless networks as well as from dual mode devices combining our satellite subscriber communicators with devices for terrestrial based technologies 
as a result  our customers are now able to integrate into their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to send and receive messages  including data intensive messaging using the cellular providers wireless networks 
our products and services enable our customers and end users to enhance productivity  reduce costs and improve security through a variety of commercial  government  and emerging homeland security applications 
we enable our customers and end users to achieve these benefits using a single global satellite technology standard for machine to machine and telematic  or mm  data communications 
our customers have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
examples of assets that are connected through our mm data communications system include trucks  trailers  railcars  containers  heavy equipment  fluid tanks  utility meters  and pipeline monitoring equipment  marine vessels  and oil wells 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as caterpillar inc  caterpillar  doosan infracore america  hitachi construction machinery co  ltd  hitachi  hyundai heavy industries  komatsu ltd  komatsu  the manitowoc company and volvo construction equipment 
in addition  we market our services through a distribution network of vertical market technology integrators known as vars and ivars  such as ai  xata corporation and american innovations  ltd  and us government agencies 
as a result of our acquisition of the net assets of startrak systems  llc or startrak on may   we began providing customers with the ability to proactively monitor  manage and remotely control their refrigerated transport assets 
with the acquisition of the net assets of par logistics management systems corporation or lms on january   we are further able to provide complete end to end solutions for refrigerated and non refrigerated transport assets 
these solutions enable optimal business efficiencies  increased asset utilization  repositioning mitigation  and substantially reduce asset write offs and manual yard counts of chassis  refrigeration units  containers and gensets 
through increased asset visibility and management  these systems allow shipping  rail  and leasing companies to decrease their fleet sizes of chassis  gensets  refrigeration units and containers 
their information services also help industry leaders realize better fleet efficiency and utilization while reducing risk by adding safety monitoring of perishable cargo 
in addition to relationships with leading refrigerated unit manufacturers such as carrier and thermo king  and customers who include well known brands such as tropicana  maersk line  prime inc  cr england  ffe transport  inc target  chiquita  ryder  jb hunt  hapag lloyd  golden state foods  martin brower and exel transportation 
as of december   we had approximately  billable subscriber communicators compared to approximately  billable subscriber communicators as of december   an increase of 
satellite replenishments our current fleet of satellites was generally put in service in the late s and has an estimated operating life of approximately nine to twelve years 
since  we have implemented several operational changes and software demonstration updates that we believe have enhanced the expected life of the satellites 
the majority of these changes focus on extending the life of the primary life limiting component the nickel hydrogen batteries which power the satellites 
next generation satellites through a series of launches  we intend to replenish the existing constellation of satellites with next generation satellites  which depending on the capabilities of the replacement satellites  may require fewer satellites than we currently have 

table of contents we intend to launch next generation satellites equipped with increased communications capabilities and our ais payload currently being constructed by snc with the first of several launches using multiple spacex launch vehicles based on our agreement with spacex  our launch service provider 
we anticipate that the launch services will be performed between and  subject to certain rights of us and the launch service provider to reschedule any of the following launch services as needed 
the agreement also provides us the option to procure  prior to each launch service  reflight launch services whereby in the event the applicable launch service results in a failure due to the spacex launch vehicle  our launch service provider will provide comparable reflight launch services at no additional cost to us beyond the initial option price for such reflight launch services 
ais microsatellites on september   we entered into an ais satellite agreement with ohb pursuant to which ohb  through its affiliate lxs  will design  construct  launch and in orbit test two ais microsatellites and design and construct the required ground support equipment 
under the ais satellite agreement  we obtained exclusive licenses for all data with certain exceptions as defined in the ais satellite agreement collected or transmitted by the two ais microsatellites including all ais data during the term of the ais satellite agreement and nonexclusive licenses for all ais data collected or transmitted by another microsatellite expected to be launched by lxs 
in october  the first of two ais microsatellites was launched and was placed in service in december and is providing full commercial service 
in january  the second ais microsatellite was launched and placed into full commercial service in february acquisitions startrak systems  llc effective on the close of business on may   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of startrak  a wholly owned subsidiary of alanco technologies  inc  alanco including but not limited to cash  accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  intellectual property  all of startrak s rights to customer contracts  supplier lists and assumed certain liabilities pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of february  the consideration paid to acquire startrak was valued at million consisting of i cash subject to a final working capital adjustment  which has not yet been finalized  ii forgiveness of the secured promissory note advanced by us to alanco on february   iii note payable issued to a lender and stockholder of alanco  iv common stock  v series a convertible preferred stock and vi delivery of our investment in preferred stock and common stock of alanco back to alanco 
in addition to the consideration paid  up to an additional gross amount of million subject to certain reductions in contingent payments is payable by us if certain revenue milestones of startrak are achieved for the calendar year 
the initial estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration was nil 
the estimated fair value of the earn out was determined using weighted probabilities to achieve the revenue milestones discounted at 
any change in the fair value of the contingent earn out subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  will be recognized in earnings in the period the estimated fair value changes 
for the year ended december  there were no changes to the fair value of the contingent earn out amount as startrak did not achieve the revenue milestones for the calendar year 
as a result of the acquisition of startrak  we recognized million of goodwill and million of intangible assets 
the acquired goodwill will not be amortized for financial reporting purposes 
however the acquired goodwill is tax deductible  and therefore amortized over fifteen years for income tax purposes 
as such  deferred income tax expense and a deferred tax liability arise as a result of the difference in tax deductibility of 
table of contents this amount for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the resulting deferred tax liability  which is expected to continue to increase over time will remain on our balance sheet indefinitely unless there is an impairment of the asset 
the acquired intangible assets consist of technology and patents  customer relationships and trademarks which are being amortized over years 
the results of operations of startrak are included in our consolidated results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date of may  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
par logistics management systems corporation effective on the close of business on january   we completed the acquisition of the assets of par logistics management systems corporation  lms  a wholly owned subsidiary of par technology corporation  including but not limited to  accounts receivable  inventory  equipment  intellectual property  all of lms s rights to customer contracts  supplier lists and assumed certain liabilities pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of december  as this acquisition was effective on january   the results of operations of lms will be included our consolidated financial statements beginning january  the consideration paid to acquire lms was valued at million  consisting of million in cash subject to a final working capital adjustment and the issuance of  shares of common stock valued at million 
in addition to the consideration paid  up to additional million in contingent payments is payable to par technology corporation 
up to million will be payable based on achieving certain agreed upon new subscriber targets for calendar year and up to million will be payable based on achieving certain agreed upon sales targets for calendar years through see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings attributable to orbcomm inc  before interest income expense  provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to our management and investors in evaluating our operating performance because it is one of the primary measures we use to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations  including our ability to obtain and maintain our customers  our ability to operate our business effectively  the efficiency of our employees and the profitability associated with their performance 
it also helps our management and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period on a consistent basis by removing the impact of our financing transactions and the depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from our operating results 
in addition  our management uses ebitda in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management and for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget 
ebitda is not a performance measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
while we consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  net loss or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different than ebitda measures presented by other companies 

table of contents the following table reconciles our net loss to ebitda for the periods shown years ended december  in thousands net loss attributable to orbcomm inc income tax expense benefit interest income interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda in improved million over the improvement was primarily due to increases in service revenues of million and product revenues of million and a non cash impairment charge of million in discontinued operations to write down net assets held for sale in the increase in service revenues was primarily due to an increase in satellite and terrestrial revenues of million including million of incremental revenue from startrak  offset by a reduction in ais revenue of million which included a one time recognition in of the remaining unamortized ais deferred service revenue of million prepaid by the uscg 
product revenues included million from startrak 
the increase in total revenues was offset by an increase in expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  of million primarily due to a non cash impairment charge to satellite network of million in and million in expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  from startrak and million of acquisition related costs and losses 
ebitda in decreased by million over primarily due to a net gain in of million on an insurance settlement  and non cash impairment charges of million and million related to the sale of stellar in discontinued operations  offset by higher net service revenues of million of which million is related to recognizing the remaining unamortized ais deferred professional services revenues that was prepaid by the uscg 
revenues we derive service revenues from our resellers and direct customers from utilization of satellite subscriber communicators and the reselling of airtime from a third party satellite system and the utilization of terrestrial based subscriber communicators using sims on the cellular providers wireless networks 
these service revenues generally consist of a one time activation fee for each subscriber communicator and sims activated for use and monthly usage fees 
usage fees that we charge our customers are based upon the number  size and frequency of data transmitted by the customer and the overall number of subscriber communicators and sims activated by each customer 
revenues for usage fees from currently billing subscriber communicators and sims are recognized on an accrual basis  as services are rendered  or on a cash basis  if collection from the customer is not reasonably assured at the time the service is provided 
usage fees charged to our resellers and direct customers are charged primarily at wholesale rates based on the overall number of subscriber communicators activated by them and the total amount of data transmitted 
we also earn service revenues from extended warranty service agreements extending beyond the initial warranty period of one year  royalty fees from third parties for the use of our proprietary communications protocol charged on a one time basis for each satellite subscriber communicator connected to our mm data communications system and fees from providing engineering  technical and management support services to customers 
service revenues in and also include ais data transmissions  services to the uscg described below 
we derive product revenues primarily from sales of subscriber communicators to our resellers ie  our vars  ivars  international licensees and country representatives and direct customers 
we also sell cellular 
table of contents wireless subscriber identity modules  or sims  for our terrestrial communication services to our resellers and direct customers 
shipping costs billed to customers are included in product sales revenues and the related costs are included as costs of product sales 
amounts received prior to the performance of services under customer contracts are recognized as deferred revenues and revenue recognition is deferred until such time that all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
during  we entered into an agreement with the uscg to design  develop  launch and operate a single satellite equipped with the capability to receive  process and forward ais data the concept validation project 
under the terms of the agreement  title to the concept validation project demonstration satellite remained with us  however the uscg was granted a non exclusive  royalty free license to use the intellectual property related to the designs  processes and procedures developed under the agreement in connection with any of our future satellites that are ais enabled 
we were permitted to use the concept validation project demonstration satellite 
the agreement provided for post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services were provided by us to the uscg for an initial term of months and an additional option to receive post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services subsequent to the initial term 
in  the uscg elected to receive the additional post launch maintenance and ais data transmissions services options for months to continue receiving service from the remaining two quick launch satellites 
on august   our agreement with the uscg was completed 
we terminated ais data transmission and maintenance services to the uscg the following day 
we do not know when or if another agreement will be reached to provide ais data services to the uscg 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables effective january   we adopted asu no 
 revenue recognition  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the impact on adopting asu no 
did not have an impact on the timing or pattern of revenue recognition as sales of subscriber communicators and sims are not bundled with service arrangements 
as a result  of our acquisition of startrak on may   startrak enters into arrangements with customers that include multiple deliverables  which typically include subscriber communicators  monthly usage fees and optional extended warranty service agreements 
the guidance for an arrangement with multiple deliverables states that the delivered items will be considered a separate unit of accounting if the following criteria are met the delivered item s have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items s and delivery of the undelivered item s is probable and in the control of the vendor 
deliverables which do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
we have determined that all of the deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting 
under asc no 
 at the inception of an agreement  we allocate revenue to each element in a multiple element arrangement based upon their relative selling price 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  if it exists  or third party evidence of selling price tpe if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor tpe exists for a deliverable  estimated selling price esp is used 
we limit the amount of revenue 
table of contents recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional products or services or the meeting of any specified performance conditions 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
vsoe is the price charged when the same or similar product or service is sold separately ie  on a standalone basis 
tpe is generally the price at which a competitor or third party sells the same or a similar and largely interchangeable deliverable on a standalone basis 
tpe may also include a company s standalone selling price for a similar and largely interchangeable product or service but not the same product or service 
esp is defined as the price which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
we have determined that esp represents the best estimate of the selling prices for each of the deliverables 
the determination was based upon management approved pricing guidelines  which consider multiple factors including gross margin objectives  competitive and market conditions and ongoing pricing strategy 
we do not currently expect a material impact in the near term from changes in esp 
costs and expenses we operate a satellite constellation  ten of the fifteen gateway earth stations  two ais earth stations  and two of the four gateway control centers 
satellite based communications systems are typically characterized by high initial capital expenditures and relatively low marginal costs for providing service 
because we acquired substantially all of our existing satellite and network assets from orbcomm global lp for a fraction of their original cost in a bankruptcy court approved sale  we have benefited from lower amortization of capital costs than if the assets were acquired at orbcomm global lp s original cost 
these satellites became fully depreciated during the fourth quarter of we currently anticipate that when the next generation satellites are placed in service they will be depreciated over a period of ten years representing the estimated operational lives of the satellites 
ais microsatellites will be depreciated over a period of five years  the estimated operational lives 
satellite impairments and insurance recovery on june   the coast guard demonstration satellite and five quick launch satellites were launched 
due to continued delays associated with the construction of the final quick launch satellite  we were retaining it for future deployment 
communications capability for all of the quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite that were launched in june were lost and we impaired the full cost of quick launch satellite  in september  coincident with the signing of the ais deployment agreement 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million relating to quick launch satellite in our consolidated statements of operations in in  we recognized non cash impairment charges of million relating to the three quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite that were launched in june in our consolidated statements of operations 
in august  we placed the remaining two quick launch satellites in service and began depreciating these satellites over their expected useful lives of three and five months as these two satellites were experiencing similar anomalies to the three quick launch satellites and the coast guard demonstration satellite were expected to be permanent and significantly reduce their expected useful lives 
as a result our depreciation expense  a component of cost of services  increased significantly in this was primarily due to million of depreciation expense relating to the two remaining quick launch satellites 
these satellites were fully depreciated as of december  in  we lost contact with these two remaining quick launch satellites 
we purchased an in orbit insurance policy that covers the total loss or constructive total loss of the coast guard demonstration satellite and five quick launch satellites during the coverage period that ended on june  under the terms of the policy  a satellite that does not meet the working satellite criteria constitutes a constructive total loss of that satellite for insurance purposes 
the in orbit insurance was subject to certain 
table of contents exclusions including a deductible under which no claim is payable under the policy for the first satellite to suffer a constructive total loss or total loss 
we filed a claim under our in orbit insurance policy for all six satellites as either a total loss or constructive total loss 
the total loss claim was for the one satellite that suffered a power system failure resulting in loss of contact in february  and the constructive total loss claim for each of the other five satellites was on the basis that these satellites did not meet the working satellite criteria stated in the policy 
the maximum amount recoverable by us under the policy from third party insurers for all six satellites covered by the policy was million  after taking into account the one satellite deductible  under which no claim is payable for the first satellite to suffer a constructive total loss or total loss  and less any salvage value that can be established for the insured satellites 
in december  we entered into a settlement and release agreement with the third party insurers with respect to our in orbit insurance policy and received million 
we recorded the million as an insurance recovery satellite network in our consolidated statements of operations 
acquisition costs and loss on other investment acquisition related costs directly relate to the acquisitions of startrak and lms 
these costs include professional services expenses 
for the year ended december  acquisition related costs were million 
in connection with the acquisition of startrak  we recognized a loss of million on the disposition of our investment in alanco for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value 
the amount of the loss was recorded in other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations for year ended december  discontinued operations on august   stellar satellite communications  ltd 
stellar entered into an asset purchase agreement with quake global  inc quake  a manufacturer of satellite communicators 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  quake purchased inventory  equipment  intellectual property and assumed certain liabilities 
in  we wrote down the net assets for sale by million to the estimated selling price of stellar 
operating expenses we incur engineering expenses associated with the operation of our communications system and the development and support of new applications  as well as sales  marketing and administrative expenses related to the operation of our business 
as of december   we have employees and we do expect a significant increase in  as a result of the acquisition of lms 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  accounting for business combinations  goodwill  satellite network and other equipment  long lived assets  capitalized development costs  income taxes  warranty costs  loss contingencies  pre acquisition contingencies and the value of securities underlying stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on 
table of contents our results of operations and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policy requires us to make significant judgments regarding the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance based on prior history and the creditworthiness of our customers 
in instances where collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when we receive cash from the customer 
revenues from the activation of subscriber communicators and sims are initially recorded as deferred revenues and are  thereafter  recognized ratably over the term of the agreement with the customer  generally four years which is the estimated customer relationship period 
revenues generated from monthly usage and administrative fees and engineering services are recognized when the services are rendered 
revenues generated from extended warranty service agreements extending beyond the initial warranty period of one year are initially recorded as deferred revenues and are  thereafter  recognized ratably over the term of the agreements generally two to five years 
revenues generated from royalties under our subscriber communicator manufacturing agreements are recognized when we issue to a third party manufacturer upon request a unique serial number to be assigned to each unit manufactured by such third party manufacturer 
revenues generated from the sale of satellite subscriber communicators  sims and other products are either recognized when the products are shipped or when customers accept the products  depending on the specific contractual terms 
sales of subscriber communicators and sims and other items are not subject to return and title and risk of loss pass to the customer at the time of shipment 
in arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we make significant estimates and judgments with the determination of revenue to be recognized 
these significant estimates and judgments include identifying the various elements in an arrangement  determining if the delivered items have stand alone value and the relative selling prices 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are due in accordance with payment terms included in our negotiated contracts 
amounts due are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we make ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable to determine our required allowances based on a number of factors such as the age of the receivable  credit history of the customer  historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
past experience may not be indicative of future collections  as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts may deviate from our estimates as a percentage of accounts receivable and sales 
satellite network and other equipment satellite network and other equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we use judgment to determine the useful life of our satellite network based on the estimated operational life of the satellites and periodic reviews of engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network 
satellite network includes the costs of our constellation of satellites  and the ground and control facilities  which consists of gateway earth stations  gateway control centers and the network control center the ground component 

table of contents assets under construction primarily consist of milestone payments pursuant to procurement agreements  which include the design  development  launch and other direct costs relating to the construction of the satellites and upgrades to the company s infrastructure and the ground component 
once these assets are placed in service they will be transferred to satellite network and then depreciation will be recognized using the straight line method over the estimated lives of the assets 
no depreciation has been recorded on these assets as of december  we capitalize interest on our note payable issued in during the construction period of our next generation satellites 
capitalized interest is added to the cost of our next generation satellites 
accounting for business combinations we accounted for the acquisition of startrak pursuant to fasb topic asc  business combinations 
in accordance with asc  the estimated purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill 
we have made significant assumptions and estimates in determining the preliminary estimated purchase price and the preliminary allocation of the estimated purchase in the consolidated financial statements 
these preliminary estimates and assumptions are subject to change as we finalize the valuations of certain assets and liabilities  including deferred revenues and warranty liabilities  intangible assets  goodwill and the final working capital adjustment 
the final valuations may change significantly from the preliminary estimates 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based  in part  on historical experience  information obtained from the management of the acquired company and future expectations 
we anticipate finalizing the purchase price allocation during the first quarter of examples of critical estimates in accounting for the acquisition of startrak include but are not limited to we estimated the fair value of the contingent earn out consideration using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based upon the expected achievement of the revenue milestones  the future expected cash flows from revenues of acquired technology and the patents and trademarks  the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets acquired  and the discount rates 
pre acquisition contingencies we have evaluated and continue to evaluate pre acquisition contingencies related to startrak that existed as of the acquisition date 
if these pre acquisition contingencies that existed as of the acquisition date become probable of occurring and can be estimated during the remainder of the measurement period  amounts recorded for such matters will be made in the measurement period to goodwill and  subsequent to the measurement period  in our results of operations 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the underlying net tangible and intangible assets of startrak 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
we operate in one operating segment which is our only reporting unit 
goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment and compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to 
table of contents measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step is used to measure the amount of impairment loss and compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we periodically analyze whether any such indicators of impairment exist 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators include a sustained and significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate and unanticipated competition 
on november   we performed our annual review of goodwill and the fair value of the reporting value of our single reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value and therefore was not at risk of failing step one 
long lived assets management reviews long lived assets for impairment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in connection with this review  we reevaluate the periods of depreciation and amortization 
we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is determined using the projected discounted future net cash flows 
we measure fair value by discounting estimated future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
considerable judgment by us is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows 
capitalized development costs judgments and estimates occur in the calculation of capitalized development costs 
we evaluate and estimate when a preliminary project stage is completed and at the point when the project is substantially complete and ready for use 
we base our estimates and evaluations on engineering data 
we capitalize the costs of acquiring  developing and testing software to meet our internal needs 
capitalization of costs associated with software obtained or developed for internal use commences when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has authorized further funding for the project  based on a determination that it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct cost of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with  and devote time to  the internal use software project 
capitalization of such costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
internal use software costs are amortized once the software is placed in service using the straight line method over periods ranging from one to five years 
income taxes we estimate our income taxes separately for each tax jurisdiction in which we conduct operations 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items between book and tax which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in determining the net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  we are required to make judgments and estimates in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 

table of contents we account for uncertainly in income tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting for uncertainties in income taxes positions involves significant judgments by management 
during the years ended december   and  we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
we are subject to us federal and state examinations by tax authorities for all years from we do not expect any significant changes to its unrecognized tax positions during the next twelve months 
warranty costs as a result of our acquisition of startrak on may   we acquired warranty obligations on startrak s product sales  which provide for costs to replace or fix the product 
one year warranty coverage is accrued on product sales which provide for costs to replace or fix the product 
our analysis of the warranty liabilities associated with the one year warranty coverage are estimated based on historical costs of startrak to replace or fix products for customers  and additional liability for warranty coverage for other specific claims that are expected to be incurred within the next twelve months  for which it is estimated that customers may have a warranty claim 
these warranty liabilities have not yet been fair valued 
as we continue to gather additional information  these accrual estimates may differ from actual results and adjustments to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we will continue to evaluate warranty liabilities relating to the acquisition of startrak throughout the measurement period 
if we determine that adjustments to these amounts are required during the remainder of the measurement period such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
for the warranty costs subsequent to the acquisition date  we accrue for startrak s one year warranty coverage on product sales estimated at the time of sale based on historical costs to repair or replace products for customers compared to historical product revenues of startrak 
as we continue to gather additional information these accrual estimates may differ from actual results and adjustments to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
loss contingencies we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
share based compensation our share based compensation plans consist of the long term incentives plan the ltip and the stock option plan 
the ltip approved by our stockholders in september  provides for the grants of non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  common stock  restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus  performance units and performance shares to our employees and non employee directors 
the stock option plan  adopted in  provides for the grants of non qualified and incentive stock options to officers  directors  employees and consultants 
we did not we did not grant any stock options in  and we measure and recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payment awards to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award 
table of contents that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  an evaluation is made at the grant date and future periods as to the likelihood of the performance criteria being met 
compensation expense is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the performance condition until the vesting date 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of unrecognized compensation costs for all share based payment arrangements 
we expect that our planned use of share based payment arrangements will continue to be a significant expense for us in future periods 
we have not recognized  and do not expect to recognize in the near future  any significant tax benefit related to employee stock based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards generated in the us the fair value of each time and performance based sar award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the assumptions described below for the periods indicated 
for years ended december  and  the expected volatility was based on an average of our historical volatility over the expected terms of the sar awards and the comparable publicly traded companies historical volatility 
for the year ended december   the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility for comparable publicly traded companies  due to our insufficient trading history 
we use the simplified method to determine the expected terms of sars due to an insufficient history of exercises 
estimated forfeitures were based on voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual forfeitures 
the risk free interest rate was based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of the grant over the expected term of the sar grants 
years ended december  risk free interest rate to to to expected life years and and and estimated volatility to to and expected dividends none none none the grant date fair value of the rsu awards granted in  and are based upon the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant

table of contents impairment charges and insurance recovery satellite network in september  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to write off quick launch satellite after entering into a settlement agreement with ohb in connection with two contracts to build and deploy satellites that were launched in june  along with signing the new ais satellite deployment and license agreement 
the decision to write off quick launch satellite instead of completing it was based on our determination that completion of the construction and launch of this satellite would not be cost effective 
in february  one quick launch satellite experienced a power system anomaly that subsequently resulted in a loss of contact with the satellite 
the satellite was not recovered and we recorded a non cash impairment charge to write off the cost of the satellite of million during the nine months ended september  in july  one quick launch satellite with lower than expected subscriber transmission experienced a gateway transmitter anomaly that resulted in a loss of contact with the satellite by our ground control systems

table of contents next generation procurement agreements on may   we entered into a procurement agreement with sierra nevada corporation snc pursuant to which snc is constructing eighteen low earth orbit satellites in three sets of satellites shipsets for our next generation satellites the initial satellites 
under the agreement  snc is also providing launch support services  a test satellite excluding the mechanical structure  a satellite software simulator and the associated ground support equipment 
the total contract price for the initial satellites under the procurement agreement is million  subject to reduction upon failure to achieve certain in orbit operational milestones with respect to the initial satellites or if the pre ship reviews of each shipset are delayed more than days after the specified time periods described below 
we have agreed to pay snc up to million in incentive payments for the successful operation of the initial satellites five years following the successful completion of in orbit testing for the third shipset of eight satellites 
on august   we entered into two additional task order agreements with snc in connection with the procurement agreement discussed above 
under the terms of the launch vehicle changes task order agreement  snc will perform the activities to launch eighteen of our next generation satellites on a spacex falcon e or falcon launch vehicle 
the total price for the launch activities is cost reimbursable up to million that is cancelable by us  less a credit of million 
any unused credit can be applied to other activities under the task order agreement  or the original procurement agreement if application to the task order agreement becomes impossible or impracticable 
under the terms of the engineering change requests and enhancements task order agreement  snc will design and make changes to each of the next generation satellites in order to accommodate an additional payload to bus interface 
the total price for the engineering changes requests is cost reimbursable up to million 
both task order agreements are payable monthly as the services are performed  provided that with respect to the launch vehicle changes task order agreement  the credit in the amount of million will first be deducted against amounts accrued thereunder until the entire balance is expended
