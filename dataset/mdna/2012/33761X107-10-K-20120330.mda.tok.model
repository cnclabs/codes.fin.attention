the company has strategically aligned its operations into two major business segments portfolio asset acquisition and resolution and special situations platform 
the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business has been the company s core business segment since it commenced operations in in the portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business  the company acquires portfolios of under performing and non performing loans  and to a lesser extent  performing loans and other assets collectively  portfolio assets or portfolios  generally at a discount to their legal principal balances or appraised values  and services and resolves ie liquidates such portfolio assets in an effort to maximize the present value of the ultimate cash recoveries 
firstcity acquires the portfolio assets for its own account or through investment entities formed with co investors each such entity  an acquisition partnership 
through its special situations platform business  the company provides investment capital to privately held middle market companies through flexible capital structuring arrangements to generate an attractive risk adjusted return 
these capital investments primarily take the form of senior and junior financing arrangements  but also include direct equity investments and common equity warrants 
the company also engages in other investment activities  including leveraged buyouts and distressed debt transactions  through its special situations platform business 
our revenues consist primarily of income from our portfolio assets  loan investments and acquisition partnerships  servicing fee income and incentive income based on the performance of the portfolio assets that we manage  and income generated by our debt and equity investments consolidated and unconsolidated in privately held middle market companies

special situations platform 
the company s earnings related to its special situations platform business segment decreased to million in from million in the decrease in earnings in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries attributed primarily to one time significant revenues in reported by an equity method investee that manufactures prefabricated buildings  and million of income from discontinued operations in compared to in see below  off set partially by a million decrease in net impairment provisions and a million decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests

in addition to its portfolio asset acquisitions in  firstcity invested million in non portfolio asset investments  consisting of million in the form of sba loan originations and advances  million of equity investments us  european and south american acquisition partnerships  million in the form of debt investments and a railroad business acquisition under its special situations platform  and million in the form of investment security purchases

table of contents at december   the carrying value of firstcity s earning assets primarily portfolio assets  equity investments  loans receivable  and entity level earning assets approximated million compared to million a year ago 
the global distribution of firstcity s earning assets at carrying value at december  included million in the united states  million in europe  and million in latin america 
since mid  the vast majority of our portfolio asset investments have been acquired through minority owned  unconsolidated us acquisition partnerships instead of majority owned  consolidated portfolio asset investments under terms of an investment agreement with v rde 
as such  total footings of our consolidated earning assets experienced a corresponding decrease in  resulting primarily from a million decline in our holdings of consolidated portfolio assets during the year 
refer to the headings portfolio asset acquisitions portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business segment and middle market company capital investments special situations platform business segment below for additional information related to our investment activities and composition 
management s outlook our revenues consist primarily of income from our portfolio assets  loan investments and acquisition partnerships  servicing fee income and incentive income based on the performance of the portfolio assets that we manage  and income generated by our debt and equity investments consolidated and unconsolidated in privately held middle market companies 
our ability to maintain and grow revenues depends on our ability to secure investment opportunities  obtain financing for transactions  and to consummate investments and deliver attractive risk adjusted returns 
our ability to execute this strategy depends upon a number of market conditions including the strength and liquidity of us and global economies and financial markets 
while we are seeing signs of improvement and stabilization in us and global economic conditions and financial markets  these conditions and markets remain challenging and their recovery has been imbalanced 
more recently  us debt ceiling and fiscal policy concerns  together with signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe  have increased volatility and uncertainty that could adversely affect the us and global financial markets and economic conditions 
despite substantial losses reported in the financial services sector in recent years  and continued volatility and uncertainty in us and global economies and financial markets  management remains positive on the outlook of the company and believes that current market conditions should not hinder firstcity s ability to expand its business 
while disruptions and uncertainty in the markets may adversely affect our existing positions  we believe such conditions generally present significant new investment opportunities for distressed asset acquisition and special situations transactions 
deteriorating economic conditions in recent years have augmented the trend of financial institutions  government agencies and other sellers to package and sell asset portfolios to investors generally at a discount as a means of disposing of under performing and non performing loans or other surplus or non strategic assets 
financial institutions are also selling under performing and non performing assets to improve their regulatory capital positions pursuant to local and federal regulations  commercial banks and insurance companies are generally required to allocate more regulatory capital to under performing and non performing assets 
sales of such assets improve the seller s balance sheet ie asset quality and capital positions  reduce overhead costs  reduce staffing requirements  and avoid management and personnel distractions associated with the intensive and time consuming task of resolving loans and disposing of real estate 
more recently  us financial institutions and other creditors face challenges in the near term as significant levels of commercial real estate debt mature over the next several years estimated to exceed trillion by some market analysts 
the mounting pressures for financial institutions to refinance this debt will likely be exacerbated by stricter capital requirements imposed by their regulators  and the impact from the 
table of contents withdrawal and termination of previously enacted government stimulus and other economic intervention programs 
in addition  in recent months  investors have been positioning for european distressed asset investments in reaction to signs of deteriorating sovereign debt conditions in europe as market analysts expect european banks to shed their holdings in under performing and non performing assets to enhance their capital reserves 
we believe that as a result of the difficulty in servicing and resolving under performing and non performing assets  and the desire of financial institutions  government entities and other entities to shed these assets for reasons described above  the supply of distressed assets available for sale in the marketplace will continue to rise over the coming years 
market commentators and analysts have expressed the belief that it will take some time for the us and global economies and financial markets to fully recover  but it is not clear if adverse conditions will again intensify 
as a result  the continued challenging economic conditions could still materially and adversely impact i our ability to price and fund new distressed asset and middle market capital investment opportunities on attractive terms  ii the ability of our borrowers to repay or refinance their debt obligations to us  iii the value of the underlying real estate properties and other assets securing our purchased and originated loan investments  and or iv the financial condition  operations and liquidity of the underlying servicing and operating entities in which we have an equity investment 
there can be no assurance that the value of our portfolio assets  loan investments and other investment assets  or the performance of our equity method investees and consolidated subsidiaries  will not be negatively impacted by challenging economic conditions which could have a negative impact on our future results 
in addition to various other debt and equity investment opportunities  we continue to seek distressed asset investment opportunities under our investment agreement with v rde see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company s involvement in these investments will come in the form of minority ownership ranging from to at firstcity s determination of an acquisition entity formed by firstcity and v rde 
firstcity will also be the servicer for the acquisition entities formed with v rde 
firstcity s increased holdings in minority owned  unconsolidated acquisition entities under this investment agreement since mid represent a shift in the company s portfolio asset acquisition history which primarily consisted of consolidated portfolio assets prior to such time 
as such  in the context of the company s portfolio asset acquisition and resolution business segment  management expects to see a gradual shift in the composition of firstcity s income attributed to distressed asset investments to equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries unconsolidated equity method investments from income from portfolio assets consolidated portfolio assets 
management also expects to see a gradual increase in service fee income over time related to the performance of our servicing responsibilities related to these unconsolidated acquisition entities 
refer to the heading results of operations below for additional information related to our portfolio asset acquisition and resolution operations 
our ability to make new investments and fund operations is dependent on anticipated cash flows from unencumbered portfolio assets and equity investments  our current holdings of unencumbered cash  residual cash flows from the pledged assets and equity investments after full repayment of our term loan facilities with bank of scotland and bank of america see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information  cash leak through provisions included in our term loan facilities with bank of scotland and bank of america  and our investment agreement in place with v rde see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for additional information 
while management believes that these cash flow sources will provide firstcity with funding and liquidity to support its operations and investment activities  firstcity continues to actively seek additional sources of liquidity and alternative funding sources 
we remain cognizant about the uncertainty and volatility in us financial markets that currently present challenges for businesses in accessing liquidity and capital  and the resulting impact on our liquidity considerations and operations 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion and analysis are based on the segment reporting information presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
as a result of significant period to period fluctuations in our revenues and earnings  period to period comparisons of the results of our operations may not be meaningful 
the company s financial results are impacted by many factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  fluctuations in the underlying values of real estate and other assets  the timing and ability to collect and liquidate assets  increased competition from other market players in the industries in which we operate  and the availability  pricing and terms for portfolio assets  middle market transactions and other investments in all of the company s businesses 
the company s business and results of operations are also impacted by the availability of liquidity to fund our investment activity and operations  and our access to capital markets 
such factors  individually or combined with other factors  may result in significant fluctuations in our reported operations and in the trading price of our common stock

generally speaking  income recognized from our investments in consolidated portfolio assets is reported as income from portfolio assets on our consolidated statements of earnings  whereas income from our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries that acquire portfolio assets is reported as equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries 
furthermore  since we function as the servicer for the vast majority of our us and latin american unconsolidated portfolio assets  we also recognize fee income related to the performance of our servicing responsibilities 
this fee income is reported as servicing fees on our consolidated statements of earnings 
we also generate service fee income from our us and latin american consolidated portfolio assets that we service  however  this income is eliminated in consolidation and  as such  is not included on our consolidated statements of earnings

servicing fee revenues increased to million in from million in servicing fees from us acquisition partnerships totaled million in compared to million in  while servicing fees from latin american acquisition partnerships totaled million in and million in servicing fees from us acquisition partnerships are generally based on a percentage of the collections received from portfolio assets held by these unconsolidated partnerships  whereas servicing fees from latin american acquisition partnerships are generally based on the cost of servicing plus a profit margin 
the increase in servicing fees from us acquisition partnerships was due primarily to the impact of an increase in collections from unconsolidated us partnerships to million for from million for the decline in servicing fees from the latin american acquisition partnerships was attributable to a lower effective profit margin related to those unconsolidated partnerships in compared to the company also recognized million of additional service fee income in compared to from its sba loan servicing platform 
since mid  a majority of the company s us portfolio asset investments have been acquired through equity method investments in unconsolidated acquisition partnerships under the v rde investment agreement see note of the company s consolidated financial statements instead of consolidated portfolio assets

collections from our consolidated us portfolio assets decreased to million in from million in  due mainly to a decline in our consolidated us portfolio asset holdings since see discussion below 
liquidation income and gains from our consolidated european portfolio assets increased to million in from million in  due mainly to a million increase in collections from these portfolio assets in compared to the company was able to recognize significantly higher margins on its consolidated european portfolio asset liquidations in compared to  which explains the disparate relationship between the significant increase in consolidated collections and the moderate increase in liquidation income and gains in compared to from our consolidated european portfolio assets

the decline in our consolidated us portfolio asset holdings in was due to the majority of our us portfolio asset purchases since mid being made through equity method investments in unconsolidated us acquisition partnerships under the v rde investment agreement 
the decline in our consolidated european portfolio asset holdings in was due primarily to the sale of portfolio assets held by our german acquisition partnerships in february see note of the company s consolidated financial statements

refer to the heading equity income loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries below for information on our unconsolidated us acquisition partnership activities 
gain on sale of sba loans held for sale  net 
the company recorded million of gains on the sales of sba loans in with a million net basis in the loans sold  compared to million of gains recorded in with a million net basis in the loans sold 
gains on sba loan sales reflect the company s participation in the sba guaranteed loan program 
under the sba a program  the sba guarantees up to percent of the principal on a qualifying loan 
the company generally sells the guaranteed portions of originated loans into the secondary market and retains the unguaranteed portion for investment 
the company s recognition of sba loan sales increased in compared to as a result of the company s required adoption of certain accounting guidance in related to transfers of financial assets  combined with a change in the sba loan sales agreements in that impacted the company s recognition of sba loan sales in light of the aforementioned adopted accounting guidance further explained below 

table of contents effective january   the company adopted accounting guidance that required sba loan transactions subject to the sba s premium recourse provision to be accounted for initially as secured borrowings rather than asset sales 
after the premium recourse provisions lapsed generally days  the transaction was then recorded as a sale and the resulting net gain on the sale was recognized as such  only includes nine months of recognized gains from sba loans that were sold during the year 
however  effective january   the sba removed the recourse provisions contained in its loan sales agreements for the guaranteed portions of sba loans 
as a result  sba loan sales transacted by the company under these revised agreements subsequent to january  were accounted for initially as a sale instead of a secured borrowing  with the corresponding gain recognized at the time of sale 
as such  includes the company s recognition of gains on sba loans that were sold from october through january as the day premium recourse provisions had lapsed in  and for the last eleven months of as these transactions did not include premium recourse provisions 
gain on sale of investment securities 
in  the company recognized a million gain related to the sale of an investment security based on million of sales proceeds  compared to a million gain recognized in related to an investment security sale based on million of sales proceeds 
interest income from sba loans 
interest income from sba loans increased to million in compared to million in firstcity s average investment level in sba loans held for investment approximated million for compared to million for interest income from loans receivable affiliates 
interest income from loans receivable affiliates decreased to million for compared to million for the interest income decline is attributed primarily to a decline in firstcity s average investment level in loans receivable affiliates in its paa r segment to million for compared to million for interest income from loans receivable other 
the company did not recognize interest income from loans receivable other in or because management accounted for these loans under the non accrual method of accounting during the entire periods 
firstcity s average investment in loans receivable other in its paa r segment was million in compared to million in other income 
other income for increased by million in comparison to primarily due to million of additional due diligence and credit administration fee income recognized in compared to as a result of increased portfolio asset investment activity under the company s investment agreement with v rde in further contributing to the increase in other income was million of additional interest income recognized in compared to from the company s investment securities 
costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses approximated million in compared to million in the following is a discussion of the major components of the company s operating costs and expenses in its paa r business segment interest expense and fees on notes payable and other debt obligations decreased to million in from million in due primarily to a decline in firstcity s average debt holdings in the periods compared  off set partially by an increase in firstcity s average cost of borrowings 
firstcity s average outstanding debt in its paa r segment was million for compared to million for the company s average cost of borrowings increased to in from in  due primarily to the higher interest and fees charged on our reducing note facility with bank of scotland closed in june and amended in december compared to the interest rates and fees under the loan facilities we had with bank of scotland last year 
in light of the terms on our amended and restated debt obligations with bank of scotland that resulted from our debt refinancing transactions that closed in december see note of the company s consolidated financial 
table of contents statements  we expect the interest expense related to these debt obligations to significantly decline in the future 
salaries and benefits expense in our paa r segment increased to million in from million in  due primarily to additional compensation recognized in compared to under the company s executive management compensation plans 
the total number of personnel within the paa r segment was and at december  and  respectively 
net provisions for loan and impairment losses on our consolidated portfolio assets and loans receivable in our paa r segment totaled million in compared to million in the million of net impairment provisions in were attributed primarily to declines in values of loan collateral and real estate properties related to our us portfolio asset investments 
the net impairment provisions were identified in connection with management s quarterly evaluation of the collectibility of the company s portfolio assets and loans receivable 
the process for evaluating and measuring impairment is critical to our financial results  as it requires subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are uncertain 
this process also requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
it remains unclear what impact the continuance of challenging economic conditions and disruptions in the financial  capital and real estate markets will ultimately have on our financial results 
these conditions could adversely impact our business if commercial real estate properties experience a significant and prolonged decline in value or if borrowers cannot refinance their loans and or continue to make payments which in turn could lead to rising loan defaults and foreclosures on loan collateral 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that  in any particular future period  we will not incur additional impairment provisions 
asset level expenses  which generally represent costs incurred by firstcity to manage consolidated portfolio assets  support foreclosed properties  and protect its security interests in loan collateral  decreased to million in from million in the decline in asset level expenses was attributed primarily to a decline in the company s average holdings in consolidated portfolio assets in its paa r segment to million for from million for a majority of firstcity s portfolio asset investments have been acquired through unconsolidated acquisition partnerships since mid 
other costs and expenses in the company s paa r segment increased by million in compared to  due primarily to the recognition of a million write down on our net investment in a majority owned mexican acquisition partnership in q this write down to our consolidated subsidiary resulted from a lower of cost or market adjustment upon the subsidiary s classification as held for sale in q due to management s expectation to sell or otherwise dispose of this subsidiary and two other consolidated mexican subsidiaries over the next twelve months see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of the other subsidiaries exceeded their carrying amounts 
approximately million of this write down was attributed to the noncontrolling investor s share included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  as such  the net impact of this write down to firstcity approximated million 
further contributing to the increase in other costs and expenses was a million increase in non income based taxes incurred by our consolidated european operations in compared to due primarily to the incurrence of transfer taxes from asset sales and other activities during  and a million increase in asset valuation costs in compared to due primarily from a rise in portfolio asset investment activity in equity income loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries 
equity losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries acquisition partnership and servicing entities from our paa r segment increased by million in compared to equity losses from our unconsolidated acquisition partnerships totaled million in compared to million in  whereas equity income from our unconsolidated servicing entities increased to million in compared to million in 
table of contents our share of equity income and losses from these equity method investees will vary period to period depending on the profitability of the underlying entities and the composition of firstcity s ownership mix in the respective entities that report earnings or losses in a period 
the following is a discussion of equity income loss from firstcity s acquisition partnerships by geographic region and servicing entities 
refer to note of the company s consolidated financial statements for a summary of revenues  earnings and equity income loss of firstcity s equity method investments by region 
united states total combined revenues reported by our us acquisition partnerships firstcity share increased to million in compared to million in in addition  total combined net earnings reported by our us partnerships increased to million in compared to million in the increase in total revenues and net earnings in compared to was attributable primarily to an increase in portfolio asset collections to million in from million in  off set partially by increases of million in asset level expenses and million in service fee expense in compared to the collective activity described above translated to an increase in firstcity s share of us partnership net earnings to million in compared to a million loss in firstcity s average investment in us acquisition partnerships increased to million for from million for  due primarily to increased investment activity in newly formed us acquisition partnerships under firstcity s investment agreement with v rde 
in light of firstcity s increased holdings in us portfolio assets acquired through equity method investments in unconsolidated acquisition partnerships instead of consolidated portfolio assets over the past year  the company expects equity income from us acquisition partnerships and service fee income to gradually increase over time in comparison to income from consolidated portfolio assets 
latin america total combined revenues reported by our latin american acquisition partnerships firstcity s share remained steady at million in compared to million in however  total combined net losses reported by our latin american partnerships increased to million in compared to million the increase in net losses reported by these partnerships in compared to was attributable primarily to million of additional foreign currency exchange losses recorded in compared to including million of additional foreign currency exchange losses recorded in q compared to the fourth quarter of q 
the significant increase in foreign currency exchange losses recorded by these partnerships in q compared to q stemmed from the translation impact to the us dollar denominated debt held by certain latin american partnerships due to the higher appreciation in value of the us dollar relative to the mexican peso in q compared to q 
further contributing to the increase in combined net losses reported by these partnerships was million of additional net impairment provisions recorded in compared to the collective activity described above translated to an increase in firstcity s share of latin american partnership net losses to million in from million in in q  the company recognized a million impairment charge on certain latin american mexico acquisition partnerships to write down the investments to fair value  primarily due to the fair value being significantly lower than the cost basis of these investments and management s belief that the fair value of these investments will not recover as evidenced by low transaction volumes in the distressed asset market in mexico 
this impairment charge was included in equity income loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries in our consolidated statements of earnings 
based on this investor level impairment charge  combined with firstcity s share of latin american partnership net losses described above  firstcity recognized a combined equity loss of million attributed to its latin american acquisition partnerships in 
table of contents firstcity s average investment in latin american acquisition partnerships was million for compared to million for europe at december   the company did not carry any equity method investments in european acquisition partnerships  and had nominal investments at december  this decrease in firstcity s equity method investments in european acquisition partnerships was attributed primarily to the company s step acquisition transaction and resulting consolidation of a german partnership entity in the second quarter of see note of the company s consolidated financial statements  the company s sale of its minority equity interest in a french partnership entity in the first quarter of  and the company s step acquisition transaction and resulting consolidation of eight german partnership entities in december see note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  during the respective periods that we carried equity method investments in european acquisition partnerships  total combined revenues reported by these partnerships decreased to million in from million in  and these partnerships reported nominal income in compared to million of losses in firstcity s share of european acquisition partnership income was nominal in  compared to the company s share of million in losses from these partnerships in in february  the company sold a substantial majority of its interests in the portfolio assets held by the eight consolidated german partnership entities described above along with its wholly owned equity interest in another german partnership entity to a european securitization entity formed by an affiliate of v rde 
firstcity has a beneficial interest in this securitization entity  and accounts for this investment as an available for sale investment security 
servicing entities total combined revenues mainly service fee income and investment income reported by our foreign unconsolidated servicing entities firstcity s share increased to million in from million in  and total combined net earnings reported by these entities improved to million in from million in the increase in total net earnings reported by the underlying servicing entities was attributed primarily to additional investment income including gains from investment security transactions and service fee income due to increased collections reported by these entities in compared to  off set partially by a million increase in tax expense reported by these entities in compared to the collective activity described above translated to an increase in firstcity s share of net earnings from its foreign servicing entities to million in earnings for from million in earnings for gain on business combinations 
in  the company recognized a million business combination gain attributable to a step acquisition transaction in which the company acquired a controlling interest in a european acquisition partnership from a foreign equity method investee 
the company owned a noncontrolling equity interest in this entity prior to the transaction 
under business combination accounting guidance  the company s previously held noncontrolling interest in the entity was re measured to fair value on the acquisition date which resulted in the company s recognition of the gain 
in  the company recognized million of business combination gains including million in q attributable to step acquisition transactions in which the company acquired controlling interests in three us acquisition partnerships march and eight european acquisition partnerships december 
the company owned noncontrolling equity interests in these entities prior to the transactions

table of contents gain on debt extinguishment 
in december  firstcity refinanced its senior credit facility with bank of scotland  which had an unpaid principal balance of approximately million at closing 
as a result  firstcity s primary obligation under this loan facility  as amended bos facility a  was reduced by the assumption of million of debt bos facility b by a newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary of firstcity  combined with a million reduction from proceeds obtained by firstcity from its new million credit facility with bank of america and other cash payments at closing 
firstcity s remaining million debt obligation under bos facility a post closing carries a annual interest rate through maturity december  and allows for repayment over time as cash flows from the underlying pledged assets are realized 
firstcity s million debt obligation under bos facility b does not bear interest  and allows for repayment over time as cash flows from the underlying pledged assets  if any  are realized firstcity has not received any significant cash flows from these underlying assets and has not allocated any value to these assets for the past two years 
as a result of this debt refinancing arrangements  firstcity was able to significantly reduce its aggregate future cash outlay to bank of scotland and bank of america under these new loan facilities in comparison to the repayment terms under its former senior credit facility with bank of scotland 
firstcity accounted for this debt refinancing transaction with bank of scotland as a debt extinguishment under fasb s debt modifications and extinguishment guidance  and recognized a million debt extinguishment gain in q  as firstcity effectively reduced the carrying amount of debt on its balance sheet

firstcity denver management regularly evaluates the collectibilty and recoverability of its investments 
the process for evaluating and measuring impairment is critical to our financial results  as it requires subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are uncertain 
this process also requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
it remains unclear what impact the continuation of challenging economic conditions and disruptions in the financial  capital and real estate markets will ultimately have on our financial results 
these conditions could adversely impact our business if borrowers cannot continue to make payments on their loans  or if the values of our underlying loan collateral and real 
table of contents estate properties continue to decline 
therefore  we cannot provide assurance that  in any particular future period  we will not incur additional impairment provisions

we remain cognizant about the uncertainty and volatility in us financial markets that currently present challenges for businesses in accessing liquidity and capital  and the resulting impact on our liquidity considerations and operations 
bank of scotland and bank of america loan facilities in june  firstcity combined and refinanced its acquisition loan facilities with bank of scotland and closed on a million reducing note facility agreement reducing note facility that provides for repayment to bank of scotland over time as cash flows from the underlying assets securing the loan facility are realized 
the company s outstanding indebtedness and letter of credit obligations under its then existing loan facilities with bank of scotland were refinanced into the reducing note facility 
this term loan facility capped firstcity s financing arrangements with bank of scotland  and as such  bank of scotland had no further obligation to provide financing to fund firstcity s investment activities and operations after june refer to the heading credit facilities below for the primary terms of this term loan facility 
a substantial majority of firstcity s us and international portfolio asset investments and related equity investments transacted prior to july  for its own account and through acquisition partnerships  were funded by senior secured acquisition loan facilities that were provided by bank of scotland 
these loan facilities provided by bank of scotland were combined and refinanced in june into a single term loan facility reducing note facility 
the reducing note facility capped firstcity s financing arrangements with bank of scotland  and as such  bank of scotland had no further obligation to provide financing to fund firstcity s portfolio asset investments after june in december  firstcity refinanced the reducing note facility with bank of scotland 
as a result  firstcity s debt obligation under the reducing note facility was divided into two separate term loan facilities with bank of scotland  and the company concurrently closed on a new million term loan facility with bank of america net proceeds from this term loan were applied against the reducing note facility at closing 
the assets and related cash flows that had served as collateral under the reducing note facility with bank of scotland  were allocated and respectively pledged as collateral among the company s new term loan facilities with bank of scotland and bank of america ie firstcity did not pledge additional assets as security interests in these new loan facilities 
given the nature of the term loan facilities  bank of scotland and bank of america have no obligation to provide firstcity with financing to fund new portfolio assets investments under terms of their respective credit facilities that resulted from the december debt refinancing arrangement 
however  firstcity was able to significantly reduce its aggregate future cash outlay to bank of scotland and bank of america under these new loan facilities in comparison to the repayment terms under the former reducing note facility with bank of scotland which  in turn  will provide more liquidity to fund future investment opportunities

debt refinancing bank of scotland on december   fc commercial  as borrower  and flbg corp  as guarantor  and bank of scotland  acting through its new york branch as agent  collateral agent and lender  entered into an amended and restated reducing note facility agreement the amended restated bos agreement that amended and restated the reducing note facility agreement that these parties had executed previously on june   along with fh partners  as borrower  and bos usa inc bos usa  as lender  at that time 
the reducing note facility had an unpaid principal balance of approximately million prior to closing 
fc commercial s obligation under the amended restated bos agreement defined as bos facility a and described below  was reduced by the assumption of million of debt defined as bos facility b and described below by flbg holdings llc flbg  a newly formed subsidiary of firstcity  combined with a million reduction from net proceeds obtained under a new credit facility between fh partners  as borrower  and bank of america  na bank of america  as lender defined as boa loan and described below  and million of reductions at closing primarily from cash payments made by other firstcity subsidiaries 
subsequent to closing  fc commercial s remaining debt obligation under bos facility a was million 
firstcity accounted for this debt refinancing transaction with bank of scotland as a debt extinguishment under fasb s debt modifications and extinguishment guidance  because the present value of the cash flows under the amended and new debt instruments bos facility a and bos facility b  respectively was at least different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the original debt instrument reducing note facility 
pursuant to debt extinguishment accounting  the amended and new debt instruments should initially be recorded at fair value  and that amount plus fees paid to or on behalf of the lender should be compared to the net carrying amount of the de recognized original debt to determine the debt extinguishment gain or loss to be recognized 
as a result  firstcity recognized a million debt extinguishment gain from this debt refinancing transaction  which was computed as the difference between the million net carrying amount of the original debt inclusive of the million of cash payments at closing and million of unamortized loan fees  and the million estimated fair value of the amended and new debt instruments plus million of third party fees paid on behalf of bank of scotland at closing 

table of contents since the company s credit facilities with bank of scotland are non public debt instruments  quoted prices in an active market for identical liabilities and quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities when traded by other parties as assets were not readily available

discussion of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment 
management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors  including the current economic environment 
we adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate 
the continuance of challenging economic conditions and disruptions in the financial  capital  real estate and foreign currency markets  have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial position and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
loan portfolio assets revenue and impairment recognition a substantial majority of the company s portfolio assets include acquired loans and loan portfolios with evidence of credit deterioration since origination purchased credit impaired loans at fair value on the acquisition date 
the amounts paid for purchased credit impaired loans reflect the company s determination that the loans have experienced deterioration in credit quality since origination and that it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the underlying loans 
at acquisition  the company reviews each individual loan to determine whether there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and if it is 
table of contents probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
if both conditions exist  the company determines whether each such loan is to be accounted for individually or whether such loans will be assembled into static pools based on common risk characteristics primarily loan type and collateral 
static pools of individual loan accounts may be established and accounted for as a single economic unit for the recognition of income  principal payments and loss provision 
once a static loan pool is established  individual accounts are generally not added to or removed from the pool unless the company sells  forecloses or writes off the loan 
at acquisition  the company determines the excess of the scheduled contractual payments over all cash flows expected to be collected for the loan or loan pool as an amount that should not be accreted nonaccretable difference 
the excess of the cash flows from the loan or loan pool expected to be collected at acquisition over the initial investment accretable difference is recognized as interest income over the remaining life of the loan or loan pool on a level yield basis accretable yield 
the discount ie the difference between the cost of each loan or loan pool and the related aggregate contractual receivable balance is not recorded because the company does not expect to fully collect each contractual receivable balance 
as a result  these loans and loan pools are recorded at cost which approximates fair value at the time of acquisition 
the company accounts for purchased credit impaired loans using either the interest method or a non accrual method through application of the cost recovery or cash basis method of accounting 
application of the interest method is dependent on management s ability to develop a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
in the event the company cannot develop or establish a reasonable expectation as to both the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected  the company uses the cost recovery or cash basis method of accounting 
interest method of accounting 
under the interest method  an effective interest rate  or irr  is applied to the cost basis of the loan or loan pool 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over expected cash flows cannot be recognized as an adjustment of income or expense or on the balance sheet 
the irr that is calculated when the loan is purchased remains constant as the basis for subsequent impairment testing performed at least quarterly and income recognition 
significant increases in actual  or expected future cash flows  are used first to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or loan pool  and any remaining increase may be recognized prospectively through an upward adjustment of the irr over the remaining life of the loan or loan pool 
any increase to the irr then becomes the new benchmark for impairment testing and income recognition 
subsequent decreases in projected cash flows do not change the irr  but are recognized as an impairment of the cost basis of the loan or loan pool to maintain the then current irr  and are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
firstcity establishes valuation allowances for loans and loan pools acquired with credit deterioration to reflect only those losses incurred after acquisition that is  the cash flows expected at acquisition that are no longer expected to be collected 
income from loans and loan pools accounted for under the interest method is accrued based on the irr of each loan or loan pool applied to their respective adjusted cost basis 
gross collections in excess of the interest accrual and impairments will reduce the carrying value of the loan or loan pool  while gross collections less than the interest accrual will increase the carrying value 
the irr is calculated based on the timing and amount of anticipated cash flows using the company s proprietary collection models 
cost recovery method of accounting 
if the amount and timing of future cash collections on a loan are not reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such asset on the cost recovery method 
under the cost recovery method  no income is recognized until the company has fully collected the cost of the loan  or until such time as the company considers the timing and amount of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
at least quarterly  the company performs an evaluation to determine if the remaining amount that is 
table of contents probable of collection is less than the carrying value of the loan or loan pool  and if so  recognizes impairment through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash basis method of accounting 
if only the amount of future cash collections on a loan is reasonably estimable  the company accounts for such asset on an individual loan basis under the cash basis method of accounting 
under the cash basis method  no income is recognized unless collections are received during the period  or until such time as the company considers the timing of collections to be reasonably estimable and begins to recognize income based on the interest method as described above 
income is recognized for the difference between the collections and a pro rata portion of cost on a loan 
cost allocation is based on a proration of actual collections divided by total projected collections on the loan 
significant increases in future cash flows may be recognized prospectively as income over the remaining life of the loan through increased amounts allocated to income when collections are subsequently received 
subsequent decreases in projected cash flows are recognized as impairment of the loan s cost basis to maintain a constant cost allocation based on initial projections 
the company evaluates the projected cash flows for these loans and loan pools at least quarterly to determine if impairment exists  and if so  recognizes the impairment through provisions charged to operations  with a corresponding valuation allowance offsetting the loan or loan pool in the consolidated balance sheets 
management uses the cash basis method of accounting for such eligible loans primarily due to the increased uncertainty in the timing of future collections attributable primarily to the borrowers inability to obtain financing to refinance the loans 
real estate portfolio assets valuation and impairment recognition real estate portfolio assets consist of real estate properties purchased from a variety of sellers or acquired through loan foreclosure 
rental income  net of expenses  is generally recognized when received 
the company accounts for its real estate properties on an individual asset basis as opposed to a pool basis 
real estate held for sale primarily includes real estate acquired through loan foreclosure 
the company classifies a property as held for sale if management commits to a plan to sell the property  the company actively markets the property in its current condition for a price that is reasonable in comparison to its fair value  and management considers the sale of such property within one year of the balance sheet date to be probable 
real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are initially recorded at the lower of cost ie the underlying loan s carrying value or estimated fair value less disposition costs at the date of foreclosure establishing a new cost basis 
the amount  if any  by which the carrying value of the underlying loan exceeds the property s fair value less estimated disposition costs at the foreclosure date is charged as a loss against operations 
expenditures for repairs  maintenance  and other holding costs are charged to operations as incurred 
real estate properties acquired through loan foreclosure are classified as held for sale  and carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated disposition costs 
real estate is not depreciated while it is classified as held for sale 
impairment losses are recorded if a property s fair value less estimated disposition costs is less than its carrying amount  and charged to operations in the period the impairment is identified 
real estate held for investment generally includes acquired properties and is carried at cost less depreciation and amortization  as applicable 
the company classifies a property as held for investment if the property is still under development and or management does not expect the property to be sold within one year of the balance sheet date 
real estate properties acquired through a purchase transaction are initially recorded at the cost of the acquisition 
the cost of acquired property includes the purchase price of the property  legal fees  and certain other acquisition costs 
subsequent to acquisition  the company capitalizes capital improvements and expenditures related to significant betterments and replacements  including costs related to the development and improvement of the 
table of contents property for its intended use 
expenditures for repairs  maintenance  and other holding costs are charged to operations as incurred 
the company periodically reviews its property held for investment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property held for investment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the property 
if the property is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by discounted cash flows or market comparisons 
loans receivable valuation and impairment recognition sba loans held for sale the portions of us small business administration sba loans that are guaranteed by the sba are classified by management as loans held for sale 
these loans are recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value 
the fair value of sba loans held for sale is based primarily on prices that secondary markets are currently offering for loans with similar characteristics 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance through a charge to income 
the carrying value of sba loans held for sale is net of premiums as well as deferred origination fees and costs 
premiums and net origination fees and costs are deferred and included in the basis of the loans in calculating gains and losses upon sale 
sba loans are generally secured by the borrowing entities assets such as accounts receivable  property and equipment  and other business assets 
the company generally sells the guaranteed portion of each loan to a third party investor and retains the servicing rights 
the non guaranteed portion of sba loans is classified as held for investment discussed below 
effective january   the company adopted accounting guidance that required sba loan transactions subject to the sba s premium recourse provision to be accounted for initially as secured borrowings rather than asset sales 
after the premium recourse provisions had elapsed  the transaction was recorded as a sale and the resulting net gain on sale was recognized which was based on the difference between the proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the loan sold 
however  effective january   the sba removed the recourse provisions contained in its loan sales agreements for guaranteed portions of sba loans 
as a result  sba loan sales transacted by the company under these revised agreements were accounted for initially as a sale  with the corresponding gain recognized at the time of sale 
the gains recognized on these loan sales were based on the difference between the sales proceeds received and the allocated carrying value of the loans sold which included deferred premiums and net origination fees and costs 
loans held for investment loans receivable consisting of loans made to affiliated entities including acquisition partnerships and other equity method investees and non affiliated entities  and the non guaranteed portions of sba loans  are classified by management as held for investment 
these loans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income  charge offs  unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans  and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans 
loan origination fees and costs  as well as purchase premiums and discounts  are amortized as level yield adjustments over the respective loan terms 
unamortized net fees  costs  premiums or discounts are recognized upon early repayment or sale of the loan 
repayment of the loans is generally dependent upon future cash flows of the borrowers  future cash flows of the underlying collateral  and distributions made from affiliated entities 
interest is accrued when earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the loans  except for loans on non accrual status 
interest is recognized on an accrual basis at the applicable interest rate on the principal amount outstanding 
the company has established an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable  estimable losses inherent in its portfolio of loans receivable held for investment 
this allowance for loan losses includes 
table of contents specific allowances  based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships  and allowances for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is a quarterly process and is based on evaluating the collectibility of the loans in light of various factors  as applicable  such as quality and composition of the loan portfolio segments  estimated future cash receipts of the borrower s operations or underlying collateral  historical experience  estimated value of underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions  industry concentrations and conditions  and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
actual losses experienced in the future may vary from management s estimates 
management attributes portions of the allowance to loans that it evaluates and determines to be impaired and to groups of loans that it evaluates collectively 
in determining the appropriate level of allowance  management uses information to stratify its portfolio of loans receivable held for investment into loan pools with common risk characteristics 
classes in the affiliated and non affiliated portfolio asset and commercial loan portfolio segments are generally disaggregated by accrual status which is generally based on management s assessment on the probability of default 
classes in the non guaranteed sba commercial loan portfolio segment are disaggregated based upon underlying credit quality 
certain portions of the allowance are attributed to loan pools based on various factors and analyses  including but not limited to  current and historical loss experience trends  collateral  region  current economic conditions  and industry concentrations and conditions 
loans deemed to be impaired  including loans with an increased probability of default as determined by management  are evaluated individually rather than on a pool basis as described above 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms including scheduled interest payments 
when management identifies a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment based on discounted future cash flows  except when foreclosure is probable or the source of repayment is the operation or liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  we cease to accrue interest on the note and interest previously accrued but not collected becomes part of our recorded investment in the loan and is collectively reviewed for impairment 
when ultimate collectibility of the impaired note is in doubt  all collections are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered  and collections thereafter are recognized as interest income 
we return a loan to accrual status when we determine that the collectibility of principal and interest is reasonably assured 
impairment losses are charged against an allowance account through provisions charged to operations in the period impairment is identified 
loans are written off against the allowance when all possible means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
deferred tax assets valuation the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities in both the us and us jurisdictions based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates  if any  would be recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets through a valuation allowance if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
accordingly  the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically by the company based on the more likely than not realization threshold criterion 
in this assessment  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax 
table of contents assets 
this assessment considers  among other factors  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  excess of appreciated asset value over the tax basis of net assets  impact of gains or charges from one time events  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  the company s experience with utilizing available operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and tax planning strategies 
in making such assessments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws between our projected operating performance  our actual results and other factors 
for purposes of evaluating the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
at december  and  the company established a full valuation allowance for its us deferred tax assets due to the lack of sufficient objective evidence regarding the realization of these assets in the foreseeable future 
regardless of the deferred tax valuation allowance established at december   the company continues to retain net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  through the year to the extent that the company generates taxable income in the future to utilize the tax benefits of the related deferred tax assets  subject to certain potential limitations  it may be able to reduce its effective tax rate by reducing the valuation allowance 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results  including further market deterioration  may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates could have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
estimates of cash flows from portfolio assets the company uses estimates to determine future cash flows from portfolio assets 
these estimates of future cash flows from portfolio assets are utilized in four primary ways i to calculate the allocation of cost of certain under performing and non performing portfolios assets  ii to determine the effective yield of performing portfolios assets  iii to determine the reasonableness of settlement offers received in the liquidation of the portfolio assets  and iv to determine whether or not there is impairment in our portfolio assets 
the company uses proprietary programs and collection models to manage the portfolio assets that it owns and services 
each asset within a pool is analyzed by an account manager who is responsible for analyzing the asset s underlying characteristics 
the account manager projects future cash receipts and expenses related to each asset  the sum of which provides the total estimated future net cash receipts related to a particular asset or loan pool 
these estimates are routinely monitored by the company to determine reasonableness of the cash flow estimates 
consolidation policy the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of firstcity  its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries  and certain variable interest entities where we are the primary 
table of contents beneficiary as prescribed by the financial accounting standards board s the fasb accounting guidance on variable interest entities 
consolidated subsidiaries if we determine that we have a controlling financial interest in an entity  then we must consolidate the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the entity in our consolidated financial statements 
a controlling financial interest typically arises as a result of ownership of a majority of the voting interests of an entity 
however  we may also have a controlling financial interest in an entity through an arrangement that does not involve voting interests  such as a variable interest entity vie 
in general  a vie is an entity that has one or more of the following characteristics the entity has total equity at risk that is not sufficient to finance its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support from other entities  the group of equity owners does not have the ability to make significant decisions about the entity s activities  the group of equity owners does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns generated by its operations  or both  or the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity  or both  and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
if any of these characteristics is present  the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation analysis  and consolidation is based on variable interests  and not solely on ownership of the entity s outstanding voting stock 
variable interests are generally defined as contractual  ownership or other economic interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
if certain characteristics are present in these transactions  the entity is subject to a variable interests consolidation analysis  and consolidation is based on variable interests  and not solely on ownership of the entity s outstanding voting stock 
in making the determination as to whether an entity is considered to be a vie  we first perform a qualitative analysis  which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessments  including  but not limited to  the design of the entity  the variability that the entity was designed to create and pass along to its interest holders  the rights of the parties  and the purpose of the arrangement 
if we cannot conclude after a qualitative analysis whether an entity is a vie  we perform a quantitative analysis 
if an entity is determined to be a vie  we determine if our variable interest causes us to be considered the primary beneficiary 
we are the primary beneficiary and are required to consolidate the entity if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and we have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns that could be significant to the entity 
the assessment of the party that has the power to direct the activities of the vie may require significant management judgment when more than one party has power  or more than one party is involved in the design of the vie but no party has the power to direct the ongoing activities that could be significant 
we are required to continually assess whether we are the primary beneficiary and  therefore  may consolidate a vie through the duration of our involvement 
examples of certain events that may change whether or not we consolidate the vie include a change in the design of the entity or a change in our ownership 
generally  if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  then we initially record the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
if we cease to be deemed the primary beneficiary of a consolidated vie  then we deconsolidate the vie 
unconsolidated subsidiaries the company does not consolidate investments in entities that are not vies where the company does not have an effective controlling interest  or investments in entities that are vies where the company is not the primary beneficiary 
rather  such investments  which represent equity investments 
table of contents in non publicly traded entities  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting since the company has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over operating and financial policies of such subsidiaries including certain entities where we have less than ownership 
firstcity has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of its less than owned entities  despite its comparatively smaller ownership percentage  due primarily to its active participation in the policy making process as well as its involvement in the daily management activities of the entities 
under the equity method of accounting  the company s investments in these unconsolidated entities are carried at the cost of acquisition  plus the company s share of equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition 
we eliminate transactions with our equity method subsidiaries to the extent of our ownership in such subsidiaries 
accordingly  our share of the income or losses of these equity method subsidiaries is included in our consolidated net income 
the company follows the accounting guidance for the equity method of accounting to determine if there has been an other than temporary decline in value of its investments in unconsolidated entities 
the company reviews its investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the fair value may be less than the carrying value of its investment 
a loss in value of an investment which is other than temporary is recognized as a component of equity income loss of unconsolidated subsidiaries in the consolidated statements of earnings 
this determination is based on the extent and or length of time to which fair value was less than carrying value  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment  and other relevant factors and circumstances 
when evaluating for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market  we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our unconsolidated investments and or look to comparable activities in the marketplace if available 
management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach 
these assumptions include  among others  net asset values  internal rates of return and discount rates 
fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value for applicable fair value disclosures 
investment securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record at fair value certain other assets and liabilities on a non recurring basis  portfolio assets  loans receivable  real estate investments  servicing assets  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries  and various other assets held for sale including liabilities related to the assets held for sale 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically involve lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
the accounting guidance on fair value measurements establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level measurements 
we group our assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels of the fair value hierarchy  based on the fair value measurement technique  as described below level valuation is based upon quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets and liabilities in active exchange markets that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques with significant assumptions and inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 

table of contents level valuation is derived from model based techniques that use inputs and significant assumptions that are supported by little or no observable market data 
these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include the use of pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
the level of fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is most significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
in the determination of the classification of assets and liabilities in level or level of the fair value hierarchy  we consider all available information  including observable market data  indications of market conditions  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the fair value measurements of the respective assets and liabilities in their entirety 
if the valuation techniques that are most significant to the fair value measurements are principally derived from assumptions and inputs that are corroborated by little or no observable market data  the asset or liability is classified as level we attempt to base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs  when reasonably available  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
however  active market pricing information and other observable market data are not available for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments primarily distressed assets and non public debt instruments 
in instances where there is limited or no observable market data  fair value measurements are based principally upon our own valuation models and estimates  or combination of our own valuation models and estimates plus independent vendor or broker pricing  and the measurements are often calculated  as applicable  based on current pricing adjusted for the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability  and other such factors 
as with any valuation technique used to estimate fair value  changes in underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
accordingly  these fair value estimates may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
the company believes the imprecision of an estimate could significantly impact the fair value measurement 
effects of newly adopted accounting standards finance receivables and allowance for credit losses disclosure in july  the fasb issued accounting guidance related to disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
the objective of the amendment is disclosure of information that enables financial statement users to understand the nature of inherent credit risks  the entity s method of analysis and assessment of credit risk in estimating the allowance for credit losses  and the reasons for changes in both the receivables and allowances when examining a creditor s portfolio of financing receivables and its allowance for losses 
we adopted the period end disclosure requirements of this guidance related to an entity s credit quality of financing receivables and the related allowance for loan losses in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we adopted the activity related provisions of this guidance for the quarterly period ended march  since the activity related provisions of this guidance were disclosure only in nature  the adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents loan modifications and loan pool accounting in april  the fasb issued accounting guidance that clarifies when creditors should classify loan modifications as troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after january  the guidance on measuring the impairment of a receivable restructured in a tdr is effective on a prospective basis 
this guidance supersedes the fasb s previous deferral of additional disclosures about tdrs 
for a loan restructuring to constitute a tdr  a creditor must conclude that the restructuring constitutes a concession and the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
we adopted this guidance on july   as required 
under this clarified guidance  we do not report loans modified in a tdr that had been fully paid down  charged off or foreclosed upon by period end 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
fair value measurements disclosure in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately  a reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
we adopted this guidance for the quarterly period ended march  since this guidance was disclosure only in nature  the adoption of this updated guidance did not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
effect of newly issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income 
this guidance requires entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity was eliminated 
in december  the fasb issued updated guidance that defers indefinitely certain requirements from its june guidance that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
both of these guidance issues are effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december  and for interim periods within the fiscal year  with full retrospective application 
early adoption is permitted 
we believe that the adoption of these guidance issues will not have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value 
this guidance amends the application of the highest and best use concept to be used only in the measurement of fair value of nonfinancial assets  clarifies that the measurement of the fair value of equity classified financial instruments should be performed from the perspective of a market participant who holds the instrument as an asset  clarifies that an entity that manages a group of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of its net risk exposure can measure those financial instruments on the basis of its net exposure to those risks  and clarifies when premiums and discounts should be taken into account when measuring fair value 
this guidance also requires new and enhanced disclosures on the quantification and valuation processes for significant unobservable inputs  transfers between levels and  and the categorization of all fair value measurements into the fair value hierarchy  even where those measurements are only for disclosure purposes 
this amended guidance is effective prospectively from january  we believe that the adoption of this amended guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations
