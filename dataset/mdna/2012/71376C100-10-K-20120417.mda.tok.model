item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management overview during fiscal  the company continued its efforts to improve its retail operations and in store experience to maximize retail revenues  reduce its cost base and minimize discretionary spending  optimize inventory levels and improve inventory turns  working capital and operating cash flows 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to an increase in retail sales offset by a decrease in wholesale sales 
retail sales increased compared to the prior year as a result of increases in sales for both perfumania and sow  driven by increases in prices per unit as well as in customer traffic 
wholesale revenues decreased by from the prior year as a result of less product availability and less customer demand 
total gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our operating expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in operating expenses for fiscal are million of expenses related to the pending merger with parlux 
see further discussion at item of this form k 
including million of interest expense  we realized a net income of approximately million in fiscal  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the periods indicated 
table of contents percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  total net sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment merger related expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  asset impairments  sales returns and allowances  and other contingent assets and liabilities 
as such  some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
the judgments and estimates made can significantly affect results 
materially different amounts might be reported under different conditions or by using different assumptions 
we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accounts receivable  net of allowances in the normal course of business  we extend credit to wholesale customers that satisfy pre determined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  is net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through the analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on an evaluation of historical and anticipated trends  the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
should circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate significantly  we may need to increase our provisions 
inventory adjustments and writeoffs inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and potentially slow moving inventory based on prior sales  forecasted demand and historical experience and through specific identification of obsolete or damaged merchandise and we record adjustments to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in accordance with our assessment 
if actual sales are less than our forecasts  additional writeoffs could be necessary 
inventory shrinkage is estimated and accrued between physical inventory counts 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future undiscounted cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
inherent in this process is significant management judgment as to the projected cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest 
table of contents level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
judgments are also made as to whether under performing stores should be closed 
even if a decision has been made not to close an under performing store  the assets at that store may be impaired 
the company conducted an internal review of its long lived assets primarily leasehold improvements at the store level in fiscal and determined that the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their projected future undiscounted cash flows 
the company then determined the fair value of the identified long lived assets by discounting their projected future cash flows using a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital  which resulted in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company conducted a similar review of its long lived assets at the store level in fiscal and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
in fiscal and  we also recorded impairment charges of approximately million in each year  on a building under a capital lease 
as the projection of future cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates  if actual results are materially different than these judgments or estimates  additional charges could be necessary 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
impairment of intangible assets the company s owned tradenames that have been determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are reviewed at least annually for potential impairment 
the fair values are estimated and compared to their carrying values 
fair value is principally estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
trademarks  including tradenames and owned licenses having finite lives are amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values and are also reviewed for impairment 
the recoverability of the carrying values of all long lived assets with finite lives is re evaluated when changes in circumstances indicate the assets value may be impaired 
there was no recorded goodwill as of january  and january  based on management s impairment review at january  and january   there was no impairment of trademarks or tradenames in fiscal or we will continue to monitor the expected future cash flows of the company s reporting units and the long term market capitalization trends to assess the carrying values of the intangible assets 
sales and allowances revenue from wholesale transactions is recorded when title passes 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and allowances 
revenue from retail sales is recorded  net of discounts  at the point of sale for perfumania stores  and for consignment sales  when sale to the ultimate customer occurs 
revenue from internet sales is recognized at the time products are delivered to customers 
we record an estimate of returns  discounts and allowances  and review and refine these estimates on a regular basis based on current experience and trends 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results  however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
valuation of deferred tax assets accounting guidance requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will not be realized 
the guidance also prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors 
the range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments and it is very difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets is realizable 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected in calculating deferred tax assets could result in significant additional adjustments to our deferred tax assets and income tax expense 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales we recognized net sales of million in fiscal  an increase of from the million recorded in fiscal the breakdown of sales between retail and wholesale was as follows for the year ended in thousands january  percentage of sales january  percentage of sales percentage increase decrease retail wholesale total net sales retail sales increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in perfumania s retail sales of million and an increase in sow s consignment sales of million

we exclude stores that are closed for renovation from comparable store sales from the month during which renovation commences until the first full month after reopening 
the average retail price per unit sold during fiscal increased from fiscal and the total number of units sold increased by 
the increase in the average retail price per unit sold and the increase in the number of units sold were due to an increase in customer traffic and various store level promotions 
sow s consignment sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in sow s net sales is due primarily to an increase in sales by sow s largest customer as well as sales from one new consignment arrangement during fiscal the decrease in wholesale sales of million is the result of less product availability for the wholesale division and less customer demand during fiscal compared with the prior year

perfumania s retail gross profit for fiscal increased by to million compared with million in for these same periods  perfumania s retail gross margins were and  respectively 
operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include payroll and related benefits for our distribution center  sales  store operations  field management  purchasing and other corporate office and administrative personnel  rent  common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities for our stores  distribution center and corporate office  advertising  consignment fees  sales promotion  insurance  supplies  freight out  and other administrative expenses

these service agreements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
at the end of both fiscal and fiscal  we conducted an internal review of the company s long lived assets and determined that the carrying value of certain assets exceeded their future undiscounted cash flows 
we then determined the fair value of the identified long lived assets by discounting their future cash flows using a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital  which resulted in impairment charges of approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
we also recorded impairment charges of approximately million relating to a capital lease on a building during both fiscal years and merger related expenses during fiscal consist mainly of legal and investment banking fees incurred for the pending 
table of contents merger with parlux 
see further discussion at item of this form k 
depreciation and amortization was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal as a result of the foregoing  we recognized income from operations in fiscal of approximately million compared to income from operations in fiscal of million 
other expenses for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage decrease interest expense interest expense was approximately million for fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense is due to a lower average outstanding balance and a lower overall average interest rate on the company s revolving credit facility during fiscal compared with fiscal  a lower overall average interest rate on the company s outstanding notes payable to affiliates during fiscal compared with fiscal and a decrease in the amortization of deferred finance costs in fiscal compared with fiscal income tax provision for the year ended in thousands january  january  percentage decrease income tax provision benefit our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared with a benefit of for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rates differed from our federal statutory rates primarily due to changes in our valuation allowances and net operating loss adjustments and expirations 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate differed from our federal statutory rate primarily because the company was able to carryback a portion of its net operating loss to the previously filed federal tax return of model reorg  inc  a predecessor company model reorg  resulting in a claim for refund of federal income taxes of approximately million 
during fiscal  the amount of the claim was reduced to approximately million as a result of an irs examination 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider past taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
the company continues to provide a full valuation allowance on all deferred tax assets 
net income as a result of the foregoing  we realized a net income of approximately million in fiscal  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal funding requirements are for inventory purchases  financing extended terms on accounts receivable  paying down accounts payable and debt  information systems enhancements  opening new stores and renovation of existing stores 
these capital requirements generally have been satisfied through cash flows from operations  borrowings under the respective revolving credit facilities and notes payable to affiliates 
our liquidity is impacted by a number of factors  including sales levels  the amount of credit that our vendors extend to us and our borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility is a million revolving secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks  which is used for our general corporate purposes and those of its subsidiaries  including working capital 
revolving loans under the senior credit 
table of contents facility may be drawn  repaid and reborrowed up to the amount available under a borrowing base calculated with reference to a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible credit card receivables  a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible trade receivables and a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible inventory from time to time  which may be reduced by the lender in its reasonable discretion 
the senior credit facility also includes a sub limit of million for letters of credit and a sub limit of million for swing line loans that is  same day loans from the lead or agent bank 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are co borrowers under the senior credit facility  and our other subsidiaries have guaranteed all of their obligations 
the company and its subsidiaries are required to maintain availability under the facility of at least the greater of of the aggregate amount that may be advanced against eligible credit card receivables  trade receivables and inventory or million 
at january   we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants under the senior credit facility and we had borrowing availability of million  based on the borrowing base at that date 
we also have a number of unsecured notes payable outstanding to certain family trusts of members of the nussdorf family that in aggregate total million of principal 
no payments of principal may be made on any of these notes payable to affiliates before the maturity of the senior credit facility  although interest payments are permitted under certain conditions  including the company s maintaining excess availability under the senior credit facility of million or of commitment and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the senior credit facility  of further information about the senior credit facility and these notes payable to affiliates is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company expects to obtain financing for the cash portion of the consideration payable in the parlux merger from two sources 
first  it will use borrowings under the senior credit facility of up to million which amount would be reduced to the extent that cash and cash equivalents held by parlux at the closing of the merger are less than million to fund a portion of the merger consideration and up to million to fund costs of the merger and related transactions 
second  it will borrow a total of million from the nussdorf family trusts described above  which amount will be subordinated to the senior credit facility on the same basis as the company s existing indebtedness to the trusts 
cash provided by used in operating activities primarily represents income before depreciation and non cash charges and after changes in working capital 
working capital is significantly impacted by changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the million increase in cash flows from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net income for fiscal compared with the net loss in fiscal and changes in working capital 
our accounts receivables decreased in fiscal due to lower wholesale sales in fiscal compared to fiscal inventory levels decreased in fiscal due to an effort by management to optimize and reduce inventory levels resulting in lower inventory purchases  and accounts payable fluctuations are generally determined by the timing of merchandise purchases and payments 
our purchases from related parties described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements are generally payable in days  however due to the seasonality of our business  these terms are generally extended 
related party accounts have historically been brought closer to terms at the end of the holiday season 
during the rest of the year  the company has relied upon these extended terms to provide a portion of its liquidity 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fiscal investing activities primarily involved spending for renovation of existing stores  opening new perfumania stores and relocating stores  as well as information technology and other corporate enhancements 
at january   perfumania operated stores 
we plan to open a minimum of stores in fiscal and plan to close approximately stores 
we anticipate we will spend approximately million in fiscal on capital expenditures  which will be used for perfumania new store construction and remodels  and information technology enhancements 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions change 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was approximately million  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal the fiscal increase in cash used in financing activities reflects a decrease in the balance of the bank line of credit due to the timing of payments to our accounts payable vendors 
a summary of our cash flows for fiscal and fiscal is as follows in thousands 
table of contents fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  summary cash flow information cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash balances and the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  our affiliated borrowings and our projected future operating results will generate sufficient liquidity to support the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service in the short and long term 
however  as discussed above  the amount of availability under the senior credit facility depends on our eligible receivables and inventory at any given time  and may be further reduced by our bankers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our bankers also would have the right to terminate our senior credit facility if we default on our covenants  which would require us to seek alternative financing in a highly unfavorable credit environment 
furthermore  the state of the national economy may worsen  which would further restrict customers ability to purchase fragrance products 
any of these circumstances  as well as any of the matters discussed in risk factors above  could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition  so there can be no assurance that management s plans and expectations will be successful 
significant contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at january  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at january   while others are disclosed as future obligations 
payments due by periods total less than year years years more than years revolving credit facility notes payable affiliate capital lease obligations operating lease obligations minimum royalty obligations other this balance represents principal only as the interest rate is variable and accrues on outstanding balances which vary throughout the year 
excludes projected sublease revenue we anticipate receiving on excess facility space 
excludes any amounts related to maintenance  taxes  insurance and other charges payable under operating lease agreements due to the future variability of these amounts 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k
