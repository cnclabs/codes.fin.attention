item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto included under item of this annual report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to our future results 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to management decisions and various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the potential effects of natural disasters affecting our suppliers or trading partners  the effects of labor strikes  weather conditions that may affect sales  volatility in fuel  utility  transportation and security costs  changes in global or regional political or economic conditions  including changes in governmental and central bank policies  changes in business conditions in the furniture industry  including changes in consumer spending patterns and demand for home furnishings  effects of our brand awareness and marketing programs  including changes in demand for our existing and new products  our ability to locate new design center sites and or negotiate favorable lease terms for additional design centers or for the expansion of existing design centers  competitive factors  including changes in products or marketing efforts of others  pricing pressures  fluctuations in interest rates and the cost  availability and quality of raw materials  the effects of terrorist attacks or conflicts or wars involving the united states or its allies or trading partners  those matters discussed in items a and a of this annual report and in our sec filings  and our future decisions 
accordingly  actual circumstances and results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles that require  in some cases  that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
estimates are based on currently known facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and these differences could be material 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments  affect our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write downs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  title and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  no specific performance obligations remain  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer or a fixed schedule of delivery is agreed upon and in place  collectability is reasonably assured 
as such  revenue recognition generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent retailers or  in the case of ethan allen operated retail design centers  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
we permit our customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments  and terms we offer are standard for the industry 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectability of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
retail design center acquisitions we account for the acquisition of retail design centers and related assets with the purchase method 
accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may exceed its fair value 
when testing goodwill for impairment  we may assess qualitative factors for some or all of our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  including goodwill 
alternatively  we may bypass this qualitative assessment for some or all of our reporting units and determine whether the carrying value exceeds the fair value using a quantitative assessment as described below 
the recoverability of long lived assets are evaluated for impairment by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
to evaluate goodwill using a quantitative assessment  the company determines the current fair value of the reporting units using a combination of market and income approaches 
in the market approach  the guideline company method is used  which focuses on comparing the company s risk profile and growth prospects to reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
key assumptions used for the guideline company method are total invested capital tic multiples for revenues and operating cash flows  as well as consideration of control premiums 
the tic multiples are determined based on public furniture companies within our peer group  and if appropriate  recent comparable transactions are considered 
control premiums are determined using recent comparable transactions in the open market 
under the income approach  a discounted cash flow method is used  which includes a terminal value  and is based on external analyst financial projection estimates  as well as internal financial projection estimates prepared by management 
the long term terminal growth rate assumptions reflect our current long term view of the market in which we compete 
discount rates use the weighted average cost of capital for companies within our peer group  adjusted for specific company risk premium factors 
the fair value of our trade name  which is the company s only indefinite lived intangible asset other than goodwill  is valued using the relief from royalty method 
significant factors used in trade name valuation are rates for royalties  future growth  and a discount factor 
royalty rates are determined using an average of recent comparable values 
future growth rates are based on the company s perception of the long term values in the market in which we compete  and the discount rate is determined using the weighted average cost of capital for companies within our peer group  adjusted for specific company risk premium factors 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a qualitative assessment of the fair value of the wholesale reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of its goodwill exceeded its carrying value 
in fiscal years and the company performed a quantitative assessment and determined the fair value of its wholesale reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin 
the fair value of the trade name exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin in fiscal years  and to calculate fair value of these assets  management relies on estimates and assumptions which by their nature have varying degrees of uncertainty 
wherever possible  management therefore looks for third party transactions as described above to provide the best possible support for the assumptions incorporated 
management considers several factors to be significant when estimating fair value including expected financial outlook of the business  changes in the company s stock price  the impact of changing market conditions on financial performance and expected future cash flows  and other factors 
deterioration in any of these factors may result in a lower fair value assessment  which could lead to impairment of the long lived assets and goodwill of the company 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
additional factors that we consider when making judgments about the deferred tax valuation include tax law changes  a recent history of cumulative losses  and variances in future projected profitability 
the company evaluates quarterly uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns for recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure in its financial statements 
if an income tax position exceeds a probability of success upon tax audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  the company recognizes an income tax benefit in its financial statements 
the tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a long term liability except for the amount for which a cash payment is expected to be made or tax positions settled within one year 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
business insurance reserves we have insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject to various stop loss limitations 
we accrue estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although we believe that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we adjust insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves we have a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  tax liabilities  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with our counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
basis of presentation as of june   ethan allen interiors inc has no material assets other than its ownership of the capital stock of ethan allen global  inc and conducts all significant transactions through ethan allen global  inc  therefore  substantially all of the financial information presented herein is that of ethan allen global  inc results of operations our company and the furniture industry remain in a slow recovery period following the great recession in the united states and abroad 
total unemployment remained persistently above in fiscal  consumer confidence remains low  and capital markets volatile 
on the positive side  housing starts and housing turnover have improved this year  and year mortgage rates are at an all time low 
we have seen consumer spending slowly improve beginning in fiscal  but economic recovery remains slow 
throughout this economic downturn and slow recovery period  we continued to take actions to significantly reduce costs and increase revenue 
during fiscal  having consolidated our us manufacturing footprint to six facilities  where approximately of our products are made  we increased our manufacturing capacity by expanding our upholstery plant in mexico and acquired a case goods plant in honduras 
we estimate our manufacturing facilities are currently operating at approximately of capacity and we believe we have sufficient scalable capacity domestically and abroad to meet higher volumes of demand 
our retail design centers are supported by retail service centers operated by the company  plus six third party service companies at june  we continuously reexamine our retail footprint to optimize our structure to do more business and improve profitability 
at june  and june   the company operated design centers 
independent retailers operated design centers at june  compared with at june  the increase in international design centers increased our international net sales to of our consolidated net sales for the year ended june   with most of the growth in sales and number of design centers coming from china  where the number of design centers increased to at june   from at june  despite continued macroeconomic uncertainties and highly competitive conditions for our industry  both our wholesale and retail business segments continue to make substantial progress 
we have now had ten consecutive quarters of year over year sales growth and eight consecutive quarterly profits 
during fiscal we added associates in our manufacturing segment to support our expanded capacity  and in our retail segment to grow sales 
during the last three quarters of fiscal  the company introduced significantly more new products than normal  incurring significant costs in refreshing our design center display inventory 
we also continued to increase our spending in marketing and advertising to broaden our reach to a larger demographic audience 
in taking these actions to grow the business  we continue to operate the business with cautious optimism while aggressively pursuing our business objectives 
income tax valuation allowance as a result of losses we sustained for fiscal and  which were brought on by the severe economic factors which began in fiscal  we recorded a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  with a non cash charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  our operations had returned to a position of cumulative pre tax operating profits for the most recent month period  we had eight consecutive quarters of pre tax operating profits  our written business and backlog had grown significantly  and our business plan projected continued profitability 
the preponderance of this positive evidence provides support that our future tax benefits more likely than not will be realized 
accordingly  at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  we released all of united states federal  most of the state  and all of the canadian valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for the reversal of the valuation allowance against those assets  with a non cash benefit to earnings in the quarter ended march  previously unrealized tax benefits of million were also realized during the quarter ended march  we retained a valuation allowance against various state and local deferred tax assets in our retail segment 
at june  this valuation allowance was approximately million 
restructuring activities at june   there is a remaining liability of million for non cancellable lease obligations with expirations ranging from less than two to years resulting from consolidation actions taken in fiscal and changes in the estimated future costs of these obligations are included as restructuring and impairment charges in the statement of operations  and the company s restructuring reserve is classified with accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
business results our revenues are comprised of i wholesale sales to independently operated and company operated retail design centers and ii retail sales of company operated design centers 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  included under item of this annual report 
the components of consolidated revenues and operating income loss are as follows in millions fiscal year ended june  revenue wholesale segment retail segment elimination of inter segment sales consolidated revenue operating income loss wholesale segment retail segment adjustment for inter company profit consolidated operating income operating income for the wholesale segment for the twelve months ended june includes pre tax restructuring and impairment charges credit of million 
operating income for the retail segment for the twelve months ended june  and includes pre tax restructuring and impairment charges credit of million  million and million  respectively 
represents the change in wholesale profit contained in ethan allen operated design center inventory existing at the end of the period 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal there was year over year growth in both the wholesale and retail segments  in both net sales  and written orders 
we believe this growth is due to i continued new and innovative marketing initiatives including promotional pricing and our interactive web site ethanallen 
com  ii the positive effects of our national television and direct mail media campaigns  iii an increase in the number of our highly skilled interior designers and other retail associates  iv significant new product introductions during the year  and v our continued repositioning of the retail network 
wholesale revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the incoming order rate for the first half of fiscal  as we began to see a gradual though inconsistent improvement in consumer spending 
orders during the second half of fiscal decreased  compared to a very strong same prior year period  but were up over the first half of fiscal for the full year  orders increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we believe this improvement in year over year sales and orders is due to our promotional activities  significant new product offerings  our ability to increase production through operating efficiencies  staffing increases  and an increase in the number of total design centers globally to at june  from at june  the independently operated retail network grew by twelve net design centers to at june  including a net increase of locations to in china 
while the count of ethan allen operated design centers was at june of and  we opened two new locations  relocated two others  closed five and acquired three design centers during the current fiscal year 
retail revenue from ethan allen operated design centers for the twelve months ended june  increased by million  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended june  we believe the increase in retail sales by ethan allen operated design centers is due to our promotional marketing campaigns and the design solutions approach of our interior design professionals  continued use of both our national television and direct mail media  our digital communications to prospective clients  the positive effects of repositioning the retail network  and an increase in the number of highly skilled interior designers  retail management  and other retail associates 
we ended both the current and prior fiscal years with ethan allen operated design centers as noted above 
comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations of newly opened including relocated design centers 
design centers acquired by us from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their th full month of ethan allen owned operations 
year over year  written business of ethan allen operated design centers increased and comparable design centers written business increased 
the frequency of our promotional events as well as the timing of the end of those events can impact the orders booked during a given period 
each year we make considerable investments to strengthen the level of service  professionalism  interior design competence  efficiency  and effectiveness of the retail design center personnel 
we believe that over time  we will continue to benefit from i our repositioning of the retail network  ii new product introductions  iii new marketing promotions  and our interior design affiliate ida program  iv continued use of technology coupled with personal service from our design professionals and our touch screen displays  and v ongoing use of targeted advertising media 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the million increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to i an overall increase in net sales of  with increases in both segments  ii improved operating efficiencies  iii improved product mix within the wholesale segment  and iv the higher mix of retail net sales to consolidated net sales in the current year compared to the prior year period 
with our additional manufacturing capacity in mexico and honduras we operated at approximately of capacity during fiscal compared to in fiscal the consolidated gross margin increased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result  primarily  of the factors set forth above 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in current year expenses is primarily due to the increase in sales which primarily affected commissions and delivery and warehousing costs  ii increased compensation and benefit costs primarily from increased investments in retail management  designers and other associates  iii increased costs associated with our significant new product introductions in the current fiscal year  iv a loss on the sale of real estate in our retail segment during the second quarter of fiscal  v an increase in our it costs due to investments in technology across the business in fiscal  and vi higher advertising costs 
operating income for the year ended june  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
wholesale operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
retail operating loss was million  or of sales  for fiscal  compared to a loss of million  or of sales  for fiscal  an improvement of million 
improvements in operating income in both segments was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume  but also arose from continuing operating efficiencies achieved 
interest and other income  net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease was mostly due to a decrease in miscellaneous non operating fees during the current fiscal year and the recording in fiscal of a million out of period adjustment benefiting the prior fiscal year  related to non operating income in prior years 
interest and other related financing costs decreased million to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in the principal amount of our senior unsecured debt outstanding as a result of our repurchases of an aggregate of million of that debt during fiscal  which followed fiscal aggregate repurchases of million 
income tax was a benefit of million for fiscal as compared to a benefit of million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was a negative compared to a negative in fiscal the current year effective tax rate includes the benefit from the reversal of valuation allowance  and the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits  partly offset by tax expense on the current year s net income  recording additional uncertain tax positions and interest expense on uncertain tax positions 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by a tax benefit from the reduction in valuation allowance due to a decrease in deferred tax assets which were subject to a full valuation allowance 
the rate was also impacted by a net tax benefit from the expiration of the statute of limitations causing certain unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized  partly offset by new tax issues that were identified in the year 
net income for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal net income per diluted share totaled in the current year compared to per diluted share in the prior year 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal there was year over year growth in both the wholesale and retail segments  for net sales  written orders  and backlogs 
we believe this growth was due to i continued new and innovative marketing initiatives including promotional pricing and our interactive web site ethanallen 
com  ii a significant increase in advertising  where we continued to invest in national television and direct mail media  emphasizing to our target audience our interior design services and the full line of our quality product offerings  iii increased use of digital communications including periodic distribution of e magazines to increase client exposures and drive traffic to our website and design centers  iv an increase in the number of our highly skilled interior designers and other retail associates  and v our continued repositioning of the retail network 
wholesale revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the incoming order rate as we began to see a gradual though inconsistent improvement in consumer spending 
we believe this improvement was due to our promotional activities  our ability to increase production through operating efficiencies  staffing increases  and to a lesser extent  an increase in the number of total design centers globally to at june   from at june  the independently operated retail network grew by five net design centers to at june  and there were two net additional ethan allen operated design centers 
wholesale orders increased in fiscal compared to fiscal retail revenue from ethan allen operated design centers for the twelve months ended june  increased by million  or  to million from million for the twelve months ended june  we believe the increase in retail sales by ethan allen operated design centers was due to our promotional marketing campaigns and the design solutions approach of our interior design professionals  increases in advertising  where we continued to invest in national television and direct mail media  our digital communications to prospective clients  the positive effects of repositioning the retail network  and an increase in the number of highly skilled interior designers  retail management  and other retail associates  and by a net increase of two ethan allen operated design centers between june  and june  we ended the fiscal year with ethan allen operated design centers  including six acquired from independent dealers since june  comparable design centers are those which have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations of newly opened including relocated design centers 
design centers acquired by us from independent retailers are included in comparable design center sales in their th full month of ethan allen owned operations 
year over year  written business of ethan allen operated design centers increased and comparable design centers written business increased

we have made considerable investment within the retail network to strengthen the level of service  professionalism  interior design competence  efficiency  and effectiveness of the retail design center personnel 
we believe that over time  we will continue to benefit from i our repositioning of the retail network  ii new product introductions  iii new marketing promotions  and our interior design affiliate ida program  iv continued use of technology including our state of the art website coupled with personal service from our design professionals and our touch screen displays  and v ongoing use of targeted advertising media 
gross profit for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the million increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to i a combined increase in both wholesale and retail sales of  ii the benefit in fiscal of a full year of streamlined and more efficient manufacturing processes which were in progress during the previous fiscal year  and iii to a lesser extent some net pricing benefit and higher average merchandise sales per invoice 
with the improvements in orders  we operated our plants at approximately of capacity during fiscal  up from in fiscal the consolidated gross margin increased to for fiscal from in fiscal as a result  primarily  of the factors set forth above 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in fiscal year expenses and the decrease as a percent of sales are primarily due to the increase in sales which primarily affected commissions and delivery and warehousing costs 
there was also a million increase in commission charges in the fiscal year  due to a change in the commission structure made in fiscal we also increased our investment in our advertising campaigns driving those expenses million or higher 
consolidated operating income for the year ended june  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to a loss of million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the improvement of million was largely attributable to i the million increase in net sales  and ii operating efficiencies noted earlier as a result of the restructuring completed in fiscal wholesale operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in the prior year 
the increase of million was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume and operating efficiencies of our manufacturing plants and wholesale logistics operations 
retail operating loss was million  or of sales  for fiscal  compared to a loss of million  or of sales  for fiscal  an improvement of million 
the increase in net sales and the positive effects of cost cutting efforts taken in recent years were the primary drivers  partly offset by the benefit in from the change in commission structure  our fiscal year increased investment in advertising  and our retail staffing increases aimed at driving continued growth in the business 
interest and other income  net totaled million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million increase was mostly due to the recording of a million out of period adjustment related to non operating income recorded in the first quarter of fiscal interest and other related financing costs decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in the principal amount of our senior unsecured debt outstanding as a result of our repurchases of an aggregate of million of that debt during fiscal income tax was a benefit of million for fiscal as compared to expense of million for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was a negative compared to a negative in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal was impacted by a tax benefit from the reduction in valuation allowance due to a decrease in deferred tax assets which were subject to a full valuation allowance 
the rate was also impacted by a net tax benefit from the expiration of the statute of limitations causing certain unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized  partly offset by new tax issues that were identified in the year 
the significant decrease in the valuation allowance recorded was due primarily to a change in tax accounting methods applied in the company s us federal tax filing for the fiscal year ended june  which accelerated tax expenses for depreciation  inventory and professional fees that were previously treated as deferred tax assets 
this change resulted in an increase in the us federal and state net operating losses nol reported for the fiscal year ended june  the federal nol was carried back to fiscal year ended june  net income for fiscal was million as compared to a net loss of million in fiscal net income per diluted share totaled in the current year compared to net loss of per diluted share in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   we held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million  and marketable securities of million 
we also held million in cash equivalents in restricted accounts in lieu of letters of credit to minimize interest expense 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  cash flow from operations  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  and other borrowings 
the company has a senior secured  asset based  revolving credit facility the facility which provides revolving credit financing of up to million  subject to borrowing base availability  and includes a right for the company to increase the total facility to million either with existing or additional lenders subject to certain conditions 
the facility expires march   or june  if the company s senior notes as defined below have not been refinanced 
at the company s option  revolving loans under the facility bear interest at an annual rate of either a london interbank offered rate libor plus to  based on the average availability  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii libor plus plus  in each case  an additional to  based on average availability 
the company pays a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the facility and participation fees on issued letters of credit at an annual rate of to  based on the average availability and the letter of credit type 
if the average monthly availability is less than the greater of i of the aggregate commitment and ii million  the company s fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than to for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters 
certain payments are restricted if the availability of the collateral supporting the facility falls below million or of the facility size 
the facility is secured by all property owned  leased or operated by the company in the united states excluding any real property owned by the company and contains customary covenants which may limit the company s ability to incur debt  engage in mergers and consolidations  make restricted payments including dividends  sell certain assets  and make investments 
at june   we had no revolving loans and million of standby and trade letters of credit outstanding under the facility 
remaining availability under the facility totaled million subject to limitations set forth in the agreement and as a result  the coverage charge ratio  and other restricted payment limitations did not apply 
in september  we issued million in ten year senior unsecured notes due the senior notes 
the senior notes were issued by global  bearing an annual coupon rate of with interest payable semi annually in arrears on april and october we used the net proceeds of million to improve our retail network  invest in our manufacturing and logistics operations  and for other general corporate purposes 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company repurchased an aggregate million of the senior notes in several unsolicited transactions 
as of june   we are in compliance with all covenants of the facility and our senior notes 
a summary of net cash provided by used in operating  investing  and financing activities for each of the last three fiscal years is provided below in millions fiscal year ended june  operating activities net income loss plus depreciation and amortization working capital items other operating activities total provided by operating activities investing activities capital expenditures acquisitions net sales purchases of marketable securities other investing activities total used in investing activities financing activities payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations purchases and retirements of company stock payment of cash dividends other financing activities total used in financing activities operating activities in fiscal  cash of million was generated by operating activities  a decrease of million over fiscal net income plus depreciation and amortization improved by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a million increase in net sales 
cash flow of million was used for working capital items defined below in the current fiscal year  an increase in cash outflows of million compared to fiscal increased inventory levels to support the new ethan allen express program contributed to a net increase in cash used for inventory of million  and customer deposits and accounts payable balances grew during fiscal but the amount of the increase was million lower than during fiscal other operating activities includes income tax payments of million made in fiscal compared to net income tax refunds of million received in fiscal as a result of a prior year tax method change  for a net swing of million 
working capital consists of accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid and other current assets  less customer deposits  payables  accrued expenses  and other current liabilities 
investing activities in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities  which is million more cash used than in fiscal this was due primarily to an million increase in capital spending and acquisitions  which was used to support our design center development and renovation  expansion of our case goods operations in honduras  and our investments in our business systems 
this was partly offset by a million increase in net sales of marketable securities 
we anticipate that cash from operations will be sufficient to fund future capital expenditures  business conditions permitting 
financing activities in fiscal  million was used in financing activities  which is million less cash than used in financing activities in fiscal this was principally due to a decrease in the amount of our senior note repurchases to million this year compared to million in fiscal  and a million reduction in our stock repurchases in fiscal we paid dividends of per common share each quarter in fiscal and per common share in fiscal on april   we declared dividends of per common share  payable on july  we expect to continue to declare quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future 
as of june   our outstanding debt totaled million  the current and long term portions of which amounted to less than million and million  respectively 
the aggregate scheduled maturities of long term debt for each of the next five fiscal years are million in each of fiscal   and  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal and thereafter 
the following table summarizes  as of june   the timing of cash payments related to our outstanding contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest operating lease obligations letters of credit purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations for purposes of this table  purchase obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
while we are not a party to any significant long term supply contracts or purchase commitments  we do  in the normal course of business  regularly initiate purchase orders for the procurement of i selected finished goods sourced from third party suppliers  ii lumber  fabric  leather and other raw materials used in production  and iii certain outsourced services 
all purchase orders are based on current needs and are fulfilled by suppliers within short time periods 
at june   our open purchase orders with respect to such goods and services totaled approximately million 
further discussion of our contractual obligations associated with outstanding debt and lease arrangements can be found in notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our other available sources of liquidity  will be adequate to make all required payments of principal and interest on our debt  to permit anticipated capital expenditures  and to fund working capital and other cash requirements 
as of june   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of to in addition to using available cash to fund changes in working capital  necessary capital expenditures  acquisition activity  the repayment of debt  and the payment of dividends  the company has been authorized by our board of directors to repurchase our common stock  from time to time  either directly or through agents  in the open market at prices and on terms satisfactory to us

as such  we do not maintain any i retained or contingent interests  ii derivative instruments  or iii variable interests which could serve as a source of potential risk to our future liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
we may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  provide guarantees on behalf of selected affiliated entities or become contractually obligated to perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of certain business agreements 
the nature and extent of these guarantees and obligations may vary based on our underlying relationship with the benefiting party and the business purpose for which the guarantee or obligation is being provided 
the only such program in place at june  was for our consumer credit program 
ethan allen consumer credit program the terms and conditions of our consumer credit program  which is financed and administered by a third party financial institution on a non recourse basis to ethan allen  are set forth in an agreement between the company and that financial service provider the program agreement 
any independent retailer choosing to participate in the consumer credit program is required to enter into a separate agreement with that same third party financial institution which sets forth the terms and conditions under which the retailer is to perform in connection with its offering of consumer credit to its customers the retailer agreement 
we have obligated ourselves on behalf of any independent retailer choosing to participate in our consumer credit program by agreeing  in the event of default  breach  or failure of the independent retailer to perform under such retailer agreement  to take on certain responsibilities of the independent retailer  including  but not limited to  delivery of goods and reimbursement of customer deposits 
customer receivables originated by independent retailers remain non recourse to ethan allen 
our obligation remains in effect for the term of the program agreement that expires in july while the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted that we could be required to make under this obligation is indeterminable  recourse provisions exist that would enable us to recover  from the independent retailer  any amount paid or incurred by us related to our performance 
based on the underlying creditworthiness of our independent retailers  including their historical ability to satisfactorily perform in connection with the terms of our consumer credit program  we believe this obligation will expire without requiring funding by us 
to ensure funding for delivery of products sold  the terms of this agreement also contain a right for the credit card issuer to demand from the company collateral of up to million if the company does not meet certain covenants 
as of june   the company had established a restricted cash and investment collateral account of million to satisfy the current requirement under this demand 
product warranties our products  including our case goods  upholstery and home accents  generally carry explicit product warranties that extend from three to seven years and are provided based on terms that are generally accepted in the industry 
all of our domestic independent retailers are required to enter into  and perform in accordance with the terms and conditions of  a warranty service agreement 
we record provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and make periodic adjustments to those provisions to reflect actual experience 
on rare occasion  certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
in certain cases  a material warranty issue may arise which is beyond the scope of our historical experience 
we provide for such warranty issues as they become known and are deemed to be both probable and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that  from time to time  additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of our historical experience 
as of june   the company s product warranty liability totaled million 
impact of inflation we believe inflation had an impact on our business the last three fiscal years but we have generally been able to create operational efficiencies  seek lower cost alternatives  or raise selling prices in order to offset increases in product and operating costs 
it is possible in the future that we will not be successful in our efforts to offset the impacts from inflation 
business outlook certain macroeconomic factors that affect our clients  such as housing starts  housing turnover  total unemployment rates and long term mortgage rates have improved somewhat during the current fiscal year 
other important factors have not improved  such as consumer credit availability and consumer sentiment 
consequently  we remain cautiously optomistic but feel this recovery is still fragile 
along with economic challenge comes opportunity  and our philosophy has been and continues to be to aggressively pursue our business objectives as we proceed with care 
as macro economic factors change  it is possible that our costs associated with production including raw materials and labor  distribution including freight and fuel charges  and retail operations including compensation and benefits  delivery and warehousing  occupancy  and advertising expenses may increase 
we may also experience production difficulties as we continue to match the capacity of our manufacturing plants to demand  and to improve efficiency in our custom case goods production 
we cannot reasonably predict when  or to what extent  such events may occur or what effect  if any  such events may have on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the home furnishings industry remains extremely competitive with respect to both the sourcing of products and the wholesale and retail sale of those products 
domestic manufacturers continue to face pricing pressures because of the lower manufacturing costs of some other countries  particularly within asia 
in response to these pressures  a large number of us furniture manufacturers have increased their overseas sourcing to retain market share 
while we have also turned to overseas sourcing to remain competitive  we choose to differentiate ourselves by maintaining a substantial domestic manufacturing base 
consequently  we make and or assemble approximately of our products domestically 
we continue to believe that a balanced approach to product sourcing  which includes the domestic manufacture of certain product offerings coupled with the import of other selected products  provides the greatest degree of flexibility and is the most effective approach to ensuring that acceptable levels of quality  service and value are attained 
our retail strategy involves i a continued focus on providing a wide array of product solutions and superior interior design solutions  ii the opening of new or relocated design centers in more prominent locations  while encouraging independent retailers to do the same  and iii leveraging the use of technology and personal service within our retail network  and iv further expansion internationally 
we believe this strategy provides an opportunity to grow our business 
further discussion of the home furnishings industry has been included under item of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendment requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
this asu is effective for financial statements for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  july  for the company  and must be applied retrospectively 
in september  the fasb issued asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu permits an entity to make a qualitiative assessment of whether it is more likely than not a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill test 
if an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test as required in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the company adopted the provisions of asu and performed a qualitative assessment as of april  the implementation of this pronouncement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exists primarily through our borrowing activities 
we utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund substantially all our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and our future financing requirements 
for floating rate obligations  interest rate changes do not affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but would impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate obligations  interest rate changes affect the fair value of the underlying financial instrument but would not impact earnings or cash flows 
at june   we had no floating rate debt obligations outstanding 
as of that same date  our fixed rate debt obligations consisted  primarily  of the senior notes issued on september  the estimated fair value of the senior notes as of june   which is based on changes  if any  in interest rates and our creditworthiness subsequent to the date on which the debt was issued  and which has been determined using quoted market prices  was million as compared to a carrying value of million 
foreign currency exchange risk is primarily limited to our operation of five ethan allen operated retail design centers located in canada and our plants in mexico and honduras  as substantially all purchases of imported parts and finished goods are denominated in united states dollars 
as such  gains or losses resulting from market changes in the value of foreign currencies have not had  nor are they expected to have  a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies in particular asian relative to the united states dollar may affect the profitability of our vendors but as we employ a balanced sourcing strategy  we believe any impact would be moderate relative to peers in the industry
