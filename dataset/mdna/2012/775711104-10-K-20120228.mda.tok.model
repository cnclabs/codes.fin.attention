on march   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and bank of america  na for an unsecured line of credit of up to million  which includes a million letter of credit subfacility  and a million swingline subfacility 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility 
the company maintains approximately million in letters of credit 
these letters of credit are required by the company s fronting insurance companies and or certain states  due to the company s self insured status  to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage 
the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets  funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims 
the revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by rollins domestic subsidiaries 
the maturity date of the credit agreement is march  revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates  at the company s election the base rate  which is the highest of suntrust bank s prime rate for the day of the borrowing  a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the federal funds rate plus or the adjusted libor rate determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one month  or with respect to any eurodollar borrowings  adjusted libor which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the us federal reserve plus an additional amount  which varies between

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than the operating leases disclosed in the table that follows  the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
the impact that the company s contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years business combination related liabilities non cancelable operating leases unrecognized tax positions total these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  uncertain tax positions of million are not included due to the uncertainty of the final amount and settlement 
minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required 
the company is considering making contributions to its pension plans of approximately million during critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repairs and associated labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs relative to termite control services 
factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company s business practices 
however  it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims 
accrual for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long term accrued liabilities on the company s consolidated statements of financial position 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
management s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management s knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims 
initiatives that have been implemented include pre employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required 
table of contents on all its drivers  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly  bi monthly or quarterly basis  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting 
at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation  the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring services 
a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element 
this portion is recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price 
there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
revenue received for termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  and  the cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred 
for outstanding claims  an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information 
the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts  these costs are incurred over the contract term 
as the revenue is being deferred  the future cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred 
the company accrues for noticed claims 
the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 
all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 
contingency accruals the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  the company estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation 
estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel 
because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation  judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued 
however  in the opinion of management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long term accrued liabilities on the company s consolidated statements of financial position 
defined benefit pension plans in  the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins  inc defined benefit plan  although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through march the company has other smaller pension plans related to acquisitions included in note to the company s financial statements 
the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in 
table of contents accordance with fasb asc topic compensation retirement benefits  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs 
with the assistance of the actuary  the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets  the discount rate  and other factors  and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes  the investments strategy  and the views of our investment adviser 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
the company s assumption for the expected return on plan assets is which is unchanged from the prior year 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company utilizes a yield curve approach 
the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company s expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year 
the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds 
the discount rate was as of december  compared to in and in a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 
as set forth in note to the company s financial statements  included among the asset categories for the plan s investments are real estate  tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds 
these investments are categorized as level investments and are valued using significant non observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value 
in accordance with asu no 
investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested 
these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect  resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments 
the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness 
as of december   the defined benefit plans were under funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income increased stockholders equity by million before tax and million after tax 
new accounting standards recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements that include multiple revenue generating activities  and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables  and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in asu also establish a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms of the arrangement  significant deliverables  and the vendor s performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   or january  for us 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued asu which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  however  an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard  provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test or issued its financial statements 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu to topic  balance sheet 
the update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements 
for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities  the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts  amounts offset on the balance sheet  and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective december  and is to be applied retrospectively 
this guidance does not amend the existing guidance on when it is appropriate to offset  as a result  we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this standard eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
under this standard  an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
asu defers the effective date of the requirement in asu to disclose on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income 
all other requirements of asu are not affected by asu the company adopted asu effective december  and deferred certain disclosures as allowed under asu asu did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the expiration of deferral allowed by asu is not expected to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements
