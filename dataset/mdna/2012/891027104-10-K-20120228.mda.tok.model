item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations discontinued operations as described in note discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our subsidiary united investors life insurance company united investors as of december  because of the sale  united investors financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations are discontinued 
how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
we view our operations by segments  which are the major insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and benefit administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less interest credited to net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations net income increased slightly from million to million in it rose or million in  largely as a result of after tax realized investment gains of million in  compared with losses of million after tax in the losses included million of write downs of fixed maturities which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
realized investment gains were million in on a diluted per share basis  net income increased to  after an increase in of to 
the above mentioned after tax realized investment gains added 
to net income per diluted share and 
per share in  while the loss reduced net income 
per share of which the impairment writedowns accounted for 
of the loss 
more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 
also included in results is a million after tax loss on the disposal of united investors  representing 
per diluted share 
as shown in the above chart  after tax segment operations  before discontinued operations  rose each year over the prior year from million in to million in to million in the primary contributor to the growth in both and was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment  which margins rose million in and million in the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented 
growth in was also affected positively by the million increased contribution of excess investment income  the measure of profitability of the investment segment 
excess investment income in increased over investment segment income largely because of the unusually large holdings in low yielding cash and short term investments held in due to the uncertain economic climate at that time 
these short term holdings were invested in as financial conditions improved 
excess investment income was also negatively affected in because of our issuance of a million 
table of contents debt security in june  net proceeds of million and repayment of a million security which matured in august  these transactions resulted in a net increase in our financing costs in and reduced excess investment income 
growth in earnings was negatively affected by a decline in the health insurance segment underwriting margin of million  and a million decline in excess investment income from the investment segment 
the decline in health contribution was largely a result of the discontinuance of sales of certain limited benefit health insurance products because of healthcare reform 
the decline in excess investment income was due to the continuing low interest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads over policy benefit requirements  discussed more fully under the captain investments in this report 
total revenues were flat in at billion compared with billion in revenues increased in over revenues of billion in life premium rose or million in and million in net investment income rose or million in  compared with million in however  growth in revenues in and were negatively affected by the declines in health premium described further under this caption 
while life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december   margins as a percentage of premium rose in to from in and segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth  but also by improvements in mortality and persistency in both periods 
life net sales declined in to million but rose in to million 
life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance 
we primarily market two health insurance products medicare supplement insurance and the medicare part d prescription drug benefit 
we also market limited benefit cancer and accident health products and prior to september   an under age limited benefit hospital surgical product 
health premium declined in to million from million in health premium declined in the decreases in both years were caused primarily by the de emphasis and discontinuance of sales in of our limited benefit hospital surgical health product 
declines in agent counts in the distribution units that market our health products were another negative factor 
these factors have caused reductions in net sales of health products which have in turn pressured premium growth 
medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium  but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product in recent years  resulting in premium declines in each successive year 
our medicare part d premium declined in  after having increased in however  enrollees into our medicare part d program for the plan year were thousand  an increase of over the enrollees 
therefore  we expect premium growth in at approximately the same rate 
see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
we offer fixed annuities  but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
with the sale of united investors in  we disposed of of our annuity deposit balance 
see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 
as previously mentioned  the investment segment s pretax profitability  or excess investment income  increased million in but declined million in profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income  required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products  and financing costs 
in recent years  growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio 
one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of 
also  there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested  in which the funds are held in cash 
growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark s share repurchase program described later under this caption  which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 
in  net investment rose while the portfolio at amortized cost grew  in accordance with the general pattern in recent periods 
however  in  the growth in net investment income slightly exceeded the growth in the average portfolio for the first time in many years  primarily as a result of the special constraints on the growth in net investment income 
during  due primarily to uncertainty 
table of contents about liquidity in the financial markets  we held significantly more cash and short term investments than we normally would 
additionally  in  we sold a significant portion of higher yielding but lower rated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in lower yielding but higher rated bonds in and early to improve our risk adjusted return 
these factors contributed to reduced net investment income 
the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income  and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets 
the lower new money yields resulting from the low interest rate environment noted above have had the effect of compressing excess investment income as required interest has grown 
we have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect  including lowering the discount rate going forward and increasing premium rates on sales of new products 
financing costs  which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short term debt  are also deducted from net investment income 
financing costs in were million  an increase of over million in this increase was primarily a result of increased charges related to our letters of credit facility 
in  financing costs increased as interest expense on our long term debt rose million or 
as noted earlier  in we issued our million senior notes but repaid our million senior debentures  resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a higher interest rate in torchmark s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives 
approximately of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which were investment grade at december  the average quality rating of the portfolio was a 
the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages  no direct investment in residential mortgages  no direct investment in european sovereign debt  no counterparty risks  no credit default swaps  or derivative contracts 
see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and note investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 
as mentioned earlier  we used a portion of the million proceeds from the offering of our senior notes million par amount in to repay our million senior debentures which also matured in more information on these transactions can be found in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 
in each of the years and  income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
as reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption settlements  we have been involved in certain issues in or in which we either received settlements or incurred settlement losses and expenses 
in  we settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of million million after tax and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation settlement expected to settle in early in the pretax amount of million million after tax 
both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago 
additionally  as described under the same caption of note  we received a tax settlement in the amount of million in the tax settlement primarily involved the results of prior year examinations 
the state administrative settlement and the litigation accrual are included in other operating expense and the tax settlement is an adjustment to income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  as described in note  we remove items such as these that are concerned with prior periods when evaluating the results of current operations  and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 
torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in with no specified authorization amount  we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these 
table of contents purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
due to poor economic conditions  we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of however  in the first quarter of  the board of directors reactivated the company s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management  in consultation with the board  determines to be in the best interest of the company 
the following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended december   retroactively restated for the three for two stock split described in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
analysis of share purchases amounts in thousands purchases shares amount shares amount shares amount excess cash flow and borrowings option proceeds total option proceeds increased significantly in due to optionholders exercising several years of option grants that are due to expire in throughout the remainder of this discussion  share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings 
a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations  as described in note business segments 
life insurance 
life insurance is our largest insurance segment  with life premium representing of total premium 
life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
we completed the process of combining selected united american ua exclusive agency branch offices with the liberty national exclusive agency during for this reason  all data will be reported on a combined basis in this report 
life insurance premium rose to billion in after having increased in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total american income exclusive agency direct response liberty national exclusive agency other agencies 
table of contents we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier 
annualized life premium in force was billion at december  the following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method 
life insurance net sales by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total american income exclusive agency direct response liberty national exclusive agency other agencies the table below discloses first year collected life premium by distribution channel 
life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total american income exclusive agency direct response liberty national exclusive agency other agencies the american income exclusive agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions  but also on credit unions and other associations as well as referrals from new customers for its life insurance sales 
it is torchmark s highest profit margin business 
the american income agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any torchmark distribution method in life premium for this agency rose to million in  after having increased in net sales increased in to million  after having risen in net sales rose in first year collected premium rose in to million  after having increased in the average face amount of policies issued in was approximately thousand 
as in the case of all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely 
table of contents dependent on increases in agent count 
the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
however  the agent count had declined in from  a year earlier 
this agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business 
additionally  the systematic  centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruitment of new agents 
direct response consists of two primary components insert media and direct mail 
insert media targets primarily the adult market 
it involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media  such as coupon packets  newspapers  bank statements  and billings 
direct mail focuses primarily on young middle income households with children 
the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this group 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders 
parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a direct response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population 
also  both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
at this time  we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 
we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response s premier markets 
the direct response operation accounted for of our life insurance premium during  increasing over premium 
life premium for this channel rose in and in net sales were flat in after a increase in to million 
first year collected premium declined to million in after a gain in the average face amount of policies issued in was approximately thousand 
the liberty national exclusive agency markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance  focusing primarily on middle income customers 
life premium income for this agency was million in  a decrease compared with million in life premium for this agency declined in from first year collected premium declined to million in  after having also declined in the average face amount of policies issued in was approximately thousand 
the liberty agency s net sales declined to million in  after also having declined a year earlier 
as noted above  in the case of all of our agencies  the size of the agency drives product sales 
this agency had  producing agents at december   compared with  a year earlier  a decline of 
the agent count at liberty had also declined in from  the decrease in agent count has been due in part to the closing of several offices which had low production 
in addition  agent compensation issues that arose in have negatively impacted agent counts 
the bonus thresholds proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated 
management reduced the bonus threshold later in also  due to deteriorating first year persistency  management modified compensation incentives in to place more emphasis on the persistency of newly issued policies 
these changes resulted in the departure of a number of the less productive agents in and while these modifications caused a loss of agents  they resulted in improved persistency and margins  and contributed to torchmark s overall improvement in life insurance margins 
the liberty exclusive agency agent counts have also decreased due to issues related to its health insurance business 
this agency s health insurance marketing efforts had historically been focused on limited benefit hospital surgical plans 
these plans were subject to intense competition from other companies which offered lower margin products providing agents with products that were easier to sell  thus discouraging sales of our products and ultimately resulting in decreases in agent counts 
in addition  these limited benefit hospital surgical plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments 
sales of these limited benefit hospital surgical plans were discontinued after september  these developments caused further increases in agent turnover 
in response  the agency has shifted its marketing focus to a product mix more weighted towards life insurance and supplemental health insurance products not affected by healthcare reform that have higher margins and persistency 
additionally  we are in the process of changing the cost structure of this agency to a more commission driven model 
going forward  branch office operating expenses will be the responsibility of the branch managers and all new agent recruits will be independent contractors rather than employees 
we are also implementing new agent recruiting and training programs similar to those used at american income 
we believe these changes will increase the agency s profitability and stability in the long run 

table of contents we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency  the united american independent agency  and other small miscellaneous sales agencies 
the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders 
military premium represented of life premium at december  the united american independent agency represented approximately of torchmark s total life premium at that date 
this agency is focused on health insurance  with life sales being incidental

in the two prior years  margins were stable at 
margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth 
improved mortality was also a factor in health insurance 
health insurance sold by torchmark includes primarily medicare supplement and part d prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal medicare program  cancer coverage  and accident coverage 
all health coverage plans other than medicare supplement and part d are classified here as limited benefit plans 
for several years  our primary health insurance product had been limited benefit hospital surgical plans 
however  as previously discussed under the caption life insurance  these plans became subject to intense competition which resulted in decreasing agent counts  most notably in the liberty national exclusive agency but also in the ua independent agency 
in addition  these plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments 
these factors contributed to the company s decisions to discontinue the marketing of these limited benefit hospital surgical products after september  we do continue to market the limited benefit cancer and accident products 
since  medicare supplement sales have exceeded those of the limited benefit products  and represented of health net sales exclusive of medicare part d in medicare supplement sales have been stronger than limited benefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below 

table of contents total health premium represented of torchmark s total premium income in excluding part d premium  health premium represented of total premium income in  compared with in and in health underwriting margin  excluding part d  accounted for of the total in  compared with in and in these declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment 
health results have also been affected by the discontinuance of sales of the previously mentioned health products 
the following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years 
health insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total united american independent agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement liberty national exclusive agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement american income exclusive agency limited benefit plans medicare supplement direct response limited benefit plans medicare supplement total premium before part d limited benefit plans medicare supplement total premium before part d medicare part d total health premium total medicare part d premium and health premium exclude million in  thousand in  and million in of risk sharing premium paid to the centers for medicare and medicaid services consistent with the medicare part d contract 
this risk sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims  and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis 

table of contents we market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the united american independent agency being our market leader

the medicare part d health product will be presented and discussed separately in this report 
health insurance  excluding medicare part d 
health premium other than part d has declined in each successive year presented  falling in to million and in net sales decreased in to million after a decline of in first year collected premium has also declined in each period considered 
these declines in sales and premium resulted from several factors our previously mentioned emphasis on life sales  due to life s superior margins and its greater contribution to investment income  the discontinuance of sales of various limited benefit health products  and the decline in agent counts in certain distribution units that market health products 

table of contents medicare supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium  partially because medicare supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited benefit products  but also because of more stable sales in recent periods 
medicare supplement premium also continues to grow in relation to our limited benefit health premium 
medicare supplement premium represented of non part d health premium in  compared with in and in the liberty national exclusive agency represented of all torchmark non part d health premium income at million in the liberty agency markets medicare supplements and limited benefit health products consisting primarily of cancer insurance 
in  health premium income in this agency declined from prior year premium of million 
premium also fell in from million 
first year collected premium declined to million in  after declining a year earlier 
as noted earlier  the discontinuance of sales of certain health products and the earlier increased competition in the health insurance market had caused steep declines in the agent count in this agency 
as of december   this agency had  agents  a decline of from the year end count of  in  the number of agents fell from  at year end the decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales  translating into declines in premium 
net sales for rose from million in to million due to the introduction of new products 
in  this agency s net sales fell 
also discussed under the life insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this agency 
the ua independent agency is torchmark s largest in terms of health premium income 
this agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with torchmark whose size range from very large  multi state organizations down to one person offices 
all of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies 
torchmark had  active producing agents at december  compared with  a year earlier 
this agency is our largest distributor of non part d health insurance in terms of health net sales  representing in this agency is also our largest producer of medicare supplement insurance  with million or of our medicare supplement premium income in net sales for this agency increased to million in  after having declined in from million in the greater amount of net sales in were due to increases in group medicare supplement sales 
group medicare supplement sales fluctuate greatly from period to period and do not indicate a trend 
total health premium income for the ua independent agency was million in  a decline from premium of million 
premium income also declined in these declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses 
the american income exclusive agency  predominantly a life insurance distribution channel  is our third largest health insurance distributor based on premium income 
its health plans are comprised of various limited benefit plans 
approximately of the agency s health premium was from accident policies 
sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer 
health premium at this agency rose in to million  after having increased to million in however  net health sales declined to million in net sales were million in both and net health sales comprised only of the american income agency s total net sales in direct response  primarily a life operation  also offers health insurance  which is predominantly medicare supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups 
in both and  net health sales were million 
in  net health sales for this group represented approximately of direct response s total life and health net sales 
direct response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year 
health premium rose in to million and in medicare part d 
torchmark  through its subsidiary united american  offers coverage under the government s medicare part d plan 
the medicare part d plan is a stand alone prescription drug plan for medicare beneficiaries 
part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american 
under part d  private carriers are the primary insurers  while cms provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance 
total medicare part d premium was million in  compared with million in  a decline of 
part d premium rose in changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of 
table of contents enrollees 
at december   united american had approximately thousand enrollees for the part d plan  compared with thousand for the plan year and thousand for the plan year 
growth for the plan year was largely a result of a new lower cost part d plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of low income automatic enrollees and to grow our own individual sales 
the new product is priced to achieve the same underwriting margin as our existing product 
our medicare part d product is sold through the direct response operation and to groups through the ua independent agency 
part d net sales were million in  compared with million in and million in we count only sales to new first time enrollees in net sales  and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees 
we believe that the medicare part d program is a meaningful component of our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior age market and with medicare supplements  the government assurances with regard to the risk sharing agreements for participating insurers  limited risk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins  and the renewal of the business every year 
due to our experience with service to the senior age market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system  entry to this business required little new investment 
however  as with any government sponsored program  the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

this risk sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims  and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis 

table of contents annuities 
as described in note discontinued operations  we sold our subsidiary united investors 
united investors was our carrier of variable annuities and a primary carrier of fixed annuities 
as a result of the sale  we disposed of approximately of our annuity deposit balance as of december   including all of our variable annuities 
accordingly  we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward 
our fixed annuity balances at the end of   and  were billion  billion  and million  respectively 
underwriting income was million  million  and thousand in each of the years   and  respectively 
while the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year  policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly 
the stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist primarily of surrender charges and are not based on account size 
these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods 
a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements  which can result in negative net policy obligations 
in each of the years presented  the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities 
furthermore  spreads were increased by the introduction of a new annuity form on liberty national paper in mid the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits 

table of contents administrative expenses 
operating expenses are included in the other and corporate segments and are classified into two categories insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company

in each successive year to in employee costs increased in  primarily as a result of unusually high employee health insurance costs in that year 
partially offsetting the increase in employee costs was a decline in legal costs  as we favorably settled certain previously reserved litigation during in  however  legal expenses returned to normal levels 
expenses for correlated more closely by expense component to expenses  as expenses reflected the aforementioned unusual items 
parent company expense declined in primarily as a result of the decline in certain employee benefit liabilities related to retired employees 
stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of torchmark stock has increased  resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options 
as stated in note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense  and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 
as mentioned in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we incurred two settlement expense issues in that related to events occurring many years ago the settlement of a state administrative issue of million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of million 
in addition to these two items  we recorded two nonrecurring charges 
in  we sold aviation equipment at a loss of thousand and in  we wrote down company occupied real estate that was other than temporarily impaired in the amount of thousand 
while these nonrecurring expenses were included in operating expenses for the respective year in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting guidance  they are considered as non operating expenses by management

it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing our share repurchase program in  we have used over billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment

excess investment income declined million or in from the prior year 
excess investment income rose million or in on a per diluted share basis  excess investment income rose to per share in  after having risen in the prior year 
the favorable increases in the per share amounts relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share purchases 

table of contents the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  which rose to million in it increased to million in from million in presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 
growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost growth in net investment income generally correlates somewhat with the growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost 
with the exception of the years and  growth in investment income has slightly lagged the growth in mean assets for several years 
one of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than the growth in mean invested assets in recent years is due to the low interest rate environment during that period 
as a result  new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of 
another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested 
during these lags  we have held cash at lower yields 
during  because of the uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets  we held significantly more cash and short term investments than in other years 
holding this larger balance of low yielding securities in resulted in the extremely low growth rate in income in that year  and also affected the higher growth rate in as these lower yielding cash balances were invested in the trend of lags in growth in net investment income in relation to the growth in mean invested assets is expected to continue until yields on suitable new investments exceed the portfolio yield 
excess investment income is reduced by required interest on net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt 
information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table 
required interest on net insurance policy liabilities dollar amounts in millions required interest average net insurance policy liabilities average discount rate life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in life and health annuity total increase in the combined average interest discount rate has risen in each of the last three years due to changes in the mix of the in force business 
for more specific information on life and health discount rates  please refer to note future policy benefit reserves in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income 
the table below reconciles interest expense per the consolidated statements of operations to financing costs 
the table below presents the components of financing costs 
analysis of financing costs amounts in thousands interest on funded debt interest on short term debt other interest expense per consolidated statements of operations reclassification of interest due to deconsolidation financing costs see principles of consolidation in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of deconsolidation 
financing costs increased million or in they rose million or in the increase in financing costs in reflects the issuance in june of million principal amount senior notes due in in  we incurred a full year of interest on this issue 
the increase in interest on short term debt was primarily a result of the million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility  arising from the december  restructuring of our credit facility 
more information on this facility is disclosed under the caption short term borrowings in the financial condition section of this report and in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease was due to a decline in short term rates over the previous year  but was also impacted by a decline in the average balance of commercial paper outstanding compared with excess investment income benefits from increases in long term rates available on new investments and decreases in short term borrowing rates 
of these two factors  higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short term rates 
however  growth in our excess investment income decreases when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs  such as we have experienced in recent periods 
in an extended low interest rate environment  the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long term rates 
we believe  however  the decline would be relatively slow  as only to of fixed maturities on average are expected to run off each year over the next five years 
we also believe that the deferred acquisition costs and benefit reserve balances on our life and health business would not be impacted by an extended low interest rate environment 
while these balances for annuities could be affected  the impact would be immaterial 
in response to the lower interest rates  we raised the new business premium rates on certain life products 
the increased premiums will provide additional margin on these policies to help offset the possible future reductions in excess investment income and are not expected to have a detrimental impact on sales 

table of contents investment acquisitions 
torchmark s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives 
we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long term nature of our policy liabilities 
further  we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable 
if such longer term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives  we consider investing in short term securities  taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time 
during calendar years through  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  primarily with longer term maturities as presented in the chart below 
the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases 
the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield 
this date is commonly known as the worst call date 
two different average life calculations are shown  average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date 
fixed maturity acquisitions selected information dollar amounts in millions for the year cost of acquisitions investment grade corporate securities taxable municipal securities other investment grade securities total fixed maturity acquisitions effective annual yield one year compounded average life in years  to next call average life in years to maturity average rating a a a tax equivalent basis  where the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities 
we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a make whole basis prior to maturity  but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so 
for investments in callable bonds  the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date 
given our investments in callable bonds  the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment 
however  the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity 
data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 
the average life of funds invested in to both next call and maturity was lower than that of funds invested during and due to actions taken for statutory capital management purposes and the limited availability of longer term investments 
during the three years through  we have invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds 
purchases in were almost entirely in these corporates 
during and  we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds  primarily build america bonds authorized by the american recovery and retirement act of the investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services 
in assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds  we took into account a number of factors  including the geographic location of the municipalities 
new cash flow available for investment is primarily provided through our insurance operations  but has also been affected by other factors 
issuer calls  as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past three years are a factor 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  
table of contents but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called 
issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in the higher level of acquisitions in was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below 
sales transactions 
during  the company sold million of fixed maturities at amortized cost  including million of below investment grade securities 
the market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where  even though the sales price was less than amortized cost  management determined that better risk adjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities 
other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes 
due in large part to selling below investment grade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investment grade securities  below investment grade securities declined significantly as a percentage of total fixed maturities at year end the reduction in below investment grade securities had a positive impact on the risk based capital position of our insurance subsidiaries at that date and thereafter 
portfolio analysis 
because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms 
the following table presents a comparison of torchmark s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december  with the latest industry data 
torchmark amount in millions industry bonds preferred stock redeemable and perpetual common stocks mortgage loans real estate policy loans other invested assets cash and short terms latest data available from the american council of life insurance as of december  includes redeemable preferred of billion or and perpetual preferred of million or 
at december   approximately of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed maturity portfolio 
policy loans  which are secured by policy cash values  made up an additional 
the remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities  mortgage loans  and other long term and short term investments 

table of contents because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio  the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities 
an analysis of our fixed maturity portfolio by component at december  and december  is as follows fixed maturities by component at december  dollar amounts in millions cost or amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value of total fixed maturities amortized cost fair value corporates redeemable preferred stock municipals government sponsored enterprises governments agencies residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities collateralized debt obligations other asset backed securities total fixed maturities fixed maturities by component at december  dollar amounts in millions cost or amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value of total fixed maturities amortized cost fair value corporates redeemable preferred stock municipals government sponsored enterprises governments agencies residential mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities collateralized debt obligations other asset backed securities total fixed maturities 
table of contents at december   fixed maturities had a fair value of billion  compared with billion at december  at december   fixed maturities were in a million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized gain position of million at december  approximately of our fixed maturity assets at december  at amortized cost were corporate bonds and were redeemable preferred stocks 
this compares with corporate bonds and redeemable preferred stocks at year end on a combined basis  residential mortgage backed securities  other asset backed securities  and collateralized debt obligations cdos were less than of the assets at amortized cost at december  the million of cdos at amortized cost made up less than of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies 
the million of residential mortgage backed securities are rated aaa 
for more information about our fixed maturity portfolio by component at december  and  including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities  see note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the strong and stable cash flows generated by its insurance products  torchmark has the ability to hold securities with temporary unrealized losses until recovery 
even though these fixed maturity investments are available for sale  torchmark generally expects and intends to hold to maturity any securities which are temporarily impaired 
additional information concerning the fixed maturity portfolio is as follows 
fixed maturity portfolio selected information at december  at december  average annual effective yield average life  in years  to next call maturity effective duration to next call  maturity  tax equivalent basis  where the yield on tax exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities 
torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways a based on the next call date which is the next call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for noncallable bonds  and b based on the maturity date of all bonds  whether callable or not 
effective duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to a particular change in interest rates 

table of contents credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk is the level of certainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
approximately of our fixed maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and asset backed securities 
as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
we mitigate this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring only investment grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
we also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors 
the following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at december  fixed maturities by sector at december  dollar amounts in millions cost or amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value of total fixed maturities at amortized cost at fair value financial life health pc insurance financial bank financial other total financial utilities energy government basic materials consumer non cyclical other industrials communications consumer cyclical transportation collateralized debt obligations mortgage backed securities total fixed maturities at december   approximately of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost at fair value were in the financial sector  including in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and in banks at amortized cost 
financial guarantors  mortgage insurers  and insurance brokers comprised approximately of the portfolio 
after financials  the next largest sector was utilities  which comprised of the portfolio at amortized cost 
the balance of the portfolio is spread among issuers in a wide variety of sectors 
as previously noted  gross unrealized losses were million at december   declining from million a year earlier 
the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of million at december  as shown in the table above  the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was approximately for our investments in cdos 
as previously noted  cdos represented less than of our fixed maturity investments at december  we evaluated each of the impaired securities in this and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of the impairments were other than temporary 
our portfolio consisted of five cdo investments at december   in which three were carried at a value of  one was considered only temporarily impaired  and one was previously considered other than temporarily impaired 

table of contents the cdo considered temporarily impaired was carried at an amortized cost of million and had a fair value of million 
the cdo considered other than temporarily impaired was previously written down and carried at an amortized cost of million  based on the present value of expected cash flows at the original purchase yield 
this cdo had a fair value of million at december  the collateral underlying these cdos is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies  and no sub prime or alt a mortgages are included in the collateral 
in reaching these conclusions concerning the other than temporary impairment of our cdos  we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers of each of these cdos the current status of the collateral underlying our investments  the credit events defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral experienced to date  and the possibility of future credit events 
we calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience 
we reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events could have on our expected future cash flows 
we calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate 
while there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations  we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions 
an analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio by a composite rating at december  is shown in the table below 
fixed maturities by rating at december  dollar amounts in millions amortized cost fair value investment grade aaa aa a bbb bbb bbb investment grade below investment grade bb b below b below investment grade the portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of a based on amortized cost 
approximately of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade 
our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower 
we have no direct investments in residential mortgages  nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts 
we do not participate in securities lending 
there are no off balance sheet investments  as all investments are reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have no direct exposure to european sovereign debt 
our current investment policy is to acquire only investment grade obligations 
thus  any increases in below investment grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings 

table of contents an analysis of changes in below investment grade fixed maturities at amortized cost is as follows 
year ended december  in millions balance at january downgrades by rating agencies upgrades by rating agencies disposals amortization balance at december market risk sensitivity 
torchmark s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixed rate investments  the portfolio is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value 
under normal market conditions  we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity 
the long term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points 
market value of fixed maturity portfolio millions change in interest rates in basis points at december  at december  
table of contents realized gains and losses 
our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  we also incur acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
we do not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield  or which result from events that are beyond our control  are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  and as a result  can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period to period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations 
for these reasons  and in line with industry practice  we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 
the following table summarizes our tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of realized gains losses  net of tax dollar amounts in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share investments sales called or tendered writedowns loss on redemption of debt other total written down due to other than temporary impairment 
as described in note investments under the caption other than temporary impairments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year through as a result of other than temporary impairment 
the impaired securities met our criteria for other than temporary impairment as discussed in note and in our critical accounting policies in this report 
the writedowns resulted in pretax charges of thousand in thousand after tax  million in million after tax  and million in million after tax 
the charge included million on cdos million after tax and million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers million after tax 
the remaining writedowns in were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds 
in  we acquired million book value of our senior notes at a cost of million  resulting in an after tax loss on debt redemption of million 

table of contents financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
insurance subsidiary liquidity 
the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs 
sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
the funds to provide for policy benefits  the majority of which are paid in future periods  are invested primarily in long term fixed maturities to meet these long term obligations 
in addition to investment income  maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash 
excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company  subject to regulatory restriction 
the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains 
the leading source of the excess cash is investment income 
however  due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control  a significant portion of the excess cash comes from underwriting income 
parent company liquidity 
cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt  operating expenses of the parent  and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders 
in  the parent received million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries  as compared with million in and million in the dividend included million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of united investors 
after paying debt obligations  shareholder dividends  and other expenses but before share repurchases  torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in of approximately million  including the million from the sale of united investors 
parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes  such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases 
in  it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries  and that approximately million will be available as excess cash flow 
certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 
as additional liquidity  the parent held million of cash and short term investments at december   compared with million a year earlier 
the parent also had available a million receivable from subsidiaries at december  short term borrowings 
an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
as of december   we had available million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility  as compared with million a year earlier 
for detailed information about this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt 

table of contents the following table presents certain information about our short term borrowings  all of which was commercial paper 
short term borrowings commercial paper dollar amounts in millions at december  balance at end of period daily weighted average interest rate letters of credit outstanding remaining amount available under credit line for the year average balance outstanding during period daily weighted average interest rate maximum daily amount outstanding during period annualized there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended december  in summary  torchmark expects to have readily available funds for and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility 
in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed  the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including  but not limited to  the issuance of additional debt  a short term credit facility  and intercompany borrowing 
consolidated liquidity 
consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were million in  compared with billion in  and million in in addition to cash inflows from operations  our companies have received million in investment calls and tenders and million of scheduled maturities or repayments during maturities  tenders  and calls totaled million in and million in our cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end included in cash at december  was the million of proceeds received from the sale of united investors on that date 
additionally  we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  our strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as described in note debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark had outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities at both december  and the capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders 
as described in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the trust preferred shareholders 
the trust is an off balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules  because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest 
while these liabilities are not on our consolidated balance sheets  they are represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trust in the amount of million which is on our balance sheets at both december  and the preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our interest payment on our debt to the trusts 

table of contents as a part of its above mentioned credit facility  torchmark had outstanding million in stand by letters of credit at december  however  these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 
as of december   we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of our guarantees  other than the trust preferred guarantee  were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable debt principal debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations future insurance obligations total funded debt is itemized in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and includes short term commercial paper 
interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
they are offset by invested assets in the trusts  which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due 
therefore  our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations 

table of contents capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  junior subordinated debentures supporting its trust preferred securities  and shareholders equity 
the junior subordinated debentures are payable to torchmark s capital trust iii which is liable for its trust preferred securities 
in accordance with gaap  these instruments are included in due to affiliates on the consolidated balance sheets 
a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
as fully explained in note debt  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due in in june of for proceeds of million 
a portion of these proceeds were used to repay the million due upon the august  maturity of our senior debentures 
in addition  we also used million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes 
the regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by rating agency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios 
the subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investment grade fixed maturities 
our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least of required regulatory capital under risk based capital rbc  a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital 
the target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows  the relatively low risk of their product mix  and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark 
at december   our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 
should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below  management has more than sufficient liquidity at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 
as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report  we reactivated our share repurchase program during the first quarter of we previously had suspended the program indefinitely in march  due to general economic conditions at that time 
however  since reactivation  we have made share purchases each quarter of and under this program  we acquired million shares at a cost of million in average of per share  million shares for million in  and million shares for million in the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 
please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report 
torchmark has recently increased the dividend on its common shares 
in the first quarter of  the dividend was increased from 
per share to 
per share and in the fourth quarter of  it was further increased to 
per share 
in the second quarter of  it was again raised to 
per share 
shareholders equity was billion at december   compared with billion at december  during the twelve months since december   shareholders equity was reduced by the million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises  but has been increased by the million of net income and by after tax unrealized gains of million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved 
we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so 
excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases  acquisitions  increases in shareholder dividends  investment in fixed maturities  or repayment of short term debt 
we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

table of contents we maintain a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities 
current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets 
while invested assets are revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets  with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity 
due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of our shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
from time to time  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders equity 
because of the long term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries  we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity 
as such  we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets 
accordingly  our management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 
the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources 
additionally  the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items  so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark s capital structure

torchmark s debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio 
this ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders equity 
previously  the fasb issued guidance which offered an option which  if elected  would permit us to value our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available for sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income  the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings 
because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt  the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile  causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results 
therefore  we have not elected this option 

table of contents torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was times in  compared with times in and times in this times interest earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre tax income from continuing operations and interest expense 
a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 
credit ratings 
the chart below presents torchmark s credit ratings as of december  standard poor s moody s am best fitch commercial paper a p amb f funded debt a baa a bbb preferred stock bbb baa bbb bbb during the three year period ended december   each of the rating agencies revised the outlook for torchmark from stable to negative and then back to stable 
reasons cited for the negative outlook included increased risk in our investment portfolio  tighter liquidity  and reduced financial flexibility 
reasons cited for the revision back to a stable outlook included improved financial flexibility  increased capital levels at the insurance subsidiaries  the decrease in unrealized losses  and strong operating performance 
the credit quality of torchmark s debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies 
during  a 
m 
best downgraded our preferred stock from bbb to bbb 
also in  fitch downgraded our senior debt from a to bbb two notches  our preferred stock from a to bbb two notches  and our commercial paper from f to f one notch 
fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of torchmark s insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries investment portfolios 
they also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the parent company from the subsidiaries  the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil  and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward 
in january   fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to bbb 
at that time  fitch downgraded over hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities  as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed 
the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is also rated by standard poor s and a 
m 
best 
the following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at december standard poor s am best liberty aa a superior globe aa a superior united american aa a superior american income aa a superior am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to those companies which  in its opinion  have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life health insurance industry 
a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard poor s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the minus sign shows the relative standing within the major rating category 

table of contents other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries 
such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
new unadopted accounting rules the fasb has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to torchmark  effective in future periods policy acquisition costs asu 
this accounting guidance amends the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in order to address the diversity in practice surrounding the capitalization and deferral of these costs 
this guidance will be effective for torchmark beginning january  please refer to unadopted accounting guidance in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the effects of adoption 
comprehensive income asu 
under this guidance  the components of comprehensive income must be presented as either a continuous statement including the components of net income or as two separate but consecutive statements an income statement followed by a comprehensive income statement 
this guidance is effective for us in interim and annual periods beginning in because we already present comprehensive income as contemplated by the second alternative  this guidance should not result in any change 
fair value measurement and disclosure asu 
the primary purpose of this new guidance is to converge the measurement criteria and disclosures of fair value in us gaap with those of international accounting standards 
the measurement principles are generally consistent with current us gaap and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
the guidance will require additional disclosures  including expanded disclosures for fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy and a requirement to disclose the level in the fair value hierarchy of items whose fair value is disclosed but not measured at fair value on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective for us in calendar  with early adoption prohibited 
goodwill impairment testing asu 
the issuance of this update permits an optional qualitative assessment in order to simplify how an entity tests its goodwill for impairment 
under this assessment  if an entity concludes that a reporting units fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount  it would not be required to perform any further impairment testing for that reporting unit 
otherwise  the two step impairment test under current guidance would be required for the reporting unit 
this new guidance lists factors to consider in making the qualitative assessment 
the revised guidance is applicable to us beginning in  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect this new guidance to impact the value of our goodwill  only to modify the way we test for its impairment 
health insurer s fees paid to the federal government asu 
private health insurance carriers will be required to pay a new fee to the federal government beginning in calendar year under the patient protection and affordable care act 
this guidance addresses questions about how to recognize and classify the fees  basically requiring that it be expensed ratably throughout the year 
it is effective for torchmark beginning in the year because the majority of torchmark s health products are excluded from the mandate  the impact of adoption should be immaterial 

table of contents critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in note future policy benefit reserves 
approximately of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december  were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits 
the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue 
these assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts  except where there is a premium deficiency  as defined in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits 
otherwise  variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 
torchmark had no premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december  the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business  where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date 
accordingly  there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 
deferred acquisition costs 
the costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales 
additionally  the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as deferred acquisition costs as indicated in note deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums 
the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue 
these assumptions are locked in at that time and  except where there is a loss recognition issue  are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume 
we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december  the remaining of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits 
these contracts are not subject to lock in 
the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
as noted earlier in this report  our variable annuity block was disposed of as of december  revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december  policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established  and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability 
table of contents for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 
at this time  we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 
valuation of fixed maturities 
we hold a substantial investment in high quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time 
while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity  they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time  primarily to manage risk 
we report this portfolio at fair value 
fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets  having a greater impact on longer term maturities 
because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio  small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company 
this impact is disclosed in basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report 
however  as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report  we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and  as such  we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 
at times  the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets 
illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening  and accordingly unrealized losses  on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable 
even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale  we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products 
considerable information concerning the policies  procedures  classification levels  and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note investments under the caption fair value measurements 
impairment of investments 
we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value  where fair value has declined below carrying value 
while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies and note investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset  at least in part  by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
at december   our gross liability under these funded plans was million  but was offset by assets of million 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans 
while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected 
our discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary
