overview we develop medicines that address the unmet needs and challenges of people living with chronic disease 
a fully integrated global biopharmaceutical company  we apply proven scientific expertise  proprietary technologies and global development capabilities to the creation of innovative treatments for major clinical conditions with a focus on cns disorders  such as schizophrenia  addiction and depression 
we create new  proprietary pharmaceutical products for our own account  and we collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we are increasingly focused on maintaining rights to commercialize our leading product candidates in certain markets 
on september   the business of old alkermes and edt were combined under alkermes 
as part of the business combination  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company merged with and into old alkermes  with old alkermes surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
at the effective time of the business combination  i each share of old alkermes common stock then issued and outstanding and all associated rights were canceled and automatically converted into and became the right to receive one ordinary share of alkermes and ii all issued and outstanding options and stock awards to purchase old alkermes common stock granted under any equity compensation plan were converted into options and stock awards to purchase on substantially the same terms and conditions the same number of alkermes ordinary shares at the same exercise price 
we paid elan million in cash and issued elan million ordinary shares of the company  which had a fair value of approximately million on the closing date  for the edt business 
upon consummation of the business combination  the former shareholders of old alkermes owned approximately of the company  with the remaining approximately of the company owned by a subsidiary of elan 
on march   alkermes plc completed an underwritten public offering of  of the ordinary shares of alkermes plc held by elan 
after completion of the offering  elan  through its subsidiary  owned  of our ordinary shares  equivalent to of the outstanding equity of the company as of march  for a more detailed discussion of the business combination  refer to the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements  including note  the company  and note  acquisitions  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended march  the business combination is being accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations with old alkermes being treated as the accounting acquirer under us gaap  which means that the operating results of old alkermes are included for all periods being presented  whereas the operating results of the acquiree  edt  are included only after the date of acquisition  september   through the end of the period 
executive summary we and our pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners have more than commercialized products sold worldwide  including in the us we earn manufacturing and or royalty revenues on net sales of products commercialized by our partners and earn revenue on net sales of vivitrol  which is a proprietary product that we manufacture  market and sell in the us our five key products are expected to generate significant revenues for us in the near and medium term  as they possess long patent lives  are singular or competitively advantaged products in their class and are generally in the launch phases of their commercial lives 
these five key products are risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  ampyra fampyra  bydureon  and vivitrol 
for the year ended march   we reported million in revenues  which included the revenues generated from products associated with the former edt business  and represented an increase of more than over the year ended march  compared to those for old alkermes 
revenues from our five key products accounted for of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended march  for the year ended march   total expenses increased by million  as compared to the year ended march   due primarily to the addition of edt 
expenses from the edt business were million for the year ended march   and we incurred million during the year ended march  related to the edt acquisition  which consisted primarily of banking  legal and accounting services 
on september   we entered into the term loans with mssf and hsbc 
the million first lien term loan has an initial applicable margin for borrowings of three month libor plus  was issued with an original issue discount of million and has a term of six years 
the million second lien term loan has an initial applicable margin for borrowings of three month libor plus  was issued with an original issue discount of million  and has a term of seven years 
under each of the term loans  libor is subject to an interest rate floor of 
required quarterly principal payments of million on the first lien term loan began during the three months ended march  in addition  beginning in fiscal year  we are required to make principal payments on the first lien term loan for amounts up to of excess cash flows as defined in the first lien term loan credit agreement 
the principal amount of the second lien term loan is due and payable in full on the maturity date 
if prepayments are made prior to september   we may be subject to prepayment premium of of the amount of the term loans being repaid if the prepayment is made in connection with a refinancing transaction or of the amount of the outstanding term loans if the prepayment is made in connection with an amendment to the agreement resulting in a refinancing transaction 
results of operations manufacturing and royalty revenues years ended march  change favorable unfavorable in millions manufacturing and royalty revenues risperdal consta tricor amypra fampyra ritalin la focalin xr invega sustenna xeplion verelan bydureon other manufacturing and royalty revenues manufacturing revenues are earned from the sale of products we manufacture for resale by our collaborative partners 
royalty revenues are earned on our collaborators sales of products that incorporate our technologies 
royalties are generally recognized in the period the products are sold by our collaborators 
under our risperdal consta supply and license agreements with janssen  we earned manufacturing revenues at of janssen s unit net sales price of risperdal consta and royalty revenues at janssen s net sales of risperdal consta in the fiscal years ending march   and the increase in risperdal consta manufacturing and royalty revenues for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase in the number of units shipped to janssen and a increase in royalties 
the increase in royalties was due to an increase in janssen s end market sales of risperdal consta from  million during the year ended march  to  million during the year ended march  the increase in risperdal consta manufacturing and royalty revenues for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a increase in the number of units shipped to janssen and a increase in royalties  partially offset by a decrease in the net unit sales price due to currency fluctuations and a decrease in the net unit sales price due in part to the effect from the us healthcare reform law 
the increase in royalties was due to an increase in janssen s end market sales of risperdal consta from  million during the year ended march  to  million during the year ended march  units sold in countries outside the us by janssen in the years ended march   and accounted for  and of the total units sold  respectively 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information on currency exchange rate risk related to risperdal consta revenues 
we expect revenues from risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  our long acting atypical antipsychotic franchise  to continue to grow  as invega sustenna xeplion is launched around the world 
a number of companies  including us  are working to develop products to treat schizophrenia and or bipolar disorder that may compete with risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion 
increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  as well as increasing pricing pressure 
risperdal consta is covered by a patent until in the eu and in the us  and invega sustenna xeplion is covered by a patent until in the eu and in the us  and as such  we do not anticipate any generic versions in the near term for either of these products 
the increase in royalty revenues from tricor  ampyra fampyra  ritalin la focalin xr  invega sustenna xeplion  verelan and the other manufacturing and royalty revenues were primarily due to the addition of the portfolio of commercialized products from the former edt business on september   which was the closing date of the business combination 
a number of our mature products  including ritalin la and verelan  are currently facing generic competition and tricor and focalin xr will face generic competition in fiscal year as a result  we expect sales of these products to decline over the next few fiscal years 
we expect ampyra fampyra sales to continue to grow as acorda continues to penetrate the us market with ampyra and biogen idec continues to launch fampyra in the rest of the world 
ampyra is covered by a patent until in the us and fampyra is covered by a patent until in the eu  and as such  we do not anticipate any generic versions of these products in the near term 
a number of companies are working to develop products to treat multiple sclerosis that may compete with ampyra fampyra  which may negatively impact future sales of the products 
product sales  net our product sales consist of sales of vivitrol in the us to wholesalers  specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies 
the following table presents the adjustments to arrive at vivitrol product sales  net for sales of vivitrol in the us during the years ended march   and year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  in millions amount of sales amount of sales amount of sales product sales  gross adjustments to product sales  gross medicaid rebates chargebacks wholesaler fees reserve for inventory in the channel other total adjustments product sales  net our reserve for inventory in the channel is an estimate that reflects the deferral of the recognition of revenue on shipments of vivitrol to our customers until the product has left the distribution channel as we do not yet have the history to reasonably estimate returns related to these shipments 
we estimate that product shipments out of the distribution channel through data provided by external sources  including information on inventory levels provided by our customers as well as prescription information 
the increase in product sales  gross for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a increase in the number of units sold into the distribution channel and a increase in price 
the increase in product sales  gross for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a increase in the number of units sold into the distribution channel and a increase in price 
the increases in chargebacks during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  and the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the increase in the price of vivitrol and increased b phs pricing discounts 
the increases in medicaid rebates during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to higher rebates resulting from a price increase in october and the impact of increased medicaid rebate percentage and the extension of medicaid rebates to medicaid managed care organizations 
we expect vivitrol sales to continue to grow as we continue to penetrate the opioid dependence indication market in the us in addition  we anticipate that janssen cilag will increase sales of vivitrol in russia and the cis  which are recorded as manufacturing and royalty revenues  and there exists the potential to launch the product in other countries around the world 
a number of companies  including us  are working to develop products to treat addiction  including alcohol and opioid dependence  that may compete with vivitrol  which may negatively impact future sales of vivitrol 
increased competition may lead to reduced unit sales of vivitrol  as well as increasing pricing pressure 
vivitrol is covered by a patent that will expire in the us in and in europe in and  as such  we do not anticipate any generic versions of this product in the near term 
research and development revenue change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions research and development programs bydureon other research and development revenue r d revenue is generally earned for services performed and milestones achieved under arrangements with our collaborators 
the increase in r d revenue for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to million in bydureon milestone payments we received during the year 
under our agreement with amylin  we received a million milestone payment related to the first commercial sale of bydureon in the eu and a million milestone payment related to the first commercial sale of bydureon in the us during the year ended march   we also received a million milestone payment upon receipt of regulatory approval for vivitrol in russia for the opioid dependence indication 
costs and expenses cost of goods manufactured and sold change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions cost of goods manufactured and sold the increase in cost of goods manufactured and sold in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the addition of million of cost of goods manufactured from the addition of edt s portfolio of commercialized products and a million increase in vivitrol cost of goods manufactured and sold primarily due to an increase in the number of units sold 
the increase in cost of goods manufactured and sold in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a increase in the number of units of risperdal consta shipped to janssen  partially offset by an decrease in the unit cost of risperdal consta 
the decrease in the unit cost of risperdal consta was partially due to a million decrease in costs incurred for scrap 
we expect an increase in cost of goods manufactured and sold in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  as a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations from the former edt business as well as from an increase in production volumes to support higher sales of ampyra fampyra and vivitrol  as well as various other contract manufacturing activities 
research and development expense change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions research and development the increase in r d expense in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the addition of million of r d expense for the former edt business  and an increase in the following expenses from the old alkermes business million in clinical study and laboratory expense  million in professional service expense  and million in employee related expense  partially offset by a million decrease in license and collaboration fees 
the increase in clinical study  laboratory and professional service expense was primarily due to increased activity related to our alks and alks development programs  and the increase in employee related expense is primarily due to an increase in headcount within the old alkermes business and share based compensation expense as recent equity grants were awarded with a higher grant date fair value than older grants 
the decrease in license and collaboration fees was primarily due to a decrease in expense under a collaboration agreement with acceleron pharma  inc acceleron 
the increase in r d expenses for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase of million in internal clinical and preclinical study  laboratory and license and collaboration expenses  a million increase in professional services and a million increase in employee related expenses 
the increase in internal clinical and preclinical study  laboratory and license and collaboration expenses was primarily due to an increase in the number of  and composition of  ongoing clinical and preclinical studies 
the increase in professional services was primarily due to activities related to the approval of vivitrol for opioid dependence  and the increase in employee related expenses was primarily due to an increase in share based compensation expense due to recent equity grants awarded with a higher grant date fair value than older grants  as well as the exclusion of certain prior grants that have vested and are no longer included in share based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by million in savings in depreciation  relocation and occupancy as a result of the relocation of our corporate headquarters from cambridge  massachusetts to waltham  massachusetts in fiscal year we expect a modest increase in r d expense in the year ended march  primarily due to increased r d investment as certain of our key development programs  notably alks  alks and alks continue to advance through the pipeline and due to the inclusion of a full year of operations from the former edt business 
a significant portion of our r d expenses including laboratory supplies  travel  dues and subscriptions  recruiting costs  temporary help costs  consulting costs and allocable costs such as occupancy and depreciation are not tracked by project as they benefit multiple projects or our technologies in general 
expenses incurred to purchase specific services from third parties to support our collaborative r d activities are tracked by project and are reimbursed to us by our partners 
we generally bill our partners under collaborative arrangements using a negotiated full time equivalent fte  or hourly rate 
this rate has been established by us based on our annual budget of employee compensation  employee benefits and the billable non project specific costs mentioned above and is generally increased annually based on increases in the consumer price index 
each collaborative partner is billed using a negotiated fte or hourly rate for the hours worked by our employees on a particular project  plus direct external costs  if any 
we account for our r d expenses on a departmental and functional basis in accordance with our budget and management practices 
selling  general and administrative expense change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a costs for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase of million in professional service expense  million in employee related expenses and million in marketing expense from the old alkermes business  as well as the addition of million of sg a expense for the former edt business 
the increase in professional service was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the business combination 
the increase in employee related expense was primarily due to an increase in headcount and share based compensation expense as recent equity grants were awarded with a higher grant date fair value than older grants  and the increase in marketing expenses was due to an analysis we performed to determine the marketability of our existing products and product candidates 
the increase in sg a expense for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase in employee related expenses of million and marketing expenses of million  partially offset by a reduction in professional services of million 
the increase in employee related expenses was primarily due to an increase in share based compensation as recent equity grants have been awarded with a higher grant date fair value than older grants 
the increase in marketing expenses was primarily due to costs incurred leading up to the launch of vivitrol for opioid dependence  and the decrease in professional services was primarily due to start up costs related to the commercialization of vivitrol for the alcohol indication during the year ended march   that were not incurred during the year ended march  we expect an increase in sg a expense in the year ended march  as a result of the inclusion of a full year of operations from the former edt business 
amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in connection with the business combination  we acquired certain amortizable intangible assets with a fair value of million  which are expected to be amortized over to years 
we amortize our amortizable intangible assets using the economic use method  which reflects the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed as revenue is generated from the underlying patent or contract 
during the year ended march   we had million of amortization expense related to the intangible assets acquired as part of the business combination 
based upon our most recent analysis  amortization of intangible assets included within our consolidated balance sheet at march   is expected to be in the range of approximately million to million annually through fiscal year in connection with the business combination  we acquired ipr d of million  which related to three edt product candidates including megestrol for use in europe at a value of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and after finalization of the purchase accounting for the business combination  we identified events and changes in circumstance  such as correspondence from regulatory authorities and further clinical trial results related to three product candidates  including megestrol for use in europe  acquired as part of the business combination which indicated that the assets may be impaired 
accordingly  we performed an analysis to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we performed the valuation of the ipr d from the viewpoint of a market participant through the use of a discounted cash flow model 
the model contained certain key assumptions including the cost to bring the products through the clinical trial and regulatory approval process  the gross margin a market participant would likely earn if the product were approved for sale  the cost to sell the approved product and a discount factor based on an industry average weighted average cost of capital 
based on the analysis performed  we determined that the ipr d was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets 
we also acquired million of goodwill in connection with the business combination  which is considered an indefinite lived asset and is not amortized  but is subject to an annual review for impairment or when circumstances indicate the fair value may be below its carrying value 
as a result of a qualitative assessment we performed as of october   we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount  and an impairment of our goodwill was not recorded 
other expense income change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other expense  net the increase in interest expense for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to our entry into million of term loan financing in july the million first lien term loan has a principal amount of million and an interest rate of three month libor plus  and the million second lien term loan has a principal amount of million and an interest rate of three month libor plus 
under the term loans  three month libor is subject to an interest rate floor of 
the term loans became effective upon the closing of the business combination in september included in interest expense during the year ended march  are commitment fees of million which were incurred during the period from when we priced the term loans to when the term loans were funded 
we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal year  as fiscal year will include a full year of interest expense on the million principal balance of the term loans 
beyond fiscal year  we anticipate that interest expense will decrease as the term loans are paid down  assuming a consistent libor rate 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the early redemption of our non recourse notes on july  as a result of this transaction  we recorded charges of million relating to the write off of the unamortized portion of deferred financing costs and million primarily related to the premium paid on the redemption of the non recourse notes 
the decrease in interest income during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   due to a lower average balance of cash and investments and lower interest rates earned during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  provision for income taxes change favorable unfavorable years ended march  in millions income tax benefit our income tax benefit for the year ended march  consists of a current income tax provision of million and a deferred income tax benefit of million 
the current income tax provision is primarily due to a provision of million on the taxable transfer of the bydureon intellectual property from the us to ireland the deferred tax benefit is primarily due to a benefit of million from the partial release of the irish deferred tax liability relating to acquired intellectual property that was established in connection with the business combination and a benefit of million due to the partial release of an existing us federal valuation allowance as a consequence of the business combination 
in connection with the business combination  we were incorporated  and are headquartered  in dublin  ireland 
as a result  our statutory tax rate decreased from in the us to in ireland 
the income tax benefit of million for the year ended march  was primarily related to a million current tax benefit for bonus depreciation pursuant to the us small business jobs act of the income tax benefit of million for the year ended march  primarily consisted of a current federal income tax benefit of million and a deferred federal and state tax benefit of million 
the current federal income tax benefit was the result of a carryback of our alternative minimum tax amt nol pursuant to the us worker  homeownership and business act of this law increased the carryback period for certain nols from two years to five years 
prior to the adoption of this law  we had recorded a full valuation allowance against the credits that were established in prior periods when we were subject to amt provisions 
the deferred federal and state tax benefit was due to our recognition of a million income tax expense associated with the increase in the value of certain securities that we carried at fair market value during the year ended march  this income tax expense was recorded in other comprehensive loss income 
as of march   we had million of irish nol carryforwards  million of us federal nol carryforwards  million of state nol carryforwards  and million of other foreign nol and capital loss carryforwards  which either expire on various dates through or can be carried forward indefinitely 
these loss carryforwards are available to reduce certain future irish  us and foreign taxable income  if any 
these loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the appropriate taxing authorities 
these loss carryforwards  which may be utilized in any future period  may be subject to limitations based upon changes in the ownership of our stock 
we have performed a review of ownership changes in accordance with the us internal revenue code and have determined that it is more likely than not that  as a result of the business combination  we have experienced a change of ownership 
as a consequence  our us federal nol carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of million 
liquidity and capital resources our financial condition is summarized as follows in millions march  march  cash and cash equivalents investments short term investments long term total cash  cash equivalents and investments working capital outstanding borrowings current and long term our cash flows for the years ended march   and were as follows years ended march  in millions cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents  end of period the decrease in cash used in operating activities during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  was due to an increase in the amount of cash received from our customers  partially offset by an increase in the amount of cash paid to our employees and suppliers 
both the increase in cash from our customers and cash payments to our suppliers and employees is primarily due to the business combination 
the increase in cash used by investing activities in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the million of cash we paid to acquire edt and a million increase in cash used to acquire property  plant and equipment  partially offset by a million increase in the net sales of investments 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to our entry into the term loans and an increase of million in the amount of cash received related to the issuance of ordinary shares related to our share based arrangements 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to an increase in the amount of cash received from our customers  partially offset by an increase in cash paid to our employees and suppliers and the early redemption of our non recourse notes on july  in addition to a scheduled principal payment of million  we redeemed the balance of our non recourse notes in full in exchange for million  representing of the outstanding principal balance in accordance with the terms of the indenture for the non recourse notes 
we allocated million of the principal payments made during the year ended march  to operating activities to account for the original issue discount on the non recourse notes  and the remaining million of principal payments was allocated to financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to a decrease in the net sales of investments  partially offset by a decrease in property  plant and equipment purchases and our investment in acceleron 
during the year ended march   we moved our corporate headquarters from cambridge  massachusetts  to waltham  massachusetts and increased cash expenditures for property  plant and equipment to furnish and equip our new headquarters 
during the year ended march   we also entered into a collaborative arrangement with acceleron and made an million investment in acceleron 
the increase in cash used in financing activities during the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   was primarily due to the early redemption of our non recourse notes  as discussed above 
at march   our investments consisted of the following gross unrealized amortized cost estimated fair value in millions gains losses investments short term investments long term available for sale investments long term held to maturity total our investment objectives are  first  to preserve liquidity and conservation of capital and  second  to obtain investment income 
our available for sale investments consist primarily of short and long term us government and agency debt securities  debt securities issued by foreign agencies and backed by foreign governments  corporate debt securities and strategic equity investments  which include the common stock of public companies we have or had a collaborative arrangement with 
our held to maturity investments consist of investments that are restricted and held as collateral under certain letters of credit related to certain of our lease agreements 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by past operating activities  payments we have received under r d arrangements and other arrangements with collaborators and private placements of debt securities 
we classify available for sale investments in an unrealized loss position which do not mature within the upcoming months as long term investments 
we have the intent and ability to hold these investments until recovery  which may be at maturity  and it is more likely than not that we would not be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost 
at march   we performed an analysis of our investments with unrealized losses for impairment and determined that they were temporarily impaired 
at march   of our investments were valued using unobservable  or level  inputs to determine fair value as they were not actively trading and fair values could not be derived from quoted market prices 
the illiquidity of our level investments does not have a material impact on our overall liquidity  operations  financial flexibility or stability 
we expect to incur significant additional r d costs and other costs as we expand the development of our proprietary product candidates  including costs related to preclinical studies and clinical trials 
our costs  including r d costs for our product candidates  manufacturing  and sales  marketing and promotional expenses for any current or future products marketed by us or our collaborators  if any  may exceed revenues in the future  which may result in losses from operations 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments  combined with anticipated revenues and anticipated interest income  will generate sufficient cash flows to meet our current anticipated liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect to spend approximately million during the year ended march  for capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures were higher in the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   due to the addition of the former edt business 
our capital expenditures were higher in the year ended march   as compared to the years ended march   due to the relocation of our corporate headquarters from cambridge  massachusetts to waltham  massachusetts  which occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended march  amounts included as construction in progress in the consolidated balance sheets primarily include costs incurred for the expansion of our manufacturing facilities in ohio 
we continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity based on expectations of demand for our products and will continue to record such amounts within construction in progress until such time as the underlying assets are placed into service  or we determine we have sufficient existing capacity and the assets are no longer required  at which time we would recognize an impairment charge 
we continue to periodically evaluate whether facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
borrowings at march   our borrowings consisted of million of term loan financing under the term loans 
please refer to note  long term debt  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our outstanding term loans 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under our current contracts at march  contractual obligations total less than one year fiscal one to three years fiscal three to five years fiscal more than five years after fiscal in thousands term loans principal term loans interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations capital expansion programs total contractual cash obligations as the interest rate on our term loans is based on three month libor  we assumed libor to be  which is the libor rate floor under the term loans for the purposes of this table 
this table excludes any liabilities pertaining to uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
we have million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions at march  and we expect a net reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million due to the expected resolution of certain matters over the next twelve months 
in september  we entered into a license agreement with rpi which granted us exclusive rights to a family of opioid receptor compounds discovered at rpi 
under the terms of the agreement  rpi granted us an exclusive worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications relating to its compounds designed to modulate opioid receptors 
we are responsible for the continued research and development of any resulting product candidates 
we are obligated to pay annual fees of up to million  and tiered royalty payments of between and of annual net sales in the event any products developed under the agreement are commercialized 
in addition  we are obligated to make milestone payments in the aggregate of up to million upon certain agreed upon development events 
all amounts paid to rpi to date under this license agreement have been expensed and are included in r d expense 
in december  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with acceleron which granted us an exclusive license to acceleron s proprietary long acting fc fusion technology platform  called the medifusion tm technology  which is designed to extend the circulating half life of proteins and peptides in exchange for a nonrefundable upfront payment of million and an equity investment in acceleron of million and certain potential milestone payments and royalties 
in addition  we reimburse acceleron for any time  at an agreed upon fte rate  and materials expense acceleron incurs on product development  and we are obligated to make developmental and sales milestone payments in the aggregate of up to million per product in the event that certain development and sales goals are achieved 
we are also obligated to make tiered royalty payments in the mid single digits on annual net sales in the event any products developed under the agreement are commercialized 
since our initial investment in december  we invested an additional million in acceleron 
all amounts paid to acceleron to date under this license and collaboration agreement have been expensed and are included in r d expense  except for our million equity investment which is included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet at march  due to the contingent nature of the payments under the rpi and acceleron arrangements  we cannot predict the amount or period in which royalty  milestone and other payments may be made and accordingly they are not included in the table of contractual maturities 
off balance sheet arrangements at march   we were not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are in the areas of revenue recognition  investments  share based compensation and income taxes 
operating revenues we have entered into a number of collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical companies including janssen for risperdal consta and invega sustenna xeplion  acorda for ampyra fampyra  amylin for bydureon and cilag for the resale of vivitrol in russia and the other countries in the cis 
these collaborative arrangements typically include funding of r d  payments based upon achievement of clinical and pre clinical development milestones  manufacturing services  sales milestones and royalties on product sales 
on april   we adopted new authoritative guidance on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the guidance  which applies to multiple element arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after april   amends the criteria for separating and allocating consideration in a multiple element arrangement by modifying the fair value requirements for revenue recognition and eliminating the use of the residual method 
the fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third party evidence are not available 
deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting provided that i a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
we did not enter into any significant multiple element arrangements or materially modify any of our existing multiple element arrangements during the year ended march  our existing collaboration agreements continue to be accounted for under previously issued revenue recognition guidance for multiple element arrangements  as described below 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a proportional performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method when the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
earned arrangement consideration is typically used as the measure of performance 
the amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total expected payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of earned arrangement consideration to estimated total arrangement consideration to be earned under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the proportional performance method  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the total arrangement consideration to be earned under an arrangement  we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight line basis over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line method  as of the period ending date 
significant management judgment is required in determining the consideration to be earned under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
many of our collaboration agreements entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of performance based milestones 
if the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration  the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration  such as upfront fees and research funding  in our revenue model 
milestones that involve substantial effort on our part and the achievement of which are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration are considered substantive milestones 
on april   we prospectively adopted the accounting guidance related to the milestone method of revenue recognition for r d arrangements 
under the milestone method  contingent consideration received from the achievement of a substantive milestone is recognized in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved  which we believe is more consistent with the substance of our performance under our various collaboration agreements 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved  and iii that would result in additional payments being due to us 
a milestone is substantive if the consideration earned from the achievement of the milestone is consistent with our performance required to achieve the milestone  or the increase in value to the collaboration resulting from our performance  relates solely to our past performance  and is reasonable relative to all of the other deliverables and payments within the arrangement 
our collaboration agreements with our partners provide for payments to us upon the achievement of development milestones  such as the completion of clinical trials or regulatory approval for drug candidates 
as of april   our agreements with partners included potential future payments for development milestones aggregating million 
given the challenges inherent in developing and obtaining approval for pharmaceutical and biologic products  there was substantial uncertainty as to whether any such milestones would be achieved at the time these collaboration agreements were entered into 
in addition  we evaluated whether the development milestones met the remaining criteria to be considered substantive 
as a result of our analysis  we considered million of our development milestones to be substantive and  accordingly  we expect to recognize as revenue future payments received from such milestones as we achieve each milestone 
the election to adopt the milestone method did not impact our historical financial position at april  this policy election may result in revenue recognition patterns for future milestones that are materially different from those recognized for milestones received prior to adoption 
during the year ended march   we recognized into revenue million upon the achievement of developmental milestones and an aggregate of million upon the achievement of milestones existing at april  where there were no remaining performance obligations under the collaborative arrangements 
milestone payments received prior to april  from arrangements where we have continuing performance obligations have been deferred and are recognized through the application of a proportional performance model where the milestone payment is recognized over the related performance period or  in full  when there are no remaining performance obligations 
we make our best estimate of the period of time for the performance period 
we will continue to recognize milestone payments received prior to april  in this manner 
as of march   we have deferred revenue of million from milestone payments received prior to april  that will be recognized through the use of a proportional performance model through amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet short term and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
short term deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the next months 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized within the next months are classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate is based on our current operating plan and  if our operating plan should change in the future  we may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next month period 
the estimate of deferred revenue also reflects management s estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
our performance obligations under these collaborations consist of participation on steering committees  the performance of other r d and manufacturing services 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
at march   we had short term and long term deferred revenue of million and million  respectively  related to our collaborations 
our manufacturing revenues are earned from the sale of products we manufacture for resale by our collaborative partners 
manufacturing revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title to the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain of our manufacturing revenues are recognized based on information supplied to us by our collaborative partners and require estimates to be made 
differences between the actual manufacturing revenues and estimated manufacturing revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
our royalty revenues are related to the sale of products by our collaborative partners that incorporate our technology 
royalties are earned under the terms of a license agreement in the period the products are sold by our collaborative partner  and the royalty earned can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales information is provided to us by our collaborative partners and may require estimates to be made 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
we recognize revenue from product sales of vivitrol when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and title to the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is considered to have occurred when the product has been received by the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell vivitrol to pharmaceutical wholesalers  specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies 
vivitrol product sales are recorded net of sales reserves and allowances 
sales of many pharmaceutical products in the us are subject to increased pricing pressure from managed care groups  institutions  government agencies and other groups seeking discounts 
we and other biotechnology companies selling products in the us market are required to provide statutorily defined rebates and discounts to various us government agencies in order to participate in the medicaid program and other government funded programs 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
estimates associated with medicaid and other us government allowances may become subject to adjustment in a subsequent period 
we record vivitrol product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances medicaid rebates we record accruals for rebates to states under the medicaid drug rebate program as a reduction of sales when the product is shipped into the distribution channel 
we rebate individual states for all eligible units purchased under the medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation  which is based on our average manufacturer price amp 
we estimate expected unit sales and rebates per unit under the medicaid program and adjust our rebate estimates based on actual unit sales and rebates per unit 
to date  actual medicaid rebates have not differed materially from our estimates  chargebacks wholesaler and specialty pharmacy chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which consist primarily of federal government agencies purchasing under the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on actual and expected utilization of these programs 
wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates  wholesaler fees cash consideration  including sales incentives  given by us under distribution service agreements with a number of wholesaler  distributor and specialty pharmacy customers that provide them with the opportunity to earn discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services  inventory in the channel we defer the recognition of revenue on shipments of vivitrol to our customers until the product has left the distribution channel 
we estimate product shipments out of the distribution channel through data provided by external sources  including information on inventory levels provided by our customers in the distribution channel  as well as prescription information 
in order to match the cost of goods related to products shipped to customers with the associated revenue  we defer the recognition of the cost of goods to the period in which the associated revenue is recognized

in addition  we hold strategic equity investments  which include the common stock of public companies we have or had a collaborative arrangement with 
substantially all of our investments are classified as available for sale and are recorded at their estimated fair value 
the valuation of our available for sale securities for purposes of determining the amount of gains and losses is based on the specific identification method 
our held to maturity investments are restricted investments held as collateral under certain letters of credit related to our lease arrangements and are recorded at amortized cost 
the earnings on our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates  credit ratings  collateral value  the overall strength of credit markets and other factors that may result in other than temporary declines in the value of the securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review the fair market value of our investments in comparison to amortized cost 
if the fair market value of a security is less than its carrying value  we perform an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline and the financial condition of the issuer 
we then consider our intent and ability to hold the equity security for a period of time sufficient to recover our carrying value 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
we classify our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs are based on a market approach using quoted prices obtained from brokers or dealers for similar securities or for securities for which we have limited visibility into their trading volumes 
valuations of these financial instruments do not require a significant degree of judgment 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset 
our level investments are valued using discounted cash flow models that include assumptions such as estimates for interest rates  the timing of cash flows  expected holding periods and risk adjusted discount rates  which include provisions for default and liquidity risk 
we also consider assumptions market participants would use in their estimate of fair value  such as collateral underlying the securities  the creditworthiness of the issuers  associated guarantees  bid and ask prices and callability features 
while we believe the valuation methodologies are appropriate  the use of valuation methodologies is highly judgmental and changes in methodologies can have a material impact on our results of operations 
share based compensation in connection with valuing stock options  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to estimate certain subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected option term  which takes into account both the contractual term of the option and the effect of our employees expected exercise and post vesting termination behavior  expected volatility of our ordinary shares over the option s expected term  which is developed using both the historical volatility of our ordinary shares and implied volatility from our publicly traded options  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term  and an expected annual dividend yield 
due to the differing exercise and post vesting termination behavior of our employees and non employee directors  we establish separate black scholes input assumptions for three distinct employee populations our senior management  our non employee directors  and all other employees 
for the year ended march   the ranges in weighted average assumptions were as follows expected option term years expected stock volatility risk free interest rate expected annual dividend yield in addition to the above  we apply judgment in developing estimates of award forfeitures 
for the year ended march   we used an estimated forfeiture rate of zero for our non employee directors  for members of senior management and for all other employees 
for all of the assumptions used in valuing stock options and estimating award forfeitures  our historical experience is generally the starting point for developing our assumptions  which may be modified to reflect information available at the time of grant that would indicate that the future is reasonably expected to differ from the past 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we determine impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
the estimated future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
included in our impairment assessment is a review of goodwill 
in connection with the acquisition of edt  we recorded goodwill of million  which represented the excess cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition 
our goodwill balance solely relates to the edt acquisition in fiscal year we assess our goodwill balance within our single reporting unit annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable to determine whether any impairment in this asset may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
in performing our annual goodwill impairment assessment  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if we believe  as a result of our qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
if  based on our qualitative assessment  we are required to proceed to the quantitative assessment  we first compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of our reporting unit  then the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then the company records an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we performed our required annual goodwill impairment assessment during the third quarter of fiscal year our amortizable intangible assets include technology and collaborative arrangements that were acquired as part of the business combination 
these intangible assets are being amortized as revenue is generated from these products  which we refer to as the economic benefit amortization model 
this amortization methodology involves calculating a ratio of actual current period sales to total anticipated sales for the life of the product and applying this ratio to the carrying amount of the intangible asset 
an analysis of the anticipated product sales generated from our amortizable intangible assets is performed at least annually during our planning cycle  and this analysis serves as the basis for the calculation of our economic benefit amortization model 
this analysis is based upon certain assumptions that we evaluate on a periodic basis  such as the anticipated product sales and expected impact of competitor products and our own pipeline product candidates  as well as the issuance of new patents or the extension of existing patents 
although we believe this process allows us to reliably determine the best estimate of the pattern in which we will consume the economic benefits of our amortizable intangible assets  the model could result in deferring amortization charges to future periods in certain instances  due to continued sales of a product at a nominal level after patent expiration or otherwise 
our initial model was completed as part of the business combination and based upon this analysis  amortization of our amortizable intangible assets is expected to be in the range of approximately million to million annually through fiscal year we monitor events and expectations regarding product performance 
if there are any indications that the assumptions underlying our most recent analysis would be different than those utilized within our current estimates  our analysis would be updated and may result in a significant change in the anticipated lifetime revenue of the products associated with our amortizable intangible assets 
for example  the occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense associated with our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations  which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations 
we review amounts capitalized as ipr d for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets might not be recoverable 
in the event the carrying value of the assets are not expected to be recovered  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and after finalization of the purchase accounting for the business combination  we identified events and changes in circumstance  such as correspondence from regulatory authorities and further clinical trial results related to three product candidates  including megestrol for use in europe  acquired as part of the business combination which indicated that the assets may be impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million within amortization and impairment of acquired intangible assets in the accompanying statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
valuation of intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of collaboration agreements  technology associated with human therapeutic products and ipr d product candidates that we acquired as part of the business combination 
when significant identifiable intangible assets are acquired  we engage an independent third party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of these assets as of the acquisition date 
discounted cash flow models are typically used in these valuations  which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to estimating the timing of and expected costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates and probability rates by project 
we believe the fair values assigned to the intangible assets acquired are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
if these projects are not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company may be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of the acquired intangible assets may become impaired 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr d analysis were reasonable at the time of the respective acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected product sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such products  will transpire as estimated 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
our most significant tax jurisdictions are the irish and us federal governments and states 
significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes 
some of these estimates are based on management s interpretations of jurisdiction specific tax laws or regulations and the likelihood of settlement related to tax audit issues 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective income tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  changes in estimates of prior years items  likelihood of settlement  and changes in overall levels of income before taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative income in the most recent fiscal years  changes in the business in which we operate and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
at march   we determined  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  that it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized  and a valuation allowance has been recorded 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for uncertain tax positions can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements in our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we hold securities in our investment portfolio that are sensitive to market risks 
our securities with fixed interest rates may have their market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to a fall in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because we classify our investments in debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
should interest rates fluctuate by  our interest income would change by approximately million over an annual period 
due to the conservative nature of our short term and long term investments and our investment policy  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk as our investment policies specify credit quality standards for our investments and limit the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
we do not believe that inflation and changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations  and as over of our investments are in debt securities issued by the us government and or agencies of developed countries  our exposure to liquidity and credit risk is not believed to be significant 
in september  we and certain of our subsidiaries  as guarantors  entered into the term loans with mssf as administrative agent and as collateral agent  mssf and hsbc as co syndication agents  joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners  and various other financial institutions  as lenders 
the initial applicable margin for borrowings under the first lien term loan is three month libor plus and three month libor plus under the second lien term loan 
under each of the term loans  libor is subject to an interest rate floor of 
commencing with completion of our first fiscal quarter ending after the business combination  the applicable margin under the first lien term loan is subject to adjustment each fiscal quarter  based upon meeting a certain consolidated leverage ratio during the preceding quarter 
the applicable margin under the second lien term loan is not subject to adjustment 
in accordance with the terms of the term loans  we entered into two interest rate cap agreements and an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate the interest rate risk on million principal amount of the term loans 
one interest rate cap  with a notional amount of million protects us if three month libor were to reach from the date of issuance through december  the second interest rate cap  with a notional amount of million protects us if three month libor were to reach from the date of issuance through december  the interest rate swap protects us if three month libor were to reach from december  through september  as the three month libor rate was at march   the libor floor under the agreement is  and as our interest rate cap fixes our interest rate at for million principal amount and for million principal amount of our term loans  we do not expect changes in the three month libor to have a material effect on our financial statements through march  we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
the counterparties to our interest rate cap and interest rate swap contracts are multinational commercial banks 
we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is remote 
currency exchange rate risk the manufacturing and royalty revenues we receive on risperdal consta  fampyra  invega sustenna  tricore and ritalin la are a percentage of the net sales made by our collaborative partners 
a significant portion of these sales are made in countries outside the us and are denominated in currencies in which the product is sold  which is predominantly the euro 
the manufacturing and royalty payments on these non us sales are calculated initially in the currency in which the sale is made and is then converted into usd to determine the amount that our partners pay us for manufacturing and royalty revenues 
fluctuations in the exchange ratio of the usd and these non us currencies will have the effect of increasing or decreasing our manufacturing and royalty revenues even if there is a constant amount of sales in non us currencies 
for example  if the usd weakens against a non us currency  then our manufacturing and royalty revenues will increase given a constant amount of sales in such non us currency 
for the year ended march   an average strengthening of the usd relative to the currencies in which these products are sold would have resulted in our manufacturing and royalty revenues being reduced by approximately million 
for the year ended march   an average strengthening of the usd relative to the currencies in which risperdal consta are sold would have resulted in our manufacturing and royalty revenues being reduced by approximately million 
as a result of the business combination  we incur substantial operating costs in ireland 
we face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the usd and the euro arising from expenses and payables at our irish operations that are settled in euro 
the impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the usd and the euro on our usd denominated manufacturing and royalty revenues earned in countries other than the us is partially offset by the opposite impact of changes in the exchange ratio of the usd and the euro on operating expenses and payables incurred at our irish operations that are settled in euro 
for the fiscal year ended march   an average weakening in the usd relative to the euro would have resulted in an increase to our expenses denominated in euro of million
