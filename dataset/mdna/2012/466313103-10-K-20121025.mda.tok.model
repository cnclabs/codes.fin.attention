table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the leading providers of worldwide electronic manufacturing services and solutions 
we provide comprehensive electronics design  production and product management services to companies in the aerospace  automotive  computing  consumer  defense  industrial  instrumentation  medical  networking  peripherals  solar  storage and telecommunications industries 
the industry in which we operate is composed of companies that provide a range of manufacturing  design and aftermarket services to companies that utilize electronics components 
the industry experienced rapid change and growth through the s as an increasing number of companies chose to outsource an increasing portion  and  in some cases  all of their manufacturing requirements 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined as a result of significant cut backs in customer production requirements  which was consistent with the overall downturn in the technology sector at the time 
in response to this downturn in the technology sector  we implemented restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
industry revenues generally began to stabilize in and companies began to turn more to outsourcing versus internal manufacturing 
in addition  the number of industries serviced  as well as the market penetration in certain industries  by electronic manufacturing service providers has increased over the past several years 
in mid  the industry s revenue declined when a deteriorating macro economic environment resulted in illiquidity in the overall credit markets and a significant economic downturn in the north american  european and asian markets 
in response to this downturn  we implemented additional restructuring programs to reduce our cost structure and further align our manufacturing capacity with the geographic production demands of our customers 
uncertainty remains regarding the extent and timing of the current economic recovery  particularly in those countries such as those in much of europe where economic conditions have recently regressed 
we will continue to monitor the current economic environment and its potential impact on both the customers that we serve as well as our end markets and closely manage our costs and capital resources so that we can respond appropriately as circumstances continue to change 
we manage our business and operations in the following three segments diversified manufacturing services dms  enterprise infrastructure e i and high velocity systems hvs 
our dms segment is composed of dedicated resources to manage higher complexity global products in regulated industries and bring materials and process technologies including design and aftermarket services to our global customers 
our e i and hvs segments offer integrated global supply chain solutions designed to provide cost effective solutions for our customers 
our e i segment is focused on our customers primarily in the computing  storage  networking and telecommunication sectors 
our hvs segment is focused on the particular needs of the consumer products industry  including mobility  display  set top boxes and peripheral products such as printers and point of sale terminals 
we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 

table of contents our cost of revenue includes the cost of electronic components and other materials that comprise the products we manufacture  the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead  and adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
as a provider of turnkey manufacturing services  we are responsible for procuring components and other materials 
this requires us to commit significant working capital to our operations and to manage the purchasing  receiving  inspection and stocking of materials 
although we bear the risk of fluctuations in the cost of materials and excess scrap  we periodically negotiate cost of materials adjustments with our customers 
net revenue from each product that we manufacture consists of an element based on the costs of materials in that product and an element based on the labor and manufacturing overhead costs allocated to that product 
we refer to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on materials costs as material based revenue  and to the portion of the sales price of a product that is based on labor and manufacturing overhead costs as manufacturing based revenue 
our gross margin for any product depends on the mix between the cost of materials in the product and the cost of labor and manufacturing overhead allocated to the product 
we typically realize higher gross margins on manufacturing based revenue than we do on materials based revenue 
as we gain experience in manufacturing a product  we usually achieve increased efficiencies  which result in lower labor and manufacturing overhead costs for that product 
our operating results are impacted by the level of capacity utilization of manufacturing facilities  indirect labor costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high production volume and high capacity utilization 
during periods of low production volume  we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating income margins 
we have consistently utilized advanced circuit design  production design and manufacturing technologies to meet the needs of our customers 
to support this effort  our engineering staff focuses on developing and refining design and manufacturing technologies to meet specific needs of specific customers 
most of the expenses associated with these customer specific efforts are reflected in our cost of revenue 
in addition  our engineers engage in r d of new technologies that apply generally to our operations 
the expenses of these r d activities are reflected in the research and development line item within our consolidated statement of operations 
an important element of our strategy is the expansion of our global production facilities 
the majority of our revenue and materials costs worldwide are denominated in us dollars  while our labor and utility costs in operations outside the us are denominated in local currencies 
we economically hedge these local currency costs  based on our evaluation of the potential exposure as compared to the cost of the hedge  through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts 
changes in the fair market value of such hedging instruments are reflected within the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
see risk factors we are subject to risks of currency fluctuations and related hedging operations 
we currently depend  and expect to continue to depend  upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue and upon their growth  viability and financial stability 
a significant reduction in sales to any of our customers or a customer exerting significant pricing and margin pressures on us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past  some of our customers have terminated their manufacturing arrangements with us or have significantly reduced or delayed the volume of design  production or product management services ordered from us  including moving a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
there can be no assurance that present or future customers will not terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us or significantly reduce or delay the volume of design  production or product management services ordered from us  or move a portion of their manufacturing from us in order to more fully utilize their excess internal manufacturing capacity 
any such termination of a manufacturing relationship or change  reduction or delay in orders could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
see risk factors because we depend on a limited number of customers  a reduction in sales to any one of our customers could cause a significant decline in our revenue  risk factors most of our customers do not commit to long term production schedules  which makes it difficult for us to schedule production and capital expenditures  and to maximize the efficiency of our manufacturing capacity  risk factors our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities  delay production or change their sourcing strategy and note concentration of risk and segment data to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of results net revenues for fiscal year increased approximately to billion compared to billion for fiscal year largely due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  including new program wins with these customers 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ended august  certain key operating results and other financial information in thousands  except per share data 
fiscal year ended august  net revenue gross profit operating income net income attributable to jabil circuit  inc income per share basic income per share diluted 
table of contents key performance indicators management regularly reviews financial and non financial performance indicators to assess the company s operating results 
the following table sets forth  for the quarterly periods indicated  certain of management s key financial performance indicators 
three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns annualized turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days three months ended august  may  february  november  sales cycle days days days days inventory turns annualized turns turns turns turns days in accounts receivable days days days days days in inventory days days days days days in accounts payable days days days days the sales cycle is calculated as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory  less the days in accounts payable  accordingly  the variance in the sales cycle quarter over quarter is a direct result of changes in these indicators 
during the three months ended august   days in accounts receivable decreased one day to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter 
during the three months ended may   days in accounts receivable remained constant at days as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended february   days in accounts receivable increased one day to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely as a result of the timing of sales and cash collection efforts during the quarter 
during the three months ended november   days in accounts receivable remained constant at days as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended august   days in inventory decreased four days to days  as compared to the prior sequential quarter due to continued focus on inventory management and increased sales activity during the quarter 
additionally  inventory decreased as some of the previously increased levels of inventory to support the transition of certain program wins have declined as the programs have been transitioned 
during the three months ended may   days in inventory increased one day to days  as compared to the prior sequential quarter  largely due to increased levels of inventory to support the transition of certain program wins 
during the three months ended february   days in inventory remained constant at days as compared to the prior sequential quarter 
during the three months ended november   days in inventory increased three days to days as compared to the prior sequential quarter largely due to increased levels of inventory to support the transition of certain program wins and higher revenue levels 
inventory turns  on an annualized basis  remained constant at seven turns during each quarter of fiscal year during the three months ended august   may   february  and november   days in accounts payable remained constant at days  increased four days to days  decreased seven days to days and increased four days to days  respectively  from the prior sequential quarter primarily due to the timing of purchases and cash payments for purchases during the respective quarters 
the sales cycle was days during the three months ended august   days during the three months ended may   days during the three months ended february  and days during the three months ended november  the changes in the sales cycle are due to the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and inventory that are discussed above 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and 
table of contents related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from manufacturing services related to electronic equipment built to customer specifications 
we also derive revenue to a lesser extent from aftermarket services  design services and excess inventory sales 
revenue from manufacturing services and excess inventory sales is generally recognized  net of estimated product return costs  when goods are shipped  title and risk of ownership have passed  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
aftermarket service related revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
design service related revenue is generally recognized upon completion and acceptance by the respective customer 
we assume no significant obligations after product shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to receivables not expected to be collected from our customers 
this allowance is based on management s assessment of specific customer balances  considering the age of receivables and financial stability of the customer 
if there is an adverse change in the financial condition and circumstances of our customers  or if actual defaults are higher than provided for  an addition to the allowance may be necessary 
inventory valuation we purchase inventory based on forecasted demand and record inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly assesses inventory valuation based on current and forecasted usage  customer inventory related contractual obligations and other lower of cost or market considerations 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional valuation adjustments may be necessary 
long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of property  plant and equipment is measured by comparing its carrying value to the undiscounted projected cash flows that the asset s or asset group s are expected to generate 
if the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group over its respective fair value  which is generally determined as either the present value of estimated future cash flows or the appraised value 
the impairment analysis is based on significant assumptions of future results made by management  including revenue and cash flow projections 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of property  plant and equipment include unforeseen decreases in future performance or industry demand and the restructuring of our operations resulting from a change in our business strategy or adverse economic conditions 
for further discussion of our current restructuring program  refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations restructuring and impairment charges 
we have recorded intangible assets  including goodwill  in connection with business acquisitions 
estimated useful lives of amortizable intangible assets are determined by management based on an assessment of the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flows 
the fair value of acquired amortizable intangible assets impacts the amounts recorded as goodwill 
we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using the two step method on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on an average weighting of both projected discounted future results and the use of comparative market multiples 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired and a second test is performed to measure the amount of loss  if any 
we perform an indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount to the fair value 
we determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets principally based on a variation of the income approach  known as the relief from royalty methodology 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  the indefinite lived intangible asset is considered impaired 

table of contents we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the fair values of our reporting units and the indefinite lived intangible assets are substantially in excess of the carrying values and that no impairment existed as of the date of the impairment test 
retirement benefits we have pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities in certain foreign locations that are developed from actuarial valuations 
actuarial valuations require management to make certain judgments and estimates of discount rates  compensation rate increases and return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions on a regular basis taking into consideration current market conditions and historical market data 
the discount rate is used to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
this rate represents the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
when considering the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we take into account current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
other assumptions include demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefits  refer to note postretirement and other employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
the internal revenue service irs completed its field examination of our tax returns for the fiscal years through and issued a revenue agent s report rar on april  proposing adjustments primarily related to the irs contentions that certain corporate expenses relate to services provided to foreign affiliates and therefore must be charged to those affiliates  and valuable intangible property was transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge 
if the irs ultimately prevails in its positions  our income tax payment due for the fiscal years through would be approximately an additional million before utilization of any tax attributes arising in periods subsequent to fiscal year also  the irs has proposed interest and penalties with respect to fiscal years through the irs also completed its field examination for fiscal years through and issued a rar on april  the proposed adjustments primarily related to the carryforward impact of the adjustments proposed by the irs for fiscal years through related to valuable intangible property transferred to certain foreign affiliates without charge in prior years 
due to the utilization of tax attributes  including net operating loss nol carryforwards and nol carrybacks  there is no proposed additional tax payment  interest  or penalties contained in the rar with respect to fiscal years through in addition  the irs will likely make similar claims in future audits with respect to these types of transactions at this time  determination of the additional income tax due for these later years is not practicable 
we also anticipate that the irs may seek to impose interest and penalties in subsequent years with respect to the same types of issues 
we disagree with the proposed adjustments and are vigorously contesting this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
as the final resolution of the proposed adjustments remains uncertain  we continue to provide for the uncertain tax position based on the more likely than not standards 
while the resolution of the issues may result in tax liabilities  interest and penalties  which are significantly higher than the amounts provided for this matter  management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
despite this belief  an unfavorable resolution  particularly if the irs successfully asserts similar claims for later years  could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition particularly during the quarter in which any adjustment is recorded or any tax is due or paid

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of net revenue fiscal year ended august  net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development amortization of intangibles restructuring and impairment charges settlement of receivables and related charges loss on disposal of subsidiaries operating income other expense interest income interest expense income before income tax income tax expense net income net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  net of income tax expense net income attributable to jabil circuit  inc fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  net revenue 
our net revenue increased to billion for fiscal year  up from billion in fiscal year specific increases include a increase in the sale of specialized services products  a increase in the sale of instrumentation and healthcare products and a increase in the sale of industrial and clean tech products 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the sale of hvs products and a decrease in the sale of e i products 
the increases are primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  most notably in dms  including new program wins with these customers 
the decreases in e i and hvs revenues are primarily due to a decline in the end market demand for certain customer products in these segments  partially offset by an increase in the sale of printer and storage products due to new program wins 
generally  we assess revenue on a global customer basis regardless of whether the growth is associated with organic growth or as a result of an acquisition 
accordingly  we do not differentiate or report separately revenue increases generated by acquisitions as opposed to existing business 
in addition  the added cost structures associated with our acquisitions have historically been relatively insignificant when compared to our overall cost structure 
the distribution of revenue across our sectors has fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of numerous factors  including but not limited to the following fluctuations in customer demand as a result of recessionary conditions  efforts to de emphasize the economic performance of certain sectors  most specifically  our former automotive and display sectors  seasonality in our business  and business growth from new and existing customers 
on september   we reorganized our business into the following three segments dms  e i and hvs 
in conjunction with this reorganization  there have been certain reclassifications made within the reported sectors for the fiscal year ended august

gross profit 
gross profit remained constant at billion of net revenue for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of net revenue for fiscal year compared to million of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years and is due to additional salary and salary related expenses associated with increased headcount to support the continued growth of our business and additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with acquisitions  including f i holding company which directly or indirectly wholly owns certain french and italian operations during the second quarter of fiscal year and telmar network technology  inc telmar during the second quarter of fiscal year research and development 
research and development r d expenses for fiscal year remained relatively constant at million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august   partially offset by an increase to amortization expense associated with the definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of telmar

during the second quarter of fiscal year  immediately prior to the acquisition of the competence sites  we recognized a charge of million in order to record million in receivables and other relationships with the competence sites at their respective fair values 
in addition  we recognized acquisition costs and other related charges of million during the second quarter of fiscal year refer to note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
we recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal year other expense 
other expense increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to an incremental loss of million recognized during fiscal year under the foreign asset backed securitization program  largely due to such expense being recorded to interest expense during a portion of the comparable period as the program was accounted for as a secured borrowing until may  and million of expense 
table of contents recognized during the fiscal year related to fair value adjustments associated with customer warrants 
refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the foreign asset backed securitization program 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year the decrease during these periods was primarily due to reduced cash investments 
interest expense 
we recorded million of interest expense in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased borrowings associated with our five year unsecured credit facility amended as of december  the old amended and restated credit facility which was further amended and restated on march  by the amended and restated credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by the losses recognized in connection with the asset backed securitization programs that were recorded to interest expense during the fiscal year ended august  because the asset backed securitization programs were accounted for as secured borrowings for a portion of the period 
refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the asset backed securitization programs 
income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased from the previous period primarily due to the mix of tax rates and the expiration of tax incentives in various jurisdictions in which we do business  partially offset by the release of tax reserves related to the settlement of a non us governmental tax audit in fiscal year and no tax benefit related to the acquisition losses of f i holding company in fiscal year most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  due to lower statutory tax rates and tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  singapore and vietnam 
the hungarian incentive and the majority of the chinese incentives expired during fiscal year the remaining material tax incentives expire at various dates through such tax incentives are subject to conditions with which we expect to continue to comply

gross profit 
gross profit increased to billion of net revenue for fiscal year from billion of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in gross profit on an absolute basis and as a percentage of net revenue from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased revenue from certain of our existing customers  including new program wins with these customers  which allow us to better utilize capacity and absorb fixed costs  an increased focus on controlling costs and improving productivity and additional growth in the dms segment  which typically has higher margins than the e i and hvs segments 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at million of net revenue for fiscal year compared to million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue between fiscal years and is due to an increased focus on controlling costs  as well as being able to better absorb fixed costs as revenue levels increase 
research and development 
r d expenses for fiscal year decreased to million of net revenue from million of net revenue for fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a greater portion of engineering resources working on customer funded design projects and r d activity being moved to our design centers in lower cost geographies 
amortization of intangibles 
we recorded million of amortization of intangibles in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized since august  for additional information regarding purchased intangibles  see acquisitions and expansion below  note f description of business and summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements

loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
we recorded a loss on disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold the operations of jabil circuit automotive  sas  an automotive electronic manufacturing subsidiary located in western europe to an unrelated third party 
in connection with this sale  we recorded a loss on disposition of approximately million  which includes approximately million in transaction costs incurred in connection with the sale during the three months ended november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we sold f i holding company  which directly or indirectly wholly owns the competence sites  to an unrelated third party 
in connection with this transaction  we provided an aggregate million working capital loan to the disposed operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the consolidated statement of operations  including million of transaction related costs and million in order to record the working capital loan at its respective fair market value at august  based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to loss on disposal of subsidiaries within the consolidated statement of operations  including million to fully write off the remaining balance of the working capital loan and million to write off a purchase price related receivable that we were due from the third party purchaser as they were deemed no longer collectible

interest income 
interest income remained relatively constant at million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year interest expense 
we recorded million of interest expense in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to interest associated with the issuance of our senior notes during the first quarter of fiscal year and the refinancing of the credit facility dated as of july  the old credit facility at market rates  which were higher than the old credit facility s  during the second quarter of fiscal year income tax expense 
income tax expense reflects an effective tax rate of for fiscal year  as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year the effective tax rate differs from the previous period due to the amount of earnings  mix of tax rates  and increase in tax incentives in the various jurisdictions in which we do business and the sale of f i holding company which owns the competence sites in fiscal year  partially offset by the acquisition of f i holding company in fiscal year most of our international operations have historically been taxed at a lower rate than in the us  primarily due to tax incentives granted to our sites in brazil  china  hungary  malaysia  poland  singapore and vietnam

non us gaap core financial measures the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include certain non us gaap financial measures as identified in the reconciliation below 
the non us gaap financial measures disclosed herein do not have standard meaning and may vary from the non us gaap financial measures used by other companies or how we may calculate those measures in other instances from time to time 
non us gaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap 
also  our core financial measures should not be construed as an inference by us that our future results will be unaffected by those items which are excluded from our core financial measures 
management believes that the non us gaap core financial measures set forth below are useful to facilitate evaluating the past and future performance of our ongoing manufacturing operations over multiple periods on a comparable basis by excluding the effects of the amortization of intangibles  distressed customer charges  stock based compensation expense and related charges  restructuring and impairment charges  settlement of receivables and related charges and loss on disposal of subsidiaries 
among other uses  management uses non us gaap core financial measures as a factor in determining certain employee performance when determining incentive compensation 
we are reporting core operating income and core earnings to provide investors with an additional method for assessing operating income and earnings  by presenting what we believe are our core manufacturing operations 
a significant portion based on the respective values of the items that are excluded for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings also impacted certain balance sheet assets  resulting in a portion of an asset being written off without a corresponding recovery of cash we may have previously spent with respect to the asset 
in the case of restructuring charges  we may be making associated cash payments in the future 
in addition  although  for purposes of calculating core operating income and core earnings  we exclude stock based compensation expense which we anticipate continuing to incur in the future because it is a non cash expense  the associated stock issued may result in an increase in our outstanding shares of stock  which may result in the dilution of our stockholders ownership interest 
we encourage you to evaluate these items and the limitations for purposes of analysis in excluding them

table of contents acquisitions and expansion as discussed in note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements  we completed our acquisition of telmar during the second quarter of fiscal year acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting 
our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of each business from the date of acquisition 
see risk factors we have on occasion not achieved  and may not in the future achieve  expected profitability from our acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at august   we had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling billion  total notes payable and long term debt of billion  billion in available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities and up to million in available liquidity under our trade accounts receivable securitization and uncommitted sale programs 
as the sale programs are uncommitted  we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity  including our revolving credit facilities 
cash flows the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years ended august selected consolidated cash flow information in thousands fiscal year ended august  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year was approximately million 
this resulted primarily from net income of million  million in non cash depreciation and amortization expense and million in stock based compensation expense  which were partially offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million increase in inventories 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily driven by increases in the deferred purchase price notes receivable under our asset backed securitization programs due to higher levels of sales and the timing of cash funding provided by the unaffiliated conduits and financial institutions discussed further below and advanced deposits made for machinery and equipment purchases and facility expansion primarily within our dms segment 
the increase in inventories was primarily to support the transition of certain program wins 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal year was million 
this consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million principally for machinery and equipment for new business  particularly within our dms segment  maintenance levels of machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure upgrades and million of net cash paid to acquire telmar 
these increases were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million 
this resulted from our receipt of approximately billion of proceeds from borrowings under the senior notes and billion of proceeds from borrowings under existing debt agreements  which primarily included billion of borrowings under the old amended and restated credit facility and the amended and restated credit facility 
this was offset by repayments in an aggregate amount of approximately billion during fiscal year  which primarily included an aggregate of billion of repayments under the old amended and restated credit facility and the amended and restated credit facility 
in addition  we paid million to repurchase  of our common shares  million in dividends to stockholders  million related to the purchase of a portion of our noncontrolling interest of a subsidiary within our dms segment and million to the irs on behalf of certain employees to satisfy minimum tax obligations related to the vesting of certain restricted stock awards as consideration for these payments to the irs  we withheld million of employee owned common stock related to this vesting during the fiscal year ended august  
table of contents sources we may need to finance day to day working capital needs  as well as future growth and any corresponding working capital needs  with additional borrowings under our amended and restated credit facility which is further discussed in the following paragraphs and our other revolving credit facilities described below  as well as additional public and private offerings of our debt and equity 
currently  we have a shelf registration statement with the sec registering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities in the future  from time to time over the three years following the registration  to augment our liquidity and capital resources 
the current shelf registration statement will expire in the first quarter of fiscal year at which time we currently anticipate filing a new shelf registration statement 
any future sale or issuance of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to current or future shareholders 
further  we may issue debt securities that have rights and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on operations  increase debt service obligations  limit our flexibility as a result of debt service requirements and restrictive covenants  potentially negatively affect our credit ratings  and limit our ability to access additional capital or execute our business strategy 
we continue to assess our capital structure and evaluate the merits of redeploying available cash to reduce existing debt or repurchase common shares 
we regularly sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under two asset backed securitization programs  a factoring program and two uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs collectively referred to herein as the programs 
transfers of the receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and  accordingly  net receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
discussion of each of the programs is included in the following paragraphs 
in addition  refer to note trade accounts receivable securitization and sale programs to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the programs 
a 
asset backed securitization programs we continuously sell designated pools of trade accounts receivable under our asset backed securitization programs to special purpose entities  which in turn sell of the receivables to conduits administered by unaffiliated financial institutions for the north american asset backed securitization program and an unaffiliated financial institution for the foreign asset backed securitization program 
any portion of the purchase price for the receivables which is not paid in cash upon the sale taking place is recorded as a deferred purchase price receivable  which is paid from available cash as payments on the receivables are collected 
net cash proceeds up to a maximum of million for the north american asset backed securitization program and million for the foreign asset backed securitization program are available at any one time 
the foreign asset backed securitization program was amended on may  to expire on may  in connection with our asset backed securitization programs  at august   we had sold million of eligible trade accounts receivable  which represents the face amount of total outstanding receivables at that date 
in exchange  we received cash proceeds of million  and a net deferred purchase price receivable 
at august   the net deferred purchase price receivable totaled approximately million 
the deferred purchase price receivable was recorded initially at fair value as prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
b 
trade accounts receivable factoring agreement in connection with a factoring agreement  we transfer ownership of eligible trade accounts receivable of a foreign subsidiary without recourse to a third party purchaser in exchange for cash 
proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the account less a discount 
in april  the factoring agreement was extended through september   at which time it was automatically renewed for an additional six month period 
during the fiscal year ended august   we sold million of trade accounts receivable and received cash proceeds of million 
c 
trade accounts receivable sale programs in connection with two separate uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreements with banks  the second of which was entered into during the first quarter of fiscal year  we may elect to sell and the banks may elect to purchase at a discount  on an ongoing basis  up to a maximum of million and million of specific trade accounts receivable at any one time 
the million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement has no defined termination date and either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than days 
the million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale agreement was amended during the fourth quarter of fiscal year prior 
table of contents to the amendment  the capacity was million

e as of august   six of our foreign subsidiaries have credit facilities that finance their future growth and any corresponding working capital needs 
five of the credit facilities are denominated in us dollars and one is denominated in brazilian reais 
the credit facilities incur interest at fixed and variable rates ranging from to 
on march   we entered into the amended and restated credit facility  which amended and restated the old amended and restated credit facility 
the amended and restated credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility in the initial amount of billion  which may  subject to lenders discretion  potentially be increased up to billion and expires on march  interest and fees on the amended and restated credit facility advances are based on our non credit enhanced long term senior unsecured debt rating as determined by s p and moody s 
interest is charged at a rate equal to either to above the base rate or to above the eurocurrency rate  where the base rate represents the greatest of citibank  na s prime rate  above the federal funds rate  or above one month libor  and the eurocurrency rate represents adjusted libor for the applicable interest period  each as more fully described in the amended and restated credit facility agreement 
fees include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders and a letter of credit fee based on the amount of outstanding letters of credit 
we  along with our subsidiaries  are subject to the following financial covenants a maximum ratio of a debt as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement to b consolidated ebitda as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement and a minimum ratio of a consolidated ebitda to b interest payable on  and amortization of debt discount in respect of  all debt as defined in the amended and restated credit facility agreement and loss on sale of accounts receivables

during fiscal year  we borrowed and repaid billion against the old amended and restated credit facility and the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we borrowed and repaid billion against the amended and restated credit facility under multiple draws 
f on may   we entered into a master lease agreement with a variable interest entity the vie whereby we sell to and subsequently lease back from the vie up to million in certain machinery and equipment for a period of up to five years 
in connection with this transaction  we hold a variable interest in the vie  which was designed to hold debt obligations payable to third party creditors 
the proceeds from such debt obligations are utilized to finance the purchase of the machinery and equipment that is then leased by us 
we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as we have both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
therefore  we consolidate the financial statements of the vie and eliminate all intercompany transactions 
at august   the vie had approximately million of total assets  of which approximately million was comprised of a note receivable due from us  and approximately million of total liabilities  of which approximately million were debt obligations to the third party creditors as the vie has utilized approximately million of the million debt obligation capacity 
the third party creditors have recourse to our general credit only in the event that we default on our obligations under the terms of the master lease agreement 
in addition  the assets held by the vie can be used only to settle the obligations of the vie 

table of contents in addition to the loans described above  at august   we have borrowings outstanding to fund working capital needs 
these additional loans total approximately million and are denominated in euros 
the loans are due and payable within months and are classified as short term on the consolidated balance sheets 
g this amount represents the fair value hedge accounting adjustment related to the senior notes 
for further discussion of our fair value hedges  see note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
at august  and  we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended and restated credit facility and the old amended and restated credit facility  respectively and our securitization programs 
uses on october   january  april   and july   our board of directors approved payment of a quarterly dividend of per share to shareholders of record as of november   february   may   and august  respectively 
the total cash dividend declared on october  of million was paid on december   the total cash dividend declared on january  of million was paid on march   the total cash dividend declared on april  of million was paid on june  and the total cash dividend declared on july  of million was paid on september  we currently expect to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly dividends of an amount similar to our past declarations 
however  the declaration and payment of future dividends are discretionary and will be subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter following its review of our financial performance 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million of our common shares 
we repurchased  shares during the course of fiscal year for approximately million 
in addition  following the end of fiscal year  we repurchased  which is the remaining amount authorized by our board of directors 
on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common shares during the twelve month period following their authorization 
as of october  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
the remaining shares will be repurchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at the company s discretion  subject to market conditions and other factors 
on december   we completed our acquisition of telmar by acquiring of the issued and outstanding common shares of telmar for approximately million in cash which was primarily funded through the old amended and restated credit facility 
refer to note business acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for further details surrounding the telmar acquisition 
our working capital requirements and capital expenditures could continue to increase in order to support future expansions of our operations through construction of greenfield operations or acquisitions 
it is possible that future expansions may be significant and may require the payment of cash 
future liquidity needs will also depend on fluctuations in levels of inventory and shipments  changes in customer order volumes and timing of expenditures for new equipment 
at august   we had approximately billion in cash and cash equivalents 
as our growth remains predominantly outside of the united states  a significant portion of such cash and cash equivalents are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we estimate that approximately million of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries could not be repatriated to the united states without potential income tax consequences 
for discussion of our cash management and risk management policies see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we currently anticipate that during the next months  our capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million  principally for machinery and equipment for new business within our dms segment  maintenance levels of machinery and equipment  information technology infrastructure upgrades and construction of new greenfield facilities 
we believe that our level of resources  which include cash on hand  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities  additional proceeds available under our trade accounts receivable securitization programs and potentially available under our uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale programs and funds provided by operations  will be adequate to fund these capital expenditures  the payment of any declared quarterly dividends  the repurchase of common shares and our working capital requirements for the next months 
our million north american asset backed securitization program expires in october and our million foreign asset backed securitization program expires in may  and we may be unable to renew either of these

our million uncommitted trade accounts receivable sale program will expire no later than june   though either party can elect to cancel the agreement by giving prior written notification to the other party of no less than days 
as the sales programs are uncommitted  we can offer no assurance that if we attempt to draw on such programs in the future that we will receive funding from the associated banks which would require us to utilize other available sources of liquidity  including our revolving credit facilities 
should we desire to consummate significant additional acquisition opportunities or undertake significant additional expansion activities  our capital needs would increase and could possibly result in our need to increase available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities or access public or private debt and equity markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in raising additional debt or equity on terms that we would consider acceptable 
see risk factors our amount of debt could significantly increase in the future 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations for short and long term debt arrangements  future interest on notes payable and long term debt  future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating lease arrangements  pensions and employee benefit obligations and capital commitments as of august  are summarized below 
we generally do not enter into non cancelable purchase orders for materials until we receive a corresponding purchase commitment from our customer

d includes the estimated company contributions to funded pension plans during fiscal and the expected benefit payments for unfunded pension and postretirement plans from fiscal through these future payments are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet but will be recorded as incurred 
e during the first quarter of fiscal year  we committed million to an independent private equity limited partnership which invests in companies that address resource limits in energy  water and materials commonly referred to as the cleantech sector 
of that amount  we have invested million as of august  the remaining commitment of million is callable over the next months by the general partner 
f at august   we have million and million recorded as a current and a long term liability  respectively  for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments  or the amount by which our liability for these uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease over time  and accordingly  this liability has been excluded from the above table

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in various foreign countries and are  therefore  subject to risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into forward contracts to economically hedge transactional exposure associated with commitments arising from trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  intercompany transactions and fixed purchase obligations denominated in a 
table of contents currency other than the functional currency of the respective operating entity 
we do not intend to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their respective fair values 
at august   except for certain foreign currency contracts with a notional amount outstanding of million and a fair value of million recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and million recorded in accrued expenses  we have elected not to prepare and maintain the documentation required for the transactions to qualify as accounting hedges and  therefore  changes in fair value are recorded within our consolidated statements of operations 
the aggregate notional amount of outstanding contracts at august  that do not qualify as accounting hedges was million 
the fair value of these contracts amounted to a million asset recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a million liability recorded to accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
the forward contracts both those that are designated as accounting hedging instruments and those that are not will generally expire in less than three months  with five months being the maximum term of the contracts outstanding at august  the change in fair value related to contracts designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in the revenue or expense line in which the underlying transaction occurs within our consolidated statements of operations 
the change in fair value related to contracts not designated as accounting hedging instruments will be reflected in cost of revenue within our consolidated statements of operations 
the forward contracts are denominated in brazilian reais  british pounds  canadian dollars  chinese yuan renminbis  euros  hungarian forints  indian rupees  japanese yen  malaysian ringgits  mexican pesos  polish zlotys  russian rubles  swedish krona  tawain dollars and us dollars 
based on our overall currency rate exposures as of august   including the derivative financial instruments intended to hedge the nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  an immediate hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our domestic investment portfolio 
we do not  and do not intend to  use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions 
we protect our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate these risks by generally investing in investment grade securities and by frequently positioning the portfolio to try to respond appropriately to a reduction in credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository to levels below the credit ratings dictated by our investment policy 
the portfolio typically includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
at august   there were no significant outstanding investments 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a series of interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million designated as fair value hedges of a portion of our senior notes 
under these interest rate swaps  we received fixed rate interest payments and paid interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a spread 
the effect of these swaps was to convert fixed rate interest expense on a portion of the senior notes to floating rate interest expense 
gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded to interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying senior notes 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we terminated the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with the senior notes with a fair value of million  including accrued interest of million at august  the portion of the fair value that is not accrued interest is recorded as a hedge accounting adjustment to the carrying amount of the senior notes and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes 
at august   the hedge accounting adjustment recorded is million in the consolidated balance sheets 
we pay interest on several of our outstanding borrowings at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under these facilities at august  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note notes payable and long term debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our outstanding debt obligations 
the effect of an immediate hypothetical change in variable interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
