item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing high resolution miniature laser display and imaging engines based upon our proprietary picop display engine technology 
our picop technology utilizes our widely patented expertise in two dimensional micro electrical mechanical systems mems  lasers  optics and electronics to create a high quality video or still image from a small form factor device with lower power needs than conventional display technologies 
our strategy is to develop and supply picop display engines to original equipment manufacturers oems that would embed them into a variety of consumer  automotive  enterprise and industrial products 
in markets requiring high volume production of the picop display engine components or subsystems that are to be integrated with other components  we plan to provide designs for components  subsystems and systems to oems under licensing agreements 
the primary objective for consumer applications is to provide users of mobile consumer devices such as smartphones  media players  tablet pcs and other consumer electronics products with a large screen viewing experience produced by a small embedded projector 
these potential products would allow users to watch movies and videos  play video games  and display images and other data onto a variety of surfaces  freeing users from the limitations of a small  palm sized screen 
the picop could be further modified to be embedded into a pair of glasses to provide the mobile user with a see through or occluded personal display to view movies  play games or access other content 
the picop with some modification could be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone aftermarket device to create a high resolution head up display hud that could project point by point navigation  critical operational  safety and other information important to the vehicle operator 
the enterprise products employing our technology would allow users in field based professions such as service repair or sales to view and share information such as schematics for equipment repair and sales data and orders within crm applications on a larger  more user friendly interface 
we also see potential for embedding the picop laser display engine in industrial products where our displays could be used for d measuring and digital signage  enhancing the overall user experience of these applications 
we currently market and sell our showwx line of accessory pico projectors  which use our picop display engine through a network of global distributors 
we continue to enter into a limited number of development agreements with commercial and us government customers to develop advanced prototypes and demonstration units based on our light scanning technologies 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ending december  key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our product sales generally include acceptance provisions 
we recognize product revenue upon acceptance of the product by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period  after which there are no rights of return 
we have entered into agreements with resellers and distributors  as well as selling directly to the public 
sales made to resellers and distributors are recognized using either the sell through method or upon expiration of the contractually agreed upon acceptance period  depending on our ability to reasonably estimate returns 
some of the agreements with resellers and distributors contain price protection clauses  and revenue is recognized net of these amounts 
sales made directly to the public are recognized either upon expiration of the contractual acceptance period after which there are no rights of return  or net of estimated returns and allowances 
provisions are made for warranties at the time revenue is recorded 
our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and availability of components and raw materials 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee  and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we have developed processes that allow us to make reasonable estimates of the cost to complete a contract 
when we begin work on the contract and at the end of each accounting period  we estimate the labor  material and other costs required to complete the contract using information provided by our technical team  project managers  vendors  outside consultants and others and compare these to costs incurred to date 
since our contracts generally require some level of technology development to complete  the actual cost required to complete a contract can vary from our estimates 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as actual cost becomes certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  we have made only immaterial revisions in the estimates to complete the contract at each reporting period 
in the future  revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
we recognize contract revenue on the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits upon acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period  after which there are no rights of return 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts and producing prototype units  evaluation kits  showwx and rov units 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract or producing prototype units  evaluation kits  and accessory pico projector products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our manufacturing and technical capabilities and capacity 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  and facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
losses on uncompleted contracts 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if the estimated cost to complete a contract exceeds the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer s and related party s past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist entirely of purchased patents 
the patents are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit  ranging from one to years 
we evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a net realizable value basis 
we make significant judgments and estimates to value our inventory and make adjustments to its carrying value 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials  the net realizable value of the finished goods  and the likelihood of obsolescence 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock and restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock 
we account for equity instruments issued to employees using the straight line attribution method of allocating the fair value of share based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award 
the value of restricted or unrestricted shares is determined using the fair value method  which is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
the value of options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model with estimates of option lives  stock price volatilities and interest rates  then expensed over the periods of service allowing for pre vest forfeitures 
this widely accepted method results in reasonable option values and interperiod expense allocation  and comparability across companies 
changes in the estimated inputs or using other option valuation methods could result in materially different option values and share based compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years

of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands pico projector revenue   bar code revenue total product revenue   pico projector revenue includes the sales of our showwx line of accessory pico projectors and related accessories  and picop engines 
pico projector revenue was higher for the year ended december  than the same period in  as a result of increased sales of our picop engines compared to the prior year and a one time sale of our pico projectors to one customer 
bar code revenue was lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  due to our decision to stop marketing our bar code product during and focus on commercializing the picop technology 
we do not expect to increase our investment in the bar code product in the future 
our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and availability of components and raw materials 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately million  compared to million at december  product backlog is scheduled for delivery within one year 
in september  we received orders of million from esplus for embedded display engines  the majority of which were scheduled for delivery in the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  esplus determined that it needed additional time to mature the commercial readiness of its media player product and elected to defer picop engine shipments into as a result  we have removed orders of million from this customer from our product backlog as of december  we are working with esplus to determine a new delivery schedule 
contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands government revenue commercial revenue total contract revenue  contract revenue from government and commercial contracts was higher during than in due to increased activity on new and existing government and commercial contracts compared to the previous year 
our backlog of development contracts  including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits  at december  was  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts compared to  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts at december  we plan to complete the entire contract backlog within one year 
cost of product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of product revenue   our costs to produce accessory pico projector units during were substantially higher than product revenue 
cost of product revenue includes the direct and allocated indirect cost of manufacturing products sold to customers 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of these products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
in the event that we maintain production capacity in excess of production requirements  cost of product revenue may also include manufacturing overhead associated with the excess capacity 
cost of product revenue for and included write downs of million and million  respectively  for inventory in stock at the end of the year 
the write downs were primarily for lower of cost or market adjustments to our inventory value to reflect the then current estimated selling price for our inventory  as well as a reserve adjustment for materials which we expect would become obsolete as we introduced new products 
the decrease in cost of product revenue for  compared to  was primarily attributed to decreased inventory write downs compared to the prior year 
during  we sold inventory which had been previously written down to the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  cost of product revenue for did not include approximately million of previously recognized write downs associated with this inventory 
during  we recognized approximately  of warranty expense primarily associated with our picop display engine 
warranty expense in was not material 
during  we expensed approximately million of manufacturing overhead associated with production capacity in excess of production requirements 
we did not expense any overhead associated with excess capacity during we classified overhead cost allocated to the accessory pico projector as research and development expense until february  when we determined that the product s design and production processes were mature enough to support commercial production and we began classifying overhead cost as cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
the decrease in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in compared to the same period in was due to decreased inventory write downs for the showwx family of products 
cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of contract revenue  the cost of contract revenue was higher in than in as a result of the increased activity on development contracts and recognized losses on two contracts on which we performed work during the losses were primarily as a result of our decision to share costs with one customer for development of advanced in vehicle hud prototypes in anticipation of follow on revenue opportunities and excess material costs associated with minimum order quantities for materials required to complete one of our development contracts 
gross margin on contract revenue was significantly lower in compared to  as a result of these recognized losses 
the combined impact of the losses on contracts and lower gross margin was approximately the cost of contract revenue as a percentage of revenue was higher in than in as a result of the recognized losses and higher labor expense resulting from a change in the labor resources allocated to the contracts 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
research and development expense 
change change in thousands research and development    research and development expense consists of compensation related costs of employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  direct material to support development programs  laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  and other operating expenses 
we allocate our research and development resources based on the business opportunity of the available projects  the skill mix of the resources available and the contractual commitments we have made to customers 
the decrease in research and development expense during  compared to the same period in  is primarily attributable to decreased subcontractor costs associated with advanced research and decreased payroll costs due to reductions in staffing levels  compared to the prior year 
in  we aggressively managed our operating expenses as part of our strategy to simplify operations and significantly reduce our cash requirements as we focused our efforts on development of the next generation of our picop technology based on direct green lasers 
as a result  our research and development expense significantly decreased for compared to we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the picop technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial

no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we have research and development tax credits of million 
the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits available to offset future taxable income  if any  will expire in varying amounts from to if not previously utilized 
in  million in net operating loss carry forwards expired 
the research and development tax credits and the remaining net operating losses are scheduled to expire between and in certain circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that such a change of ownership occurred during and that the annual utilization of loss carry forwards generated through the period of that change will be limited to approximately million

our contract revenue in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
contract revenue from government and commercial contracts was substantially lower during than in due to reduced contract activity and lower beginning backlog in compared to the previous year 
our backlog of development contracts  including orders for prototype units and evaluation kits  at december  was  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts compared to  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts at december  the increase in backlog from is primarily attributed to two contracts with the us government entered into in late cost of product revenue

the increase in cost of product revenue for  compared to  was primarily attributed to increased material costs associated with higher volumes of product shipments and increased inventory write downs compared to the prior year 
the increase in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in compared to the same period in was due to an increase in inventory write downs and a higher cost structure for the showwx product

no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we had research and development tax credits of million 
we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at december  or at december  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant losses since inception 
we have funded operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock  convertible preferred stock  warrants  the issuance of convertible debt and  to a lesser extent  from development contract revenues and product sales 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investment securities  available for sale 
during  we lowered our cash used in operations significantly  through a combination of sharing development and commercialization costs of the next generation picop technology based on direct green lasers with our development partners  limiting our investment into advancement of the current generation picop technology based on synthetic green lasers  moving product development to original design manufacturers lowering our working capital requirements through a restructuring of inventory cycles with major suppliers  reducing our operating costs through a workforce reduction completed in january  in addition to other measures 
based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through june we will require additional cash to fund our operating plan past that time 
we are introducing new products into an emerging market which creates significant uncertainty about our ability to accurately project revenue  costs and cash flows 
if the level of sales anticipated by our financial plan is not achieved or our working capital requirements are higher than planned  we will need to raise additional cash sooner or take actions to reduce operating expenses 
we plan to obtain additional cash through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that additional cash will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis we may be required to limit our operations substantially 
this limitation of operations could include reducing our planned investment in working capital to fund revenue growth and delaying development projects resulting in reductions in staff  operating costs  capital expenditures and investment in research and development 
we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm regarding the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  that includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
these financial statements are prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
cash used in operating activities totaled million during  compared to million during during  the decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by lower inventory purchases for commercialization of picop based products as well as savings resulting from steps taken to lower our cash use as described above 
investing activities cash provided by investing activities totaled  in compared to  in in  the decrease in cash provided by investing activities primarily resulted from lower cash inflows generated from sales of investment securities compared to  offset by fewer cash outflows associated with implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system and production equipment purchases compared to one year ago 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  compared to million in the following is a list of our financing activities during   and all share amounts have been adjusted for the reverse stock split discussed in this annual report 
in november  we raised approximately million  before issuance costs of approximately  through an underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock 
during  we also raised an aggregate of million  before issuance costs of approximately  from the sale of million shares of our common stock under our committed equity financing facilities with azimuth 
we terminated one of these facilities in july and the other two in november in  we raised an aggregate of million  before issuance costs of approximately  from the sale of million shares of our common stock under our committed equity financing facility with azimuth 
in november and december  we raised an aggregate of million  before issuance costs of approximately million  from the sale of million shares of our common stock through underwritten public offerings 
during  we raised million from the exercise of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and million from the exercise of  stock options 
in june  we raised approximately million  before issuance costs of approximately  from the sale of million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock to a strategic investor 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  a three year term  and are exercisable on the date of issuance 
we can call the warrants if the average closing bid price of our stock is over for any consecutive trading days 
our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with oems  introduce products incorporating our technology and the market acceptance and competitive position of such products 
future operating expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress of research and development programs  the progress in commercialization activities and arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
in order to maintain our exclusive rights under our license agreement with the university of washington  we are obligated to make royalty payments to the university of washington with respect to the virtual retinal display technology 
if we are successful in establishing original equipment manufacturer co development and joint venture arrangements  we expect our partners to fund certain non recurring engineering costs for technology development and or for product development 
nevertheless  we expect our cash requirements to remain high as we expand our activities and operations with the objective of commercializing our light scanning technology

the standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented
