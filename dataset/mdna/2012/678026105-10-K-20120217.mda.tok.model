item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accommodations business is significantly influenced by the level of development of oil sands deposits in alberta  canada  activity levels in support of oil and gas development in canada and the united states and in natural resource markets  primarily in australia 
despite the general economic downturn in and early as a result of the global financial crisis  activity in our accommodations business has grown significantly in the last six years 

table of contents 
index to financial statements new order activity for deepwater capital equipment was limited beginning in the fourth quarter of and continued to decline throughout due to project postponements  cancellations and deferrals by customers as a result of the general economic downturn  reduced oil prices and the macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico 
this reduction in order activity led to declines in our offshore products backlog and decreased revenues and profits in with the improvement in oil prices over the last two years along with the improved outlook for long term oil demand  we began experiencing increased bidding and quoting activity for our offshore products in the latter part of that continued throughout  although such activity levels were negatively affected by the macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico and resultant regulatory delays and subsequent rulemaking 
as a result of this increased activity  backlog in our offshore products segment increased from million as of december  to a record million as of december  we anticipate global deepwater spending to continue including new award opportunities coming from brazil  west africa  the us gulf of mexico  south east asia and australia over the next twelve months 
our well site services businesses are significantly influenced by drilling and completion activity primarily in the us and  to a lesser extent  canada and the rest of the world 
activity levels materially declined throughout in most of our well site services businesses 
activity levels in and improved significantly off their troughs 
until recently  overall industry activity has been primarily driven by spending for natural gas exploration and production  particularly in the shale play regions of the us using horizontal drilling and completion techniques 
however  with higher oil prices  lower natural gas prices and the advancement of horizontal drilling and completion techniques  activity in north america has shifted to a greater proportion of oil and liquids rich drilling 
according to rig count data published by baker hughes incorporated  the oil rig count in the us now totals approximately  rigs  the highest oil related rig count in over years  comprising approximately of total us drilling activity 
our tubular services business is influenced by the overall level of us drilling activity  the types of wells being drilled  movements in global steel and steel input prices and the overall industry level of oil country tubular goods octg inventory and pricing 
our tubular services business has historically been our most cyclical business segment 
declining octg prices in coupled with weaker demand for octg  caused by a decline in us drilling  led to significantly lower revenues and margins for our tubular services business in the recovery in us drilling activity beginning in and continuing throughout led to increased tubular services volumes and revenues 
price increases announced by the major us mills during resulted in increased margins for our tubular services business in accommodations overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our accommodations segment 
we are one of north america s and  as a result of our acquisition of the mac in december  australia s largest integrated providers of accommodations services for people working in remote locations 
our scalable modular facilities provide temporary and permanent work force accommodations where traditional infrastructure is not accessible or cost effective 
once facilities are deployed in the field  we also provide catering and food services  housekeeping  laundry  facility management  water and wastewater treatment  power generation  communications and redeployment logistics 
our accommodations are employed to support work forces in the canadian oil sands and in a variety of oil and natural gas drilling  mining and related natural resource applications as well as forest fire fighting and disaster relief efforts  primarily in canada  australia and the united states 
accommodations market our accommodations business has grown significantly in recent years in large part due to the increasing demand for accommodations to support workers in the oil sands region of canada 
demand for oil sands accommodations is influenced to a great extent by the longer term outlook for crude oil prices rather than current energy prices  given the multi year time frame to complete oil sands projects and the costs associated with development of such large scale projects 
utilization of our existing canadian accommodations capacity and our future expansions will largely depend on continued oil sands development spending

index to financial statements beginning in  as a result of our acquisition of the mac  our accommodations business entered into the australian natural resources market 
the australian natural resources sector plays a vital role in the australian economy 
the growth of australian natural resource commodity exports over the last decade has been largely driven by strong asian demand for iron ore  coal and liquefied natural gas lng 
the australian natural resources sector is australia s largest contributor to exports  a major contributor to gross domestic product  a major employer and a major contributor to government revenue 
the current activities of our australian accommodations business are primarily related to supplying accommodations in support of metallurgical coal mining in the bowen basin region of queensland 
volumes and prices of commodities have historically varied significantly and are difficult to predict 
mineral and commodity prices have fluctuated in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
strong economic growth in emerging economies  such as china and india  with associated strong demand for mineral and natural resources such as coal  iron ore and lng  has more than offset more moderate growth in the developed economies including the united states  japan and europe 
this demand is expected to underpin continued investment and growth in the australian natural resources market 
products and services since mid year  we have installed over  rooms in our lodge properties supporting oil sands activities in northern alberta 
our growth plan for this part of our business includes the expansion of these properties where we believe there is durable long term demand 
during  we added  rooms net of retirements to its major oil sands lodges by expanding its wapasu creek and athabasca lodges and constructing the new henday lodge 
we are currently expanding the capacity of our beaver river executive lodge  athabasca lodge and henday lodge 
these expansions will add approximately rooms by the end of the first half of our australian accommodations business operates eight villages with over  rooms and has a significant development portfolio in australia 
the mac provides accommodation services to mining and related service companies including construction contractors under medium term contracts three to five years 
our australian accommodations villages are strategically located in proximity to long life  low cost mines operated by large mining companies 
during  the company added  rooms net of retirements to its australian accommodations business by expanding existing villages and by constructing two new villages 
we are currently expanding the capacity of several of our australian villages and constructing a new village in karratha  western australia

we manufacture accommodations facilities to suit the climate  terrain and population of a specific project site 
to a significant extent  the company s recent capital expenditures have focused on opportunities in the oil sands region in northern alberta and  beginning in  in our australian accommodations business 
since the beginning of  we have spent million  or  of our total consolidated capital expenditures in our canadian and australian accommodations business 
most of the capital investments in canada have been in support of oil sands developments  both for initial construction phases and ongoing operations 
oil sands related accommodations revenues have increased from of total accommodations revenues in to in regions of operations our accommodations business is focused primarily in northern canada and queensland  australia  but also operates in western australia  new south wales  the us rocky mountain corridor and the bakken shale region montana  north dakota and saskatchewan  canada  the fayetteville shale region of arkansas  the eagle ford shale region of texas and offshore locations in the gulf of mexico

table of contents 
index to financial statements flexible bearings and connector products 
we are the principal supplier of flexible bearings  or flexjoints  to the offshore oil and gas industry 
we also supply weld on connectors and fittings that join lengths of large diameter conductor or casing used in offshore drilling operations 
flexjoints are flexible bearings that permit the controlled movement of riser pipes or tension leg platform tethers under high tension and pressure 
they are used on drilling  production and export risers and are used increasingly as offshore production moves to deeper water areas 
drilling riser systems provide the vertical conduit between the floating drilling vessel and the subsea wellhead 
through the drilling riser  equipment is guided into the well and drilling fluids are returned to the surface 
production riser systems provide the vertical conduit for the hydrocarbons from the subsea wellhead to the floating production platform 
oil and natural gas flows to the surface for processing through the production riser 
export risers provide the vertical conduit from the floating production platform to the subsea export pipelines 
flexjoints are a critical element in the construction and operation of production and export risers on floating production systems in deepwater 
floating production systems  including tension leg platforms  spars and fpso facilities  are a significant means of producing oil and gas  particularly in deepwater environments 
we provide many important products for the construction of these facilities 
a tension leg platform is a floating platform that is moored by vertical pipes  or tethers  attached to both the platform and the sea floor 
our flexjoint tether bearings are used at the top and bottom connections of each of the tethers  and our merlin connectors are used to efficiently assemble the tethers during offshore installation 
a spar is a floating vertical cylindrical structure which is approximately six to seven times longer than its diameter and is anchored in place 
an fpso is a floating vessel  typically ship shaped  used to produce  and process oil and gas from subsea wells 
our flexjoints are also used to attach the steel catenary risers to a spar  fpso or tension leg platform and for use on import or export risers 
subsea pipeline products 
we design and manufacture a variety of equipment used in the construction  maintenance  expansion and repair of offshore oil and natural gas pipelines 
new construction equipment includes pipeline end manifolds  pipeline end terminals  midline tie in sleds  forged steel y shaped connectors for joining two pipelines into one  pressure balanced safety joints for protecting pipelines and related equipment from anchor snags or a shifting sea bottom  electrical isolation joints  and hot tap clamps that allow new pipelines to be joined into existing lines without interrupting the flow of petroleum product 
we provide diverless connection systems for subsea flowlines and pipelines 
our hydrotech collet connectors provide a high integrity  proprietary metal to metal sealing system for the final hook up of deep offshore pipelines and production systems 
they also are used in diverless pipeline repair systems and in future pipeline tie in systems 
our lateral tie in sled  which is installed with the original pipeline  allows a subsea tie in to be made quickly and efficiently using proven hydrotech connectors without costly offshore equipment mobilization and without shutting off product flow 
we provide pipeline repair hardware  including deepwater applications beyond the depth of diver intervention 
our products include repair clamps used to seal leaks and restore the structural integrity of a pipeline  mechanical connectors used in repairing subsea pipelines without having to weld  misalignment and swivel ring flanges  and pipe recovery tools for recovering dropped or damaged pipelines

we can provide complete turnkey and design fabrication services 
we also design and manufacture a variety of custom subsea equipment  such as riser flotation tank systems  guide bases  running tools and manifolds 
in addition  we also offer blow out preventer and drilling riser testing and repair services 
to a lesser extent  our offshore products segment also produces a variety of products for use in applications other than in the offshore oil and gas industry 
for example  we provide elastomer consumable downhole products for onshore drilling and production  sound and vibration isolation equipment for the us navy submarine fleet  metal elastomeric flexjoints used in a variety of naval and marine applications  and drum clutches and brakes for heavy duty power transmission in the mining  paper  logging and marine industries 
backlog 
backlog in our offshore products segment was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we expect in excess of of our backlog at december  to be recognized as revenue during our offshore products backlog consists of firm customer purchase orders for which contractual commitments exist and delivery is scheduled 
in some instances  these purchase orders are cancelable by the customer  subject to the payment of termination fees and or the reimbursement of our costs incurred 
our backlog is an important indicator of future offshore products shipments and revenues  however  backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period 
we believe that the offshore construction and development business is characterized by lengthy projects and a long lead time order cycle 
the change in backlog levels from one period to the next does not necessarily evidence a long term trend 
regions of operations our offshore products segment provides products and services to customers in the major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including the gulf of mexico  west africa  azerbaijan  the north sea  brazil  southeast asia  india and australia 
customers and competitors we market our products and services to a broad customer base  including direct end users  engineering and design companies  prime contractors  and at times  our competitors through outsourcing arrangements 
our largest customers in were halliburton company  transocean ltd  and chevron corporation 
our main competitors include techlam  cameron international corporation  sea trax  inc  ge oil gas  and national oilwell varco  inc well site services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our well site services segment 
our well site services segment includes a broad range of products and services that are used to drill for  establish and maintain the flow of oil 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and natural gas from a well throughout its lifecycle 
in this segment  our operations include completion focused equipment and services as well as land drilling services 
we use our fleet of drilling rigs and rental equipment to serve our customers at well sites and project development locations 
our products and services are used primarily in onshore applications throughout the exploration  development and production phases of a well s life 
well site services market demand for our drilling rigs and rental equipment has historically been tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity 
the primary driver for this activity is the price of oil and natural gas 
activity levels have been  and we expect will continue to be  highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices 
products and services rental equipment 
our rental equipment business provides a wide range of products and services for use in the onshore and offshore oil and gas industry  including wireline and coiled tubing pressure control equipment  wellhead isolation equipment  pipe recovery systems  thru tubing fishing services  hydraulic chokes and manifolds  blow out preventers  well testing and flowback equipment  including separators and line heaters  gravel pack operations on well bores  and surface control equipment and down hole tools utilized by coiled tubing operators 
our rental equipment is primarily used during the completion and production stages of a well 
as of december   we provided rental equipment at distribution points throughout the united states  canada  mexico and argentina  compared to distribution points at december  we continue to consolidate operations in areas where our product lines previously had separate facilities and close facilities in areas where operations are marginal in order to streamline operations  enhance our facilities and improve marketing efficiency 
we provide rental equipment on a daily rental basis with rates varying depending on the type of equipment and the length of time rented 
generally  this equipment is operated or installed by our field technicians in connection with the equipment rental 
we own patents covering some of our rental tools  particularly in our wellhead isolation equipment product line 
our customers in the rental equipment business include major  independent and private oil and gas companies and other large oilfield service companies 
our largest customers in were anadarko petroleum corporation and chesapeake energy 
competition in the rental tools and services business is widespread and includes many smaller companies  although we also compete with the larger oilfield service companies for certain products and services 
the growth in the oil and gas industry in increased demand for our rental tools equipment and services  which resulted in both higher revenues and margins when compared to drilling services 
our drilling services business is located in the united states and provides land drilling services for shallow to medium depth wells ranging from  to  feet 
we serve two primary markets with our drilling services business the permian basin in west texas and the rocky mountain region 
drilling services are typically used during the exploration and development stages of a field 
as of december   after taking two of our smaller rigs out of commission in  we had a total of semi automatic drilling rigs with hydraulic pipe handling booms and lift capacities ranging from  to  pounds  of which were fabricated and or assembled in our odessa  texas facility with components purchased from specialty vendors 
twenty five of these drilling rigs are based in odessa  texas and nine are based in the rocky mountains region 
utilization of our drilling rigs increased from an average of in to an average of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in on december   of our rigs were working or under contract with utilization of approximately 
subsequent to december   we lost one of our drilling rigs located in the rocky mountain region as a result of a constructive total loss due to a fire 
we market our drilling services directly to a diverse customer base  consisting of major  independent and private oil and gas companies 
we contract on both footage and dayrate basis 
under a footage drilling contract  we assume responsibility for certain costs such as bits and fuel and assume more risk such as time necessary to drill than we would on a daywork contract 
depending on market conditions and availability of drilling rigs  we see changes in pricing  utilization and contract terms 
our largest customers in were energen resources corporation  apache corporation and sandridge energy  inc the land drilling business is highly fragmented  and our competition consists of a small number of larger companies and many smaller companies 
our permian basin drilling activities target primarily oil reservoirs while our rocky mountain drilling activities target oil  liquids rich and natural gas reservoirs 
tubular services overview during the year ended december   we generated approximately of our revenue and of our operating income  before corporate charges  from our tubular services segment 
through our sooner  inc subsidiary  we distribute octg and provide associated octg finishing and logistics services to the oil and gas industry 
octg consist of downhole casing and production tubing 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute a broad range of casing and tubing  and provide threading  logistical and inventory management services 
we serve a customer base ranging from major oil and gas companies to small independents 
through our key relationships with more than domestic and foreign manufacturers and related service providers and suppliers of octg  we deliver tubular products and ancillary services to oil and gas companies  drilling contractors and consultants predominantly in the united states 
the octg distribution market is highly fragmented and competitive  and is focused in the united states 
we purchase tubular goods from a variety of sources  however  during  we purchased of our total tubular goods from a single domestic supplier and of our total octg purchases were from three suppliers 
octg market our tubular services segment primarily distributes casing and tubing 
casing forms the structural wall in oil and natural gas wells to provide support  control pressure and prevent collapse during drilling operations 
casing is also used to protect water bearing formations during the drilling of a well 
casing is generally not removed after it has been installed in a well 
production tubing  which is used to bring oil and natural gas to the surface  may be replaced during the life of a producing well 
a key indicator of domestic demand for octg is the aggregate footage of wells drilled onshore and offshore in the united states 
the octg market is also affected by the level of inventories maintained by manufacturers  distributors and end users 
inventory on the ground  when at high levels  can cause tubular sales to lag a rig count increase due to inventory destocking and can put downward pressure on octg pricing 
demand for tubular products is positively impacted by increased drilling of deeper  horizontal and offshore wells 
deeper wells require incremental tubular footage and enhanced mechanical capabilities to ensure the integrity of the well 
premium tubulars are generally used in deeper wells and in horizontal drilling to withstand the increased bending and compression loading associated with a horizontal well 
operators typically specify premium tubulars for the completion of offshore wells 
products and services tubular products and services 
we distribute various types of octg produced by both domestic and foreign manufacturers to major and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and other octg distributors 
we have distribution relationships with most major domestic and certain international steel 
table of contents 
index to financial statements mills 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute and  as a result  gross margins in this segment are generally lower than those reported by our other business segments 
we operate our tubular services segment from a total of ten offices and facilities located near areas of oil and natural gas exploration and development activity 
in our tubular services segment  inventory management is critical to our success 
we maintain on the ground inventory in five company owned yards and approximately third party yards located in the united states  giving us the flexibility to fill customer orders from our own stock or directly from the manufacturer 
we have an inventory management system  designed specifically for the octg industry  which enables us to track our product inventory and shipments

our montoursville  pennsylvania location  which services the marcellus shale area  has more than pipe racks on acres 
independent third party inspection companies operate within each of these facilities either with mobile or permanent inspection equipment 
tubular products and services sales arrangements 
we provide our tubular products and logistics services through a variety of arrangements  including spot market sales and alliances 
we provide some of our tubular products and services to independent and major oil and gas companies under alliance or program arrangements 
alliance or program arrangements refer to agreements whereby a customer bids the tubular requirements for a number of wells at one time 
although our alliances are generally not as profitable as the spot market and can generally be cancelled by the customer  they provide us with more stable and predictable revenues and an improved ability to forecast required inventory levels  which allows us to manage our inventory more efficiently 
regions of operations our tubular services segment provides tubular products and services principally to customers in the united states both for land and offshore applications 
however  we also sell a small percentage for export worldwide 
suppliers  customers and competitors we source the octg we sell from domestic and international manufacturers 
our largest supplier is us steel group 
although we have a leading market share position in tubular services distribution  the market is highly fragmented 
our largest customers in were chesapeake energy  conocophillips  and occidental petroleum corporation 
our main competitors in tubular distribution are edgen group inc  mrc global  inc  pipeco services inc 
and premier pipe lp

index to financial statements seasonality of operations our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate  most notably in canada  australia  the rocky mountain region and the gulf of mexico 
a portion of our canadian accommodations operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur 
the spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the second quarter and adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services 
during the australian rainy season  generally between the months of november and april  our accommodations operations in queensland and the northern parts of western australia can be affected by cyclones  monsoons and resultant flooding 
severe winter weather conditions in the rocky mountain region can restrict access to work areas for our well site services and accommodations segment operations 
our operations in the gulf of mexico are also affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions in the gulf coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months 
as a result of these seasonal differences  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
in addition  summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
for example  during  a significant disruption occurred in oil and natural gas drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico due to damage inflicted by hurricanes katrina and rita and  during  from hurricane ike 
employees as of december   the company had  full time employees on a consolidated basis  of whom are in our accommodations segment  of whom are in our well site services segment  of whom are in our offshore products segment  of whom are in our tubular services segment and of whom are in our corporate headquarters 
we were party to collective bargaining agreements covering  employees located in canada  australia  the united kingdom and argentina as of december  we believe relations with our employees are good 
government regulation our business is significantly affected by foreign and domestic laws and regulations at the federal  provincial  state and local levels relating to the oil  natural gas and mining industries  mining worker safety and environmental protection 
changes in these laws  including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations  could significantly affect our business 
we cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations or how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our future operations or earnings 
we also are not able to predict whether additional laws and regulations will be adopted 
we depend on the demand for our products and services from oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
this demand is affected by changing taxes  price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry generally  including those specifically directed to oilfield and offshore operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations curtailing exploration and development drilling for oil and natural gas in our areas of operation could also adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our products and services 
we cannot determine the extent to which our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in existing regulations or enforcement 
some of our employees who perform services on offshore platforms and vessels are covered by the provisions of the jones act  the death on the high seas act and general maritime law 
these laws operate to make the liability limits established under states workers compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and permit them or their representatives generally to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries with no limitations on our potential liability 
our operations are subject to numerous stringent and comprehensive foreign  federal  provincial  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release and or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws  for which compliance is often costly and difficult 
the violation 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits  issuance of corrective action orders  modification or cessation of operations  assessment of administrative and civil penalties  and even criminal prosecution 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and we do not anticipate that future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
however  there can be no assurance that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non compliance with these existing requirements will not be incurred in the future 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations  could result in additional costs or liabilities that we cannot currently quantify 
for example  in canada  the federal government in september appointed an oil sands advisory panel to review and comment upon existing scientific studies and literature regarding water monitoring in the lower athabasca region and provide recommendations for improving such monitoring 
the oil sands advisory panel presented its final report to the minister of the environment in december in response to this report  environment canada  with input from the government of alberta through alberta environment  developed an environmental monitoring plan  the first phase of which was published in march this monitoring plan  when and if implemented  would establish more comprehensive monitoring programs for water quality  aquatic ecosystems  air quality and terrestrial biodiversity and habitat 
the results of such monitoring may lead to increased levels of regulation and cost of government oversight 
further  in january  the province of alberta established a provincial environmental monitoring panel with a mandate to recommend a world class environmental evaluation  monitoring and reporting system  generally for the province and specifically for the lower athabasca region where oil sands are produced 
this panel issued its recommendations to the alberta minister of the environment in july if and when new monitoring systems or requirements are implemented  these new requirements may increase costs and lead to increased levels of regulation  enforcement and cost for us and our customers and reduced activity and demand for our services 
further  the province of alberta released a report in december regarding regulatory changes to be implemented in regarding alberta environment s regulation of oil sands operations 
the report proposed regulatory changes would include increased reclamation security requirements  increased monitoring requirements for water quality  and additional requirements for the management of tailings ponds 
so far  the government of alberta has revised security requirements for all mines  including oil sands mines 
these revised security requirements  as well as the additional contemplated changes  may result in additional costs or liabilities for our customers operations 
with regard to our us operations  we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  which are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act  as amended  or rcra  and comparable state statutes 
the united states environmental protection agency  or epa  and comparable state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for some types of hazardous wastes and nonhazardous solid wastes 
some wastes handled by us in our field service activities currently are exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes under rcra because that act specifically excludes drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or exploration of oil or natural gas from regulation as hazardous waste 
however  these wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes 
for instance  in september  the natural resources defense council filed a petition for rulemaking with the epa requesting reconsideration of the continued application of this rcra exclusion but  to date  the epa has not taken any action on the petition 
a loss of this exclusion would subject us to more rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements 
in any event  such wastes may remain subject to regulation under rcra as nonhazardous solid wastes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state statutes impose liability  without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct  on classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment

under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several  strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment 
we currently have operations in the united states on properties where activities involving the handling of hazardous substances or wastes may have been conducted prior to our operations on such properties or by third parties whose operations were not under our control 
these properties may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws and related regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate previously discarded hazardous substances and wastes or property contamination that was caused by these third parties 
these laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for our acts that were in compliance with applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
in the course of our domestic operations  some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radiation associated with oil and natural gas deposits  and this exposure may result in the generation of wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials or norm 
norm wastes exhibiting trace levels of naturally occurring radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements  and any storage vessels  piping  and work area affected by norm may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements 
because many of the properties presently or previously owned  operated  or occupied by us have been used for oil and gas production operations for many years  it is possible that we may incur costs or liabilities associated with elevated levels of norm 
the federal water pollution control act  as amended  and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the epa or applicable state agencies 
many of our domestic properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and or storm water  and we have a system for securing and maintaining these permits 
in addition  the oil pollution act of  as amended  or opa  imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages  including natural resource damages  resulting from such spills in waters of the united states 
a responsible party includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel  or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located 
the federal water pollution control act and analogous state laws provide for administrative  civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and  together with the opa  impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning  as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges 
a certain portion of our rental tools and services business supports other contractors actually performing hydraulic fracturing to enhance the production of natural gas from formations with low permeability  such as shales 
due to concerns raised concerning potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing and disposal of fracturing fluids on groundwater quality  legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated in the united states to render permitting  public disclosure and construction and operational compliance requirements for our oil and gas industry customers more stringent for hydraulic fracturing 
while hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated in the united states by state oil and natural gas commissions  there have been developments indicating that more federal regulatory involvement may occur 
the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act  or sdwa  over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel 
in addition  from time to time  congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the united states under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
at the state level  several states have adopted or are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
in the event that new or more stringent federal or state legal restrictions relating to use of the hydraulic fracturing process in the united states are adopted in areas where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate  those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with requirements relating to permitting  construction  financial assurance  monitoring  recordkeeping  and or plugging and abandonment  as well as could experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities  which could reduce demand for our rental tools and services business 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition  certain domestic governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices  and a committee of the united states house of representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with initial results expected to be available by late and final results by moreover  the epa is planning to develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on the results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms  which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by exploration and production operations  some of which are our customers  and thus reduce demand for our north american completion products and services  tubular services and accommodations services 
in april  there was a fire and explosion aboard the deepwater horizon drilling rig leading to an oil spill from the macondo well operated in the ultra deep water in the us gulf of mexico 
in response to the explosion and spill  there have been many proposals by governmental and private constituencies to address the direct impact of the incident and to prevent similar incidents in the future 
beginning in may  the us department of the interior  initially through its federal minerals management service  or mms  and subsequently through the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement  or boemre  when the mms was renamed the boemre in june  implemented a moratorium on certain deepwater drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico that effectively shut down deepwater drilling activities until the moratorium was lifted by secretary of the interior ken salazar in october while the moratorium was in place  the boemre began issuing a series of notices to lessees and operators  or ntls  imposing additional safety  permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration  development and production activities in the us gulf of mexico  and has delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow water areas 
even with the lifting of the moratorium  offshore drilling activity has been delayed by adjustments in operating procedures  compliance certifications  and lead times for permits and inspections  as a result of the changes in the regulatory environment 
moreover  effective october   boemre was split into two federal bureaus  the bureau of ocean energy management  or boem  which handles offshore leasing  resource evaluation  review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans  renewable energy development  national environmental policy act analysis and environmental studies  and the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement  or bsee  which is responsible for the safety and enforcement functions of offshore oil and gas operations  including the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations  permitting of offshore exploration  development and production activities  inspections  offshore regulatory programs  oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs 
consequently  after october   some of our customers are required to interact with two newly formed federal bureaus to obtain approval of exploration and development plans and issuance of drilling permits  which may result in added plan approval or drilling permit delays as the functions of the former boemre are fully divested from the former agency and implemented in the two new federal bureaus 
in addition to the drilling restrictions and new safety and permitting measures already issued by the boemre  there have been a variety of proposals to change existing laws and regulations that could affect offshore development and production  including proposals to significantly increase the minimum financial responsibility demonstration required under opa 
uncertainties and delays caused by the new regulatory environment have and will continue to have an overall negative effect on gulf of mexico drilling activity and  to a certain extent  our financial results 
some of our operations as well as those of our oil and natural gas customers in the us also result in emissions of regulated air pollutants 
the federal clean air act  as amended  or caa  and analogous state laws require permits for facilities in the united states that have the potential to emit substances into the atmosphere that could adversely affect environmental quality 
failure to obtain a permit or to comply with permit requirements could result in the imposition of substantial administrative  civil and even criminal penalties 
in addition  amendment of the caa or comparable state laws may cause our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers to incur capital expenditures for installation of air pollution control equipment and to

index to financial statements encounter construction delays while applying for and receiving new or amended permits  which could have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services 
for example  on july   the epa proposed a range of new regulations that would establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production  including  among other things  the application of reduced emission completion techniques  referred to as green completions  for completion of newly drilled and fractured wells in addition to establishing specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors  dehydrators  storage tanks and other production equipment 
final action on the proposed rules is expected no later than april  past scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases  or ghg  and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
in response to such studies  many foreign nations  including canada  have agreed to limit emissions of these gases pursuant to the united nations framework convention on climate change  also known as the kyoto protocol 
in december  canada ratified the kyoto protocol  which requires canada to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases to below levels by the canadian federal government previously released the regulatory framework for air emissions  updated march  by turning the corner regulatory framework for industrial greenhouse emissions collectively  the regulatory framework for regulating ghg emissions and in doing so proposed mandatory emissions intensity reduction obligations on a sector by sector basis 
recently  the government of canada has announced a number of regulatory changes to address ghg emissions from motor vehicles and coal fired electricity generation 
these changes may have implications for our costs of operations 
on january   canada affirmed its desire to be associated with the copenhagen accord that was negotiated in december as part of the international meetings on climate change regulation in copenhagen 
the copenhagen accord  which is not legally binding  allows countries to commit to specific efforts to reduce ghg emissions  although how and when the commitments may be converted into binding emission reduction obligations is currently uncertain 
pursuant to the copenhagen accord process  canada has indicated an economy wide ghg emissions target that equates to a per cent reduction from levels by  and the canadian federal government has also indicated an objective of reducing overall canadian ghg emissions by to by additionally  in  the canadian federal government announced its commitment to work with the provincial governments to implement a north america wide cap and trade system for ghg emissions  in cooperation with the united states 
under the system  canada would have a cap and trade market for canadian specific industrial sectors that could be integrated into a north american market for carbon permits 
it is uncertain whether either federal ghg regulations or an integrated north american cap and trade system will be implemented  or what obligations might be imposed under any such systems 
additionally  ghg regulation can take place at the provincial and municipal level 
for example  alberta introduced the climate change and emissions management act  which provides a framework for managing ghg emissions by reducing specified gas emissions  relative to gross domestic product  to an amount that is equal to or less than of levels by december  the accompanying regulation  the specified gas emitters regulation  effective july   requires mandatory emissions reductions through the use of emissions intensity targets  and a company can meet the applicable emissions limits by making emissions intensity improvements at facilities  offsetting ghg emissions by purchasing offset credits or emission performance credits in the open market  or acquiring fund credits by making payments of per ton of ghg emissions to the alberta climate change and management fund 
the specified gas reporting regulation imposes ghg emissions reporting requirements if a company has ghg emissions of  tons or more from a facility in a year 
in addition  alberta facilities must currently report emissions of industrial air pollutants and comply with obligations in permits and under other environmental regulations 
the canadian federal government currently proposes to enter into equivalency agreements with provinces to establish a consistent regulatory regime for ghgs  but the success of any such plan is uncertain  possibly leaving overlapping levels of regulation 
the direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect our operations and financial results as well as those of our customers 
our australian accommodations businesss is regulated by general statutory environmental controls at both the state and federal level 
these controls include the regulation of hard and liquid waste  including the requirement for tradewaste and or wastewater permits or licences  the regulation of water  noise  heat  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements atmospheric gases emissions  the regulation of the production  transport and storage of dangerous and hazardous materials including asbestos  and the regulation of pollution and site contamination 
some specified activities  for example  sewage treatment works  may require regulation at a state level by way of environmental protection licenses which also impose monitoring and reporting obligations on the holder 
there is an increasing emphasis from state and federal regulators on sustainability in business operations 
federal requirements are now in place for the mandatory disclosure of energy performance under building rating schemes 
these schemes require the tracking of specific environmental performance factors 
carbon reporting requirements currently exist for corporations which meet a reporting threshold for greenhouse gases or energy use or production for a reporting financial year under national legislation 
in addition  the australian commonwealth government s carbon pricing mechanism cpm commences on july under the cpm  entities that are responsible for facilities that meet specified emissions thresholds will be required to purchase and surrender permits representing their carbon emissions 
the cpm is intended to operate as a carbon trading scheme  commencing with a three year fixed price period  followed by a flexible price cap and trade emissions trading scheme 
although our australian accommodations facilities are currently below the emissions thresholds specified by the cpm and are  thus  not affected by the cpm  this could change in the future and the resultant change could have an adverse effect on our australian operations and financial results 
although the united states is not participating in the kyoto protocol  the us epa determined in december that emissions of ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment 
based on these findings  the epa has adopted regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the caa  including one that requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources 
the epa has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states  including  among others  offshore and onshore oil and natural gas production facilities  on an annual basis 
in addition  the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs 
the adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs  such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems  to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements 
any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming  and thereby reduce demand for  the oil and natural gas  which could reduce the demand for our products and services 
consequently  legislation and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  floods and other climatic events 
if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations outside of the united states are potentially subject to similar foreign governmental controls relating to protection of the environment 
we believe that  to date  our operations outside of the united states have been in substantial compliance with existing requirements of these foreign governmental bodies and that such compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  this trend of compliance with existing requirements may not continue in the future or the cost of such compliance may become material 
for instance  any future restrictions on emissions of greenhouse gases that are imposed in foreign countries in which we operate  such as in canada and australia  pursuant to the kyoto protocol or other international or locally enforceable requirements  could adversely affect demand for our services 
the federal endangered species act  as amended  or the esa  restricts activities in the united states that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats 
if endangered species are located in areas of the united states where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate  such operations could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required 
moreover  as a result of a settlement approved by the us district court for the district of columbia on september   the us fish and wildlife service 
table of contents 
index to financial statements is required to make a determination on listing of more than species as endangered or threatened under the esa over the next six years  through the agency s fiscal year 
the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas of the united states where our customers oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are conducted could cause them to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities  which could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and services 
item a 
risk factors the risks described in this annual report on form k are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or future results 
our business is subject to a number of economic risks 
financial markets worldwide experienced extreme disruption in the past four years  including  among other things  extreme volatility in securities prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
governments took unprecedented actions intended to address extreme market conditions such as severely restricted credit and declines in real estate values 
such economic events can recur and can potentially affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways 
tightening of credit in financial markets and a slowing economy adversely affects the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant operations  can result in lower demand for our products and services  and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders included in our backlog and adversely affect the collectability of our receivables 
additionally  tightening of credit in financial markets coupled with a slowing economy could negatively impact our cost of capital and ability to grow 
our business is also adversely affected when energy demand declines as a result of lower overall economic activity 
typically  lower energy demand negatively affects commodity prices  which reduces the earnings and cash flow of our e p and mining customers  reducing their spending and demand for our products and services 
these conditions could have an adverse effect on our operating results and our ability to recover our assets at their stated values 
likewise  our suppliers may be unable to sustain their current level of operations  fulfill their commitments and or fund future operations and obligations  each of which could adversely affect our operations 
strengthening of the rate of exchange for the us dollar against certain major currencies  such as the euro  the british pound and the canadian and australian dollar  could also adversely affect our results 
decreased customer expenditure levels will adversely affect our results of operations 
demand for our products and services is sensitive to the level of exploration  development and production activity of  and the corresponding capital spending by  oil and gas and mining companies  including national oil companies 
if our customers expenditures decline  our business will suffer 
the oil and gas and mining industries willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive drilling prospects and the prevailing view of future commodity prices 
prices for oil  coal  natural gas  and other minerals are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty  and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
a sudden or long term decline in commodity pricing would have material adverse effects on our results of operations 
any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress levels of exploration  development  and production activity  often reflected as reductions in rig counts or coal production 
additionally  significant new regulatory requirements  including climate change legislation  could have an impact on the demand for and the cost of producing oil  coal and gas 
many factors affect the supply and demand for oil  coal  natural gas and other minerals and  therefore  influence product prices  including the level of drilling activity  the level of production  the levels of oil and natural gas inventories  depletion rates  worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the expected cost of finding  developing and producing new reserves  delays in major offshore and onshore oil and natural gas field development timetables  the level of activity and developments in the canadian oil sands  the level of demand for coal and other natural resources from australia  the availability of attractive oil and natural gas field prospects  which may be affected by governmental actions or environmental activists which may restrict drilling  the availability of transportation infrastructure  refining capacity and shifts in end customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas  global weather conditions and natural disasters  worldwide economic activity including growth in underdeveloped countries  such as china and india  national government political requirements  including the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting companies opec to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil and government policies which could nationalize or expropriate oil and natural gas exploration  production  refining or transportation assets  the level of oil and gas production by non opec countries  the impact of armed hostilities involving one or more oil producing nations  rapid technological change and the timing and extent of alternative energy sources  including liquefied natural gas lng or other alternative fuels  environmental regulation  and domestic and foreign tax policies 
our business may be adversely affected by extended periods of low oil prices or unsuccessful exploration results may decrease deepwater exploration and production activity or oil sands development and production in canada 
two of our businesses  where we manufacture offshore products for deepwater exploration and production and where we supply accommodations for oil sands developments  typically support our customers projects that are more capital intensive and take longer to generate first production than traditional oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
the economic analyses conducted by exploration and production companies in deepwater  oil sands  australian mining and lng investment areas have historically assumed a relatively conservative longer term price outlook for production from such projects to determine economic viability 
perceptions of lower longer term oil prices by these companies can cause our customers to reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability in our offshore products segment and our accommodations segment 
federal legislation and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect our services 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in formations with low permeabilities  such as shale formations  and involves the pressurized injection of water  sand and chemicals into rock formations to stimulate production 
due to concerns raised concerning potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality  legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated in the united states to render permitting  public disclosure and construction and operational compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing

these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms  which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by exploration and production operations  some of which are our customers  and thus reduce demand for our north american completion products and services 
in our accommodations business supporting mining  our clients production or price issues may adversely affect us 
the volumes and prices of the products of our clients  including coal and gold  have historically varied significantly and are difficult to predict 
the demand for  and price of  these minerals and commodities is highly dependent on a variety of factors  including international supply and demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  actions taken by governments and global economic and political developments 
mineral and commodity prices have fluctuated in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
we expect that a material decline in mineral and commodity prices could result in a decrease in the activity of our clients with the possibility that this would materially adversely affect us 
no assurance can be given regarding future volumes and or prices relating to the activities of our clients 
our customers in the accommodations business are exposed to a number of unique operating risks which could also adversely affect us 
we could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to the operation of our clients caused by any one of or all of the following singularly or in combination domestic and international pricing and demand for the natural resource being produced at a given project or proposed project  unexpected problems and delays during the development  construction and project start up which may delay the commencement of production  unforeseen and adverse climatic  geological  geotechnical  seismic and mining conditions  lack of availability of sufficient water or power to maintain their or our operations  water or food quality or safety issues  lack of availability or failure of the required infrastructure necessary to maintain or to expand their operations  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the breakdown or shortage of equipment and labor necessary to maintain their or our operations  risks associated with the natural resources industry being subject to various regulatory approvals 
such risks may include a government agency failing to grant an approval or failing to renew an existing approval  or the approval or renewal not being provided by the government agency in a timely manner or the government agency granting or renewing an approval subject to materially onerous conditions  risks to land titles  mining titles and use thereof as a result of native title claims  claims by persons living in close proximity to mining projects  which may have an impact on the consents granted  interruptions to the operations of our clients caused by industrial accidents or disputes  and delays in or failure to commission new infrastructure in timeframes so as not to disrupt client operations 
our accommodations business is exposed to a number of general risks that could materially adversely affect our assets and liabilities  financial position  profits  prospects and share price 
examples of these broad general risks which may impact our performance include abnormal stoppages in the production or delivery of the products of our clients due to factors such as industrial disruption  infrastructure failure  war  political or civil unrest  cost overruns in the provision of new rooms or in other associated or related capital expenditure  higher than budgeted costs associated with the provision of accommodations services  our clients not renewing their contracts  renewing them on less favorable terms  or other loss of clients  our inability to properly treat and dispose of wastewater at our facilities  failure of our clients to meet their obligations under their contracts  extreme weather conditions adversely affecting our operations or the operations of our clients  and a major disaster at one or more of our large accommodations facilities involving fire  communicable diseases  criminal acts or other events causing significant reputational damage 
development of permanent infrastructure in the canadian oil sands region  regions of australia or various us locations where we locate our accommodations assets could negatively impact our accommodations business 
our accommodations business specializes in providing housing and personnel logistics for work forces in remote areas which lack the infrastructure typically available in nearby towns and cities 
if permanent towns  cities and municipal infrastructure develop in the oil sands region of northern alberta  canada  or regions of australia where we locate accommodations villages demand for our accommodations could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services 
construction risks exist in our accommodations business 
there are a number of general risks that might impinge on companies involved in the development  construction  manufacture and installation of facilities as a prerequisite to the management of those assets in an operational sense 
we might be exposed to these risks from time to time by relying on these corporations and or other third parties which could include any and or all of the following  the construction activities of our accommodations business are partially dependent on the supply of appropriate construction and development opportunities  development approvals  slow decision making by counterparties  complex construction specifications  changes to design briefs  legal issues and other documentation changes may give rise to delays in completion  loss of revenue and cost over runs 
delays in completion may  in turn  result in termination of accommodation supply contracts  
table of contents 
index to financial statements other time delays that may arise in relation to construction and development include supply of labor  scarcity of construction materials  lower than expected productivity levels  inclement weather conditions  land contamination  cultural heritage claims  difficult site access  or industrial relations issues  objections aired by community interest  environment and or neighborhood groups which may cause delays in the granting or approvals and or the overall progress of a project  where we assume design responsibility  there is a risk that design problems or defects may result in rectification and or costs or liabilities which we cannot readily recover  and there is a risk that we may fail to fulfill our statutory and contractual obligations in relation to the quality of our materials and workmanship  including warranties and defect liability obligations 
our financial results could be adversely impacted by changes in the regulation of offshore oil and natural gas exploration and development activity as a result of the macondo well incident 
the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemre has issued a series of notices to lessees and operators ntls  has imposed additional safety  permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration  development and production activities in the us gulf of mexico  and has delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow water areas 
uncertainties and delays caused by the new regulatory environment have and will continue to have an overall negative effect on gulf of mexico drilling activity  and to a certain extent  our financial results 
in addition to the drilling restrictions and new safety and permitting measures already issued by the boemre  there have been a variety of proposals to change existing laws and regulations that could affect offshore development and production  including proposals to significantly increase the minimum financial responsibility demonstration required under the oil pollution act of any increased regulation of the exploration and production industry as a whole that arises out of the macondo well incident could result in fewer companies being financially qualified to operate offshore in the us  could result in higher operating costs for our customers and could reduce demand for our services 
we have a significant concentration of our accommodations business located in the oil sands region of alberta  canada and in the bowen basin of queensland  australia 
because of the concentration of our accommodations business in the canadian oil sands and in the coal region of queensland  australia  two relatively small geographic areas  we have increased exposure to political  regulatory  environmental  labor  climate or natural disaster events or developments that could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
because the oil and gas industry is cyclical  our operating results may fluctuate 
oil and natural gas prices have been and are expected to remain volatile 
this volatility causes oil and gas companies and drilling contractors to change their strategies and expenditure levels 
supplies of oil and natural gas can be influenced by many factors  including improved technology such as the hydraulic fracturing of horizontally drilled wells in shale discoveries  access to potential productive regions and availability of required infrastructure to deliver production to the marketplace 
we have experienced in the past  and expect to experience in the future  significant fluctuations in operating results based on these changes 
the cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn could negatively affect the value of our goodwill 
as of december   goodwill represented approximately of our total assets 
we have recorded goodwill because we paid more for some of our businesses that we acquired than the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets of those businesses 
current accounting standards  which were effective january   require a periodic review of goodwill for impairment in value and a non cash charge against earnings with a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity if circumstances  some of which are beyond our control  indicate that the carrying amount will not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of

similarly  in the second quarter of  we recognized an impairment of million representing a portion of our remaining goodwill as a result of several factors affecting our rental tools and services reporting unit 
it is possible that we could recognize additional goodwill impairment losses in the future if  among other factors global economic conditions deteriorate  the outlook for future profits and cash flow for any of our reporting units deteriorate as the result of many possible factors  including  but not limited to  increased or unanticipated competition  technology becoming obsolete  further reductions in customer capital spending plans  loss of key personnel  adverse legal or regulatory judgment s  future operating losses at a reporting unit  downward forecast revisions  or restructuring plans  costs of equity or debt capital increase further  or valuations for comparable public companies or comparable acquisition valuations deteriorate further 
the level and pricing of tubular goods imported into the united states could decrease demand for our tubular goods inventory and adversely impact our results of operations 
also  if steel mills were to sell a substantial amount of goods directly to end users in the united states  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
although imports of octg from china are currently restricted by trade sanctions imposed by the us government  lower priced tubular goods from a number of foreign countries are still imported into the us tubular goods market 
if the level of imported lower priced tubular goods were to otherwise increase from current levels  our tubular services segment could be adversely affected to the extent that we would then have higher cost tubular goods in inventory or if prices and margins are driven down by increased supplies of tubular goods 
if prices were to decrease significantly  we might not be able to profitably sell our inventory of tubular goods 
in addition  significant price decreases could result in a longer holding period for some of our inventory  which could also have an adverse effect on our tubular services segment 
we do not manufacture any of the tubular goods that we distribute 
historically  users of tubular goods in the united states  in contrast to those outside the united states  have purchased tubular goods through distributors 
if customers were to purchase tubular goods directly from steel mills  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we do business in international jurisdictions whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the united states 
a portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries 
these activities accounted for approximately excluding canada of our consolidated revenue in the year ended december  risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include  but are not limited to war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation  confiscation or nationalization of assets  renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts  foreign exchange restrictions  foreign currency fluctuations  foreign taxation  the inability to repatriate earnings or capital  changing political conditions  changing foreign and domestic monetary policies

additionally  in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
these regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete 
our international business operations also include projects in countries where governmental corruption has been known to exist and where our competitors who are not subject to the same ethics related laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act in the us and the bribery act in the us  can gain competitive advantages over us by securing business awards  licenses or other preferential treatment in those jurisdictions using methods that certain ethics related laws and regulations prohibit us from using 
for example  our non us competitors may not be subject to the anti bribery restrictions of the foreign corrupt practices act  which make it illegal to give anything of value to foreign officials or employees or agents of nationally owned oil companies in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage 
while many countries  like the us and the uk  have adopted anti bribery statutes  there has not been universal adoption and enforcement of such statutes 
therefore  we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence 
violations of these laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and  therefore  our ability to do business 
we are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations 
all of our operations are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign  federal  provincial  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
we could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of  or conditions caused by  prior operators or other third parties 
environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future  possibly resulting in more stringent requirements 
if existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or are more stringently enforced  we may be required to make significant unanticipated capital and operating expenditures 
any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition  including the issuance of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations  reduction or cessation in operations  and performance of site investigatory  remedial or other corrective actions 
we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 
climate change is receiving increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike 
the debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing  the potential causes of this change and its potential impacts 
some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
a significant focus is being made on companies that are active producers of depleting natural resources 

table of contents 
index to financial statements there are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions  which are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
the outcome of foreign  us federal  regional  provincial and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities  or other regulatory actions 
these actions could result in increased costs associated with our operations and our customers operations  increase other costs to our business  adversely impact overall drilling activity in the areas in which we operate  reduce the demand for carbon based fuels  and reduce the demand for our services 
any adoption of these or similar proposals by foreign  us federal  regional or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and implementation of the kyoto protocol the copenhagen accord  or other foreign  us federal  regional or state requirements or other efforts to regulate greenhouse gas emissions  could have far reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our services 
see item government regulation for a more detailed description of our climate change related risks 
currently proposed legislative changes  including changes to tax laws and regulations  could materially  negatively impact the company  increase the costs of doing business and decrease the demand for our products 
the current us administration and congress have proposed several new articles of legislation or legislative and administration changes  including changes to tax laws and regulations  which could have a material negative effect on our company 
some of the proposed changes that could negatively impact us are cap and trade system for emissions  increase environmental limits on exploration and production activities  repeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs  increase of the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs to seven years  repeal of percentage depletion  limits on hydraulic fracturing or disposal of hydraulic fracturing fluids  repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction for oil and natural gas production  repeal of the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and natural gas properties  repeal of the credits for enhanced oil recovery projects and production from marginal wells  repeal of the deduction for tertiary injectants  changes to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation  and changes to healthcare rules and regulations 
we are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations 
our operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate  most notably in canada  australia  the rocky mountain region and the gulf of mexico 
a portion of our canadian accommodations operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote 
table of contents 
index to financial statements regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur 
the spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and  as a result  adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services in the second and  to a lesser extent  third quarters 
during the australian rainy season  generally between the months of november and april  our accommodations operations in queensland and the northern parts of western australia can be affected by cyclones  monsoons and resultant flooding 
severe winter weather conditions in the rocky mountain region can restrict access to work areas for our well site services and accommodations segment operations 
our operations in the gulf of mexico are also affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions in the gulf coast region generally result in higher drilling activity in the spring  summer and fall months with the lowest activity in the winter months 
as a result of these seasonal differences  full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters 
in addition  summer and fall drilling activity can be restricted due to hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the gulf of mexico and along the gulf coast 
for example  during  a significant disruption occurred in oil and natural gas drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico due to damage inflicted by hurricanes katrina and rita and  during  from hurricane ike 
cyclones can affect our operations in australia 
we are exposed to risk relating to subcontractors performance in some of our projects 
in many cases  we subcontract the performance of parts of our operations to subcontractors 
while we seek to obtain appropriate indemnities and guarantees from these subcontractors  we remain ultimately responsible for the performance of our subcontractors 
industrial disputes  natural disasters  financial failure or default or inadequate performance in the provision of services  or the inability to provide services by such subcontractors has the potential to materially adversely affect us 
our inability to control the inherent risks of identifying  acquiring and integrating businesses  including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities  could adversely affect our operations 
acquisitions have been  and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be  a key element of our growth strategy 
we may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future 
we may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions 
such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition 
the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
we expect to gain certain business  financial and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake  including synergies and operating efficiencies 
our forward looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits 
an inability to realize expected strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
additional risks we could face in connection with acquisitions include retaining key employees of acquired businesses  retaining and attracting new customers of acquired businesses  retaining supply and distribution relationships key to the supply chain  increased administrative burden  developing our sales and marketing capabilities  managing our growth effectively  potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition  integrating operations  managing tax and foreign exchange exposure  operating a new line of business  and increased logistical problems common to large  expansive operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements additionally  an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced 
if we fail to manage any of these risks successfully  our business could be harmed 
our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition  and shareholders of the company may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic  financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions 
we may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities 
our operations are subject to many hazards 
we face the following risks under our insurance coverage we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms  we may be faced with types of liabilities that will not be covered by our insurance  such as damages from environmental contamination or terrorist attacks  the dollar amount of any liabilities may exceed our policy limits  the counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks  and we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage 
even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim  if successful and of significant size  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position 
we are subject to litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance 
in the ordinary course of business  we become the subject of various claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations  products  employees and other matters  including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations 
some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have sold  and some relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired  even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses 
we maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses  and we are subject to various self retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies 
it is possible  however  that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
our concentration of customers in two industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk 
the majority of our customers operate in the energy or mining industries 
this concentration of customers in two industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables 
our common stock price has been volatile 
the market price of common stock of companies engaged in the oil and gas services industry has been highly volatile 
likewise  the market price of our common stock has varied significantly low of per share  high of per share in the past  and we expect it to continue to remain highly volatile given the cyclical nature of our industry 
we may assume contractual risk in developing  manufacturing and delivering products in our offshore products business segment 
many of our products from our offshore products segment are ordered by customers under frame agreements or project specific contracts 
in some cases these contracts stipulate a fixed price for the delivery of our products and impose liquidated damages or late delivery fees if we do not meet specific customer deadlines 
in addition  some customer contracts stipulate consequential damages payable  generally as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct 
the final delivered products may also include customer and third party supplied equipment  the delay of which can negatively impact our ability to deliver our products on time at our anticipated profitability 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in certain cases these orders include new technology or unspecified design elements 
in some cases we may not be fully or properly compensated for the cost to develop and design the final products  negatively impacting our profitability on the projects 
in addition  our customers  in many cases  request changes to the original design or bid specifications for which we may not be fully or properly compensated 
as is customary for our offshore products segment  we agree to provide products under fixed price contracts  typically assuming responsibility for cost overruns 
our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed price contracts may vary from the initially expected contract economics 
there is inherent risk in the estimation process including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times 
a fixed price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices including the price of steel through increased pricing 
in fulfilling some contracts  we provide limited warranties for our products 
although we estimate and record a provision for potential warranty claims  repair or replacement costs under warranty provisions in our contracts could exceed the estimated cost to cure the claim which could be material to our financial results 
we utilize percentage completion accounting  depending on the size of a project and variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our reported operating results as we progress toward completion of major jobs 
our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is  therefore  an imperfect indicator of our future revenues and earnings 
the revenues projected in our offshore products segment backlog may not be realized or  if realized  may not result in profits 
because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers projects  we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized 
in addition  even where a project proceeds as scheduled  it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us 
material delays  cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
reductions in our backlog due to cancellations by customers or for other reasons would adversely affect  potentially to a material extent  the revenues and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog 
some of the contracts in our backlog are cancelable by the customer  subject to the payment of termination fees and or the reimbursement of our costs incurred 
we typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog once a project is cancelled 
if we experience significant project terminations  suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts included in our backlog  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted 
we might be unable to employ a sufficient number of technical personnel 
many of the products that we sell  especially in our offshore products segment  are complex and highly engineered and often must perform in harsh conditions 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to employ and retain technical personnel with the ability to design  utilize and enhance these products 
in addition  our ability to expand our operations depends in part on our ability to increase our skilled labor force 
during periods of increased activity  the demand for skilled workers is high  and the supply is limited 
we have already experienced high demand and increased wages for labor forces serving our accommodations business in canada and australia 
when these events occur  our cost structure increases and our growth potential could be impaired 
we might be unable to compete successfully with other companies in our industry 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and certain of them have relatively few barriers to entry 
the principal competitive factors in our markets are product  equipment and service quality  availability  responsiveness  experience  technology  safety performance and price 
in some of our business segments  we compete with the oil and gas industry s largest oilfield service providers 
these large national and multi national companies have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do 
several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets 
in addition  we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements 
some contracts are awarded on a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements bid basis  which further increases competition based on price 
as a result of competition  we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not develop new competitive technologies and products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
the market for our offshore products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better performance in increasingly greater water depths  higher pressure levels and harsher conditions 
if we are not able to design  develop and produce commercially competitive products in a timely manner in response to changes in technology  our business and revenues will be adversely affected 
in addition  competitors or customers may develop new technologies  which address similar or improved solutions to our existing technology 
should our technologies  particularly in offshore products or in our rental tools and services business  become the less attractive solution  our operations and profitability would be negatively impacted 
during periods of strong demand  we may be unable to obtain critical project materials on a timely basis 
our operations depend on our ability to procure  on a timely basis  certain project materials  such as forgings  to complete projects in an efficient manner 
our inability to procure critical materials during times of strong demand could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
our oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses 
our operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the oilfield business 
these include  but are not limited to  equipment defects  blowouts  explosions  fires  collisions  capsizing and severe weather conditions 
these hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards as part of our ongoing business operations 
we may agree to indemnify our customers against specific risks and liabilities 
while we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks  and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks  our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective enough to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks 
the occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we were to lose a significant supplier of our tubular goods  we could be adversely affected 
during  we purchased of our total tubular goods from a single domestic supplier and of our total octg purchases were from three suppliers 
if we were to lose any of these suppliers or if production at one or more of the suppliers was interrupted  our tubular services segment s business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if the extent of the loss or interruption were sufficiently large  the impact on us could be material 
our operations may suffer due to increased industry wide capacity of certain types of equipment or assets 
the demand for and pricing of certain types of our assets and equipment  particularly our accommodations assets  drilling rigs and rental tool assets  is subject to the overall availability of such assets in the marketplace 
if demand for our assets were to decrease  or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our fleets in excess of current demand  we may encounter decreased pricing for or utilization of our assets and services  which could adversely impact our operations and profits 
in addition  we have significantly increased our accommodations capacity in the oil sands region over the past six years and in australia over the past year based on our expectation for current and future customer demand for accommodations in these areas 
should our customers build their own facilities to meet their accommodations needs or our competitors likewise increase their available accommodations  or activity in the oil sands or australia declines significantly  demand and or pricing for our accommodations could decrease  negatively impacting the profitability of our accommodations segment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we might be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our offshore products and well site services segments  particularly our patents relating to our flexjoint and merlin technology and intervention tools utilized in the completion or workover of oil and natural gas wells 
the market success of our technologies will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and enforce our proprietary rights in these technologies  to preserve rights in our trade secret and non public information  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
if any of our patents or other intellectual property rights are determined to be invalid or unenforceable  or if a court limits the scope of claims in a patent or fails to recognize our trade secret rights  our competitive advantages could be significantly reduced in the relevant technology  allowing competition for our customer base to increase 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the failure of our company to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could adversely affect our competitive position 
loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of management 
if any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
we do not maintain key man life insurance for any of our officers 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers and other counterparties  and a general increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by counterparties could have an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties are a concern in our business 
we are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers and other counterparties  such as our lenders and insurers 
many of our customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
in connection with the recent economic downturn  commodity prices declined sharply  and the credit markets and availability of credit were constrained 
additionally  many of our customers equity values declined substantially 
the combination of lower cash flow due to commodity prices  a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve based credit facilities and the lack of available debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our customers liquidity and ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations to us 
furthermore  some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks  which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us 
any increase in the nonpayment and nonperformance by our counterparties could have an adverse impact on our operating results and could adversely affect our liquidity 
employee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us 
we are party to collective bargaining agreements covering  employees in canada  employees in australia  employees in the united kingdom and employees in argentina 
in addition  our accommodations facilities serving oil sands development work in northern alberta  canada and mining operations in australia house both union and non union customer employees 
we have not experienced strikes  work stoppages or other slowdowns in the recent past  but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future 
a prolonged strike  work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board  limitations on the removal of directors  on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us  which may reduce or eliminate our stockholders ability to sell their shares of common stock at a premium
