the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included below in item and risk factors included above in item a of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview astrotech was formed in to leverage the environment of space for commercial purposes 
for nearly years  the company has remained a crucial player in space commerce activities 
we have supported the launch of shuttle missions and more than spacecraft  built space hardware and processing facilities  constructed and operated world class processing facilities  and prepared and processed scientific research for microgravity 
our efforts are focused on providing world class facilities and related support services necessary for the preparation of satellites and payloads 
providing satellite and payload processing and integration service and support 
designing  fabricating and utilizing equipment and hardware for launch activities 
supplying propellant and associated services for spacecraft 
managing launch logistics and support 
commercializing unique space based technologies 
our business units astrotech space operations aso aso provides support for its government and commercial customers to successfully process complex communication  earth observation and deep space satellites in preparation for their launch on a variety of launch vehicles 
processing activities include satellite ground transportation  pre launch hardware integration and testing  satellite encapsulation  fueling  launch pad delivery  and communication linked launch control 
our aso facilities can accommodate five meter class satellites encompassing the majority of us based satellite preparation services 
aso s service capabilities include designing and building spacecraft processing equipment and facilities 
additionally  aso provides propellant services including designing  building and testing propellant service equipment for servicing spacecraft 
aso accounted for of our consolidated revenues for the year ended june  revenue for our aso business unit is generated primarily from various fixed priced contracts with launch service providers in both the government and commercial markets and from design and fabrication of space launch equipment 
the services and facilities we provide to our customers support the final assembly  checkout  and countdown functions associated with preparing a spacecraft for launch 
the revenue and cash flows generated from our aso operations are primarily related to the number of spacecraft launches and the fabrication of the gse for the us government 
other factors that have impacted  and are expected to continue to impact earnings and cash flows for this business include the continuing limited availability of competing facilities at the major domestic launch sites that can offer comparable services  leading to an increase in government and commercial use of our services 
our ability to design and fabricate spacecraft preparation and processing equipment 
our ability to control our capital expenditures  which are primarily limited to modifications required to accommodate payload processing for new launch vehicles and upgrading building infrastructure 
our ability to complete customer specified facility modifications within budgeted costs and time commitments 
spacetech our other business unit is a technology incubator designed to commercialize space industry technologies 
this business unit it currently pursuing two distinct opportunities st detect st detect designs  manufactures and sells miniature mass spectrometer equipment 
st detect launched the mms tm during march the mms tm is a low power  miniature mass spectrometer device designed initially for the laboratory testing market 
the unique design of this unit is the result of the company s work with national aeronautics and space administration nasa on the international space station 
st detect has been awarded a developmental testing and evaluation designation from the us department of homeland security as a promising anti terrorism technology  and is the recipient of a phase i and phase ii award from the us army s chemical and biological defense cbd small business innovation research sbir program 
following the successful execution of the phase i sbir  st detect was awarded a million phase ii sbir contract from the joint science and technology office for chemical and biological defense 
additionally  st detect received a million award from the texas emerging technology fund in march astrogenetix astrogenetix is a biotechnology company formed to commercialize products processed in the unique environment of microgravity 
astrogenetix pursued an aggressive space access strategy to take advantage of the space shuttle program prior to its retirement in this strategy gave astrogenetix unprecedented access to research in microgravity  as the company flew experiments twelve times over a three year period 
astrogenetix is currently researching a salmonella vaccine as part of its ongoing commercialization strategy 
concurrently  astrogenetix is evaluating a vaccine target mrsa based on discoveries made in microgravity 
in december  the company negotiated a space act agreement with nasa for a minimum of twenty eight additional space flights 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition astrotech recognizes revenue employing several generally accepted revenue recognition methodologies across its business units 
the methodology used is based on contract type and the manner in which products and services are provided 
revenue generated by astrotech s payload processing facilities is recognized ratably over the occupancy period of the satellite while in the astrotech facilities 
the percentage of completion method is used for all contracts where incurred costs can be reasonably estimated and successful completion can be reasonably assured at inception 
changes in estimated costs to complete and provisions for contract losses are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue for the sale of commercial products is recognized at shipment 
a summary of revenue recognition methods services products provided contract type method of revenue recognition payload processing facilities firm fixed price mission specific ratably  over the occupancy period of a satellite within the facility from arrival through launch construction contracts firm fixed price percentage of completion based on costs incurred engineering services cost reimbursable award fixed fee reimbursable costs incurred plus award fixed fee commercial products specific purchase order based at shipment grant cost reimbursable award as costs are incurred for related research and development expenses under certain contracts  we make expenditures for specific enhancements and or additions to our facilities where the customer agrees to pay a fixed fee to deliver the enhancement or addition 
we account for such agreements as a reduction in the cost of such investments and recognize any excess of amounts collected above the expenditure as revenue 
long lived asset in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  fixed assets  assets under construction and intangible assets  we evaluate the recoverability of those assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents amounts collected from customers for projects  products  or services expected to be provided at a future date 
deferred revenue is shown on the balance sheet as either a short term or long term liability  depending on when the service or product is expected to be provided 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based awards to employees based on the fair value of the award on the grant date 
the fair value of the stock options is estimated using expected dividend yields of the company s stock  the expected volatility of the stock  the expected length of time the options remain outstanding and risk free interest rates 
changes in one or more of these factors may significantly affect the estimated fair value of the stock options 
additionally  the company estimates the number of instruments for which the required service is expected to be rendered 
the company estimates forfeitures using historical forfeiture rates for previous grants of equity instruments 
the fair value of awards that are expected to vest is recorded as an expense over the vesting period 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest accounting is applied for any entities where the company maintains more than and less than ownership 
the company clearly identifies the noncontrolling interest in the balance sheets and income statements 
we also disclose three measures of net income loss net income loss  net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest  and net income loss attributable to astrotech corporation 
our operating cash flows in our consolidated statements of cash flows reflect net income loss  while our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations reflect net income loss attributable to astrotech corporation 
state of texas funding the company accounts for the state of texas funding in the amount of million in its majority owned subsidiary st detect as a contribution of capital and has reflected the disbursement in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
while the award agreement includes both a common stock purchase right and a note payable to the state of texas  the economic substance of the transaction is that the state of texas has purchased shares of st detect in exchange for the granted award 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
as of june   the company has established a full valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax assets 
fasb asc  income taxes fasb asc addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the company has an unrecognized tax benefit of million for the years ended june  and for the year ended june  and  the company s effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to recording changes to the valuation allowance placed against its net deferred tax assets 
the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and in various states 
due to the company s loss carryover position  it is subject to us federal and state income tax examination adjustments to its carryover benefits generated after currently  the company is under examination by the internal revenue service for its through tax year
