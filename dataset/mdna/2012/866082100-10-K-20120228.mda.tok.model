overview we are a self managed hotel investment company that was organized in june to continue and expand the existing hotel investment business of our predecessor  summit hotel properties  llc  a leading us hotel owner 
we focus on acquiring and owning premium branded select service hotels in the upper midscale and upscale segments of the us lodging industry  as these segments are currently defined by str 
we completed our ipo  a concurrent private placement of our common stock and our formation transactions on february   netting approximately million from the ipo and concurrent private placement  after underwriting discounts and the payment by us of offering related costs 
we had no business activities prior to completion of the ipo and the formation transactions on february  as a result of the formation transactions  we acquired sole ownership of the hotels in our predecessor s portfolio 
in addition  we assumed the indebtedness of our predecessor and its subsidiaries 
our predecessor is considered the acquiror for accounting purposes and its financial statements became our financial statements upon completion of the formation transactions 
since completion of our ipo  we have acquired six hotels with a total of guestrooms located in four states for purchase prices aggregating approximately million

on october   summit reit completed a follow on public offering of  shares of its series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock  in which it raised net proceeds  after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering costs  of approximately million 
the proceeds from this offering were used to pay down the principal balance of our revolving credit facility 
recent developments on january   we purchased of the ownership interests in the unit courtyard by marriott hotel in atlanta  georgia for a purchase price of approximately million  or approximately  per key 
upon expiration of tax credits related to the hotel in approximately four years  we will be able to take assignment of the remaining ownership of the hotel for approximately  we expect to perform a minor renovation of approximately  for a combined purchase price and renovation cost of approximately  per key 
we funded the purchase price of this acquisition through the assumption of a term loan with empire financial with a principal balance of million and the remainder with borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
in connection with this acquisition  we have engaged courtyard management to manage the hotel pursuant to a hotel management agreement 
we own our ownership interest in the courtyard by marriott hotel through one of our trss

industry trends and outlook room night demand in the us lodging industry is correlated to macroeconomic trends 
key drivers of demand include growth in gross domestic product  or gdp  corporate profits  capital investments and employment 
following periods of recession  recovery of room night demand for lodging historically has lagged improvements in the overall economy 
however  in the economic recovery beginning in early  room night demand has led improvements in the overall economy 
pricewaterhousecoopers llp projects revpar growth increases in for upscale hotels  upper midscale hotels and midscale hotels of  and  respectively 
although we expect that our hotels will realize meaningful revpar gains as the economy and lodging industry continue to improve  the risk exists that global economic conditions may cause the united states economic recovery to stall  which likely would adversely affect our growth expectations 
while we are guardedly optimistic about macro economic conditions and their effect on demand for our guestrooms  we feel relatively confident that our near term results will not be adversely affected by increased lodging supply in our markets 
growth in lodging supply typically lags growth in room night demand 
key drivers of lodging supply include the availability and cost of capital  construction costs  local real estate market conditions and availability and pricing of existing properties 
as a result of scarcity of financing  severe recession and declining operating fundamentals during and  many planned hotel developments were cancelled or postponed 
according to lodging econometrics  approximately new hotels with  guestrooms will open during and hotels with  guestrooms will open in this compares to  new hotels with  guestrooms that opened during if the general economy does not continue its recovery for any number of reasons  including  among others  an economic slowdown and other events outside of our control  such as terrorism or significantly increased gasoline prices  lodging industry fundamentals may not improve as expected 
in the past  similar events have adversely affected the lodging industry and if these events recur  they may adversely affect the lodging industry in the future 
operating performance metrics we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy  adr  and revpar 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue depends on demand  as measured by occupancy  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy and revpar performance may be affected by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy and revpar performance is dependent on the continued success of our franchisors and their brands 
seasoned and unseasoned hotel information for our initial portfolio as we disclosed in the prospectus for the ipo  the hotels we acquired from our predecessor in our formation transactions consisted of hotels  of which we considered at the time of our ipo to be seasoned and of which we considered at the time of our ipo to be unseasoned hotels 
at the time of our ipo  we designated hotels as seasoned based on their construction or acquisition date and we designated hotels as unseasoned if they had been built after january  or experienced a brand conversion since january  the following table sets forth various statistical and operating information for the hotels in our initial portfolio at the time of our ipo based on the seasoned and unseasoned designation on a total portfolio basis  and excluding the former choice hotels  and the equivalent information and designations for just the former choice hotels dollars in thousands  except adr and revpar twelve months ended december  percentage change initial portfolio hotels average number of rooms revenue hotel operating expense occupancy adr revpar seasoned hotels occupancy adr revpar seasoned  excluding seven former choice hotels hotels occupancy adr revpar unseasoned hotels occupancy adr revpar unseasoned  excluding four former choice hotels hotels occupancy adr revpar former choice hotels hotels occupancy adr revpar as shown in the table above  revpar for our seasoned hotels  excluding the seven former choice hotels  increased by for the year ended december   compared to the same period in revpar for our unseasoned hotels  excluding the four former choice hotels  increased for the year ended december   compared to the same period in revpar for the hotels in our initial portfolio for the year ended december  was negatively affected by a substantial decrease in revpar for the former choice hotels  driven primarily by substantial decreases in occupancy rates at these hotels 
for the year ended december   revpar for the former choice hotels decreased as compared to decreases in revpar for the former choice hotels primarily resulted from disruptions associated with termination of the franchises and loss of access to national reservations systems pending effectiveness of new franchises 
we believe our unseasoned hotels  excluding the four former choice hotels  have continued to stabilize since their construction or brand conversion during the dramatic economic slowdown beginning in most of these hotels are newer  larger and are located in larger markets than those of our seasoned hotels and operate under premium franchise brands 
as a result  we believe the unseasoned hotels  excluding the four former choice hotels  are particularly well positioned to generate revpar growth for our portfolio as economic conditions improve 
we recognized growth in revpar for the unseasoned hotels  excluding the four former choice hotels  during the twelve months ended december  as compared to because we believe the seasoned unseasoned designation for the hotels in our initial portfolio is becoming less meaningful over time  the discussion that follows in results of operations below is based on the operating results of our total portfolio hotels as of december  and hotels as of december  and our same store portfolio  which consists of the hotels in our initial portfolio for the periods ended december  and we anticipate that we will cease using these designations in future reports 
revenues and expenses our revenue is derived from hotel operations and consists of room revenue and other hotel operations revenue 
as a result of our focus on select service hotels in the upper midscale and upscale segments of the us lodging industry  substantially all of our revenue is room revenue generated from sales of hotel rooms 
we also generate  to a much lesser extent  other hotel operations revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue related to meeting rooms and other guest services provided at our hotels 
our hotel operating expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in the day to day operation of our hotels 
many of our expenses are fixed  such as essential hotel staff  real estate taxes  insurance  depreciation and certain types of franchise fees  and these expenses do not decrease even if the revenue at our hotels decreases 
as reclassified  our hotel operating expenses consist of room expenses wages  payroll taxes and benefits  linens  cleaning and guestroom supplies and complimentary breakfast  other direct expenses office supplies  utilities  telephone  advertising and bad debts  other indirect expenses real and personal property taxes  insurance  travel agent and credit card commissions  hotel management fees and franchise fees  and other expenses ground rent and other items of miscellaneous expense 
results of operations of summit hotel properties  inc and summit hotel op  lp prior to february   the date we completed our ipo  concurrent private placement and formation transactions  neither summit reit nor summit op had any operations other than the issuance of  shares of common stock of summit reit to our executive chairman in connection with summit reit s formation and initial capitalization and activity in connection with the ipo and the formation transactions 
we have therefore set forth a discussion comparing the combined operating results of our operations for the period from february  through december   and the historical results of operations for the period from january  through february  of our predecessor  to the historical results of our predecessor for the twelve months ended december  the historical results of operations presented below should be reviewed in conjunction with the notes to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  income from operations 
income from operations decreased by approximately  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the following tables sets forth key operating metrics for our total portfolio and our same store portfolio for the year ended december  and the year ended december  dollars in thousands  except adr and revpar year ended december  total revenue total hotel operating expenses occupancy adr revpar total portfolio hotels same store portfolio hotels year ended december  total revenue total hotel operating expenses occupancy adr revpar total same store portfolio hotels percentage change total revenue total hotel operating expenses occupancy adr revpar total portfolio and hotels same store portfolio hotels the information in the tables above for our total portfolio for the year ended december  includes revenues and expenses from the five hotels we acquired during the year from the date of acquisition of the hotel through december   and operating information occupancy  adr  and revpar for the hotels for the period in which they were owned by us 
accordingly  the information does not reflect a full twelve months of operations for the hotels acquired in revenue 
total revenue increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to improving economic conditions affecting our markets and leading to continued stabilization of revenue at our unseasoned hotels  and the acquisition of five hotels in the second and third quarters of the increase in revenues occurred despite the significant decrease in revpar at our former choice hotels during the same period as a result of continued disruptions at these hotels associated with termination of the franchises and the loss of access to national reservations systems pending effectiveness of new franchises 
in addition  of the ten hotels operating under new franchise brands  six hotels containing an aggregate of guestrooms are operating under lesser known franchise brands  which provide lower levels of marketing support and guest loyalty programs that may not be as strong as those of the larger brands 
as a result  occupancy  adr  revpar and revenues for these hotels have been adversely affected

the increase in total hotel operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended december  was largely related to the increase in revenue and the acquisition of five hotels during the second and third quarters of in addition  the transition of management of our initial hotels to interstate resulted in an increase in expenses as a percentage of revenue in our hotels 
we amended our management agreement with interstate to address the operational challenges experienced at the hotels during the second quarter  which resulted in a one time  reduction in other indirect hotel operating expenses that would have otherwise been incurred under the management agreement during the period 
the amendment to the hotel management agreement provided interstate the opportunity to earn the  as an additional incentive fee in future periods  which they earned in full during the fourth quarter of the transition in hotel management resulted in approximately million  or a increase  in additional expenses incurred in the twelve months ended december  that were not incurred in the twelve months ended december  we have also incurred expenses related to the franchise conversions of the former choice hotels and renovation expenses related to refranchising such hotels of approximately  during the twelve months ended december  furthermore  we incurred additional royalty fees as a result of franchisor negotiations related to the ipo of approximately  during the twelve months ended december  these two costs equate to an additional increase in hotel operating expenses during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in the following table details our hotel operating expenses for our same store portfolio for the years ended december  and december  dollars in thousands year ended december  year ended december  same store portfolio expenses hotels rooms expense other direct expense other indirect expense other expense total hotel operating expenses depreciation and amortization

impairment losses 
during the year ended december   our predecessor determined that four parcels of undeveloped land were impaired due to the termination of sales contracts for the sale of the land parcels and management s resulting determination that their carrying amounts were no longer realizable 
as a result  our predecessor recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of our predecessor determined that the fair market value of these land parcels was million as of december  during the year ended december   our predecessor determined that six parcels of undeveloped land were impaired due to the fact that their aggregate historical carrying value exceeded their aggregate fair value 
this impairment was the result of our predecessor s decision to stop development projects and attempt to sell the land 
as a result  our predecessor recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of also in  our predecessor determined that the courtyard by marriott located in memphis  tennessee was impaired due to the fact that its historical carrying value was higher than the hotel s fair value 
this determination was made based on economic distress on this particular hotel and market 
accordingly  our predecessor recorded a million noncash impairment charge in cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased approximately million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the prior year period largely due to an increase in prepaid expenses related to ipo expenses 
the approximately million decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  compared to the prior year period was the result of no acquisitions of hotels in the twelve months ended december  the approximately million increase in net cash used in financing activities for the twelve months ended december  compared to the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in principal payments on debt and no offering proceeds received during compared to  despite a reduction in distributions to members in liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotel properties  including recurring maintenance and capital expenditures necessary to maintain our hotel properties in accordance with brand standards  capital expenditures to improve our hotel properties  acquisitions  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and distributions to our stockholders 
acquisitions on january   we purchased the unit courtyard by marriott hotel in atlanta  georgia for a purchase price of approximately million  or approximately  per key 
we expect to perform a minor renovation of approximately  for a combined purchase price and renovation cost of approximately  per key 
we funded the purchase price of this acquisition through the assumption of a term loan with empire financial with a principal balance of million  and funded the remainder of the purchase price with borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility 
in connection with this acquisition  we have engaged courtyard management to manage the hotel pursuant to a hotel management agreement 
we anticipate that we will acquire two hotels located in birmingham  alabama  described below  during the first quarter in we have entered into an agreement to purchase a room hilton garden inn hotel in birmingham  alabama 
the purchase price is million  and closing is expected to occur during the first quarter of we anticipate performing approximately million of renovations to the hotel for a combined purchase and renovation cost of approximately  per key 
we will fund the purchase price with a draw on our secured revolving credit facility 
the hotel will be managed by hp hotels 
we have entered into an agreement to purchase a room hilton garden inn hotel in birmingham  alabama 
the purchase price is million  and closing is expected to occur during the first quarter of we anticipate performing approximately  of renovations to the hotel for a combined purchase and renovation cost of approximately  per key 
we will fund the purchase price with a draw on our secured revolving credit facility 
the hotel will be managed by hp hotels 
acquisition of one or both of these hotels  or other hotels identified by us  may occur if all conditions to closing are satisfied  and if we have sufficient funds to complete such purchases  considering other short and long term liquidity requirements  including planned capital expenditures at our existing hotels 
if one or more hotels is purchased  we expect to fund any purchases with working capital  funds available under the senior secured revolving credit facility  assumption of existing mortgage debt or additional mortgage loans 
the conditions to closing may not be satisfied  and we may not have sufficient funds to make such purchases  and thus  we cannot assure you that we will acquire any properties 
short term liquidity requirements we expect to satisfy our short term liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures  scheduled debt payments and funding the cash portion of the purchase price of hotel properties under contract  if acquired  with working capital  cash provided by operations  and short term borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility 
in addition  we may fund the purchase price of hotel acquisitions and cost of required capital improvements by assuming existing mortgage debt  issuing securities including partnership units issued by summit op  or incurring other mortgage debt 
further  we may seek to raise capital through public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities 
however  certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered hotel properties  borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders and market conditions 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive  or at all 
we believe that our working capital  cash provided by operations  borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility  and other sources of funds available to us will be sufficient to meet our ongoing short term liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
since december   we have refinanced million of our existing debt that would otherwise have matured or been callable during  leaving approximately million of debt approximately of our total debt outstanding on december  that matures prior to december  it may be difficult to refinance such loans on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and we may not have sufficient borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility to repay the maturing debt using draws on that facility for amounts that we are unable to refinance 
although we believe that we will be able to refinance these loans or will have the capacity to repay them  if necessary  using draws under our revolving credit facility  there can be no assurance that our revolving credit facility will be available to repay such maturing debt  as draws under our credit facility are subject to certain financial covenants 
we anticipate making renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures with respect to our hotel properties  including approximately million in capital expenditures we have budgeted to be spent during  pursuant to property improvement plans required by our franchisors 
long term liquidity requirements our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of the costs of acquiring additional hotel properties  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically with respect to our hotel properties  and scheduled debt payments  including maturing loans 
we will seek to satisfy these long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including working capital  cash provided by operations  long term hotel mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings  including borrowings under our secured credit facility 
in addition  we may seek to raise capital through public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities 
however  certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our ability to access these capital sources  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered hotel properties  borrowing restrictions imposed by lenders and market conditions 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive  or at all 
to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain 
therefore  we will need to raise additional capital in order to grow our business and invest in additional hotel properties 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to borrow funds or raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we anticipate that debt we incur in the future may include  as does our current debt  restrictions including lockbox and cash management provisions that under certain circumstances may limit or prohibit summit op and its subsidiaries from making distributions or paying dividends  repaying loans or transferring assets 
outstanding indebtedness as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding indebtedness secured by mortgages on hotels and eight hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt  including four hotels containing guestrooms operating under brands owned by marriott  hilton  ihg and hyatt that are available to be used as collateral for potential future loans 
our revolving credit facility is available to fund future acquisitions  property redevelopments and working capital requirements including the repayment of debt 
as of december   the maximum amount of borrowing permitted by the terms of our revolving credit facility is approximately million 
of this maximum amount  approximately million is available for us to borrow as of february  we maintain a prudent capital structure and  while the ratio will vary from time to time  we generally intend to limit our ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to no more than six to one 
for purposes of calculating this ratio we exclude preferred stock from indebtedness 
during we financed our long term growth with common and preferred equity issuances and debt financing having staggered maturities  and intend to continue to do so in the future 
our debt includes  and may include in the future  mortgage debt secured by hotels and unsecured debt

we believe that we will have adequate liquidity to meet requirements for scheduled maturities 
however  we can provide no assurances that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due and  if refinanced  whether such refinancing will be available on favorable terms 
capital expenditures we have budgeted to spend approximately million during for capital improvements to be made to the hotels in our portfolio  including capital improvements that we may be required to make pursuant to property improvement plans with respect to certain hotels in our portfolio  including our recent acquisitions and in connection with the entry into new franchise agreements for the former choice hotels 
in addition  we may make additional capital improvements at hotels we acquire in the future 
since the completion of our ipo on february  through december   we funded approximately million of capital improvements at our hotels 
during  we have completed renovations at seven of our hotels not including renovations due to franchise conversions and currently have renovations underway at five of our hotels 
we expect to fund the future capital improvements with working capital  borrowings and other potential sources of capital to the extent available to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors

interest payments have been included based on the weighted average interest rate 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our predecessor s significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to its consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that will require our management to exercise their business judgment or make significant estimates principles of consolidation and basis of presentation 
our consolidated financial statements include our accounts  the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries or subsidiaries for which we have a controlling interest  the accounts of variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary  and the accounts of other subsidiaries over which we have a controlling interest 
all material inter company transactions  balances and profits will be eliminated in consolidation 
the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors which require management in some cases to estimate future cash flows or likely courses of action 
hotels acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price based on the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
we determine the acquisition date fair values of all assets and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers  for example  using a discounted cash flow analysis that utilizes appropriate discount and or capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
changes in estimates and judgments related to the allocation of the purchase price could result in adjustments to real estate or intangible assets  which can affect depreciation and or amortization expense and our results of operations 
depreciation and amortization of hotels 
hotels are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and two to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives and classification of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to the assets 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated useful lives could affect the results of operations 
impairment of hotels 
we monitor events and changes in circumstances for indicators that the carrying value of a hotel and related assets may be impaired 
factors that could trigger an impairment analysis include  among others significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of a hotel or the strategy of our overall business  a significant increase in competition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or regulations or significant negative industry or economic trends 
when such factors are identified  we prepare an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific hotel and determine if the investment in such hotel is recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  an adjustment is made to the carrying value of the hotel to reflect the hotel at fair value 
these assessments may affect the results of our operations 
stock based compensation 
we have adopted the equity incentive plan  which provides for the grants of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  dividend equivalent rights and other stock based awards  or any combination of the foregoing 
equity based compensation will be recognized as an expense in the financial statements over the vesting period and measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the amount of the expense may be subject to adjustment in future periods depending on the specific characteristics of the equity based award and the application of accounting guidance 
income taxes 
we intend to elect to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our short taxable year ended december  upon filing our federal income tax return for that year 
we have operated so as to qualify as a reit since our ipo 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute annually to our stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax other than taxes paid by our trss to the extent we currently distribute of our reit taxable income to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless we satisfy certain relief provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders 
however  we intend to be organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit 
deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we will account for federal and state income taxes with respect to our trss using the asset and liability method
