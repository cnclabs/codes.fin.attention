item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical product candidates for the treatment of obesity 
our lead combination product candidates targeted for obesity are contrave  which has completed phase iii clinical trials for which a new drug application  or nda  has been submitted and reviewed by the us food and drug administration  or fda  and empatic  which has completed phase ii clinical trials 
each of these product candidates is a combination of generic drugs  which we have systematically screened for synergistic central nervous system  or cns  activity 
each of the components of our product candidates has already received regulatory approval for other indications and has been commercialized previously 
we are developing these combinations in an effort to demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety for potential regulatory approval 
we have not yet received regulatory approval for either product candidate 
in january  we received a complete response letter  or crl  from the fda concerning our previously submitted nda for contrave 
a crl is issued by the fda when the review of an nda is completed and questions remain that precludes the approval of the nda in its current form 
the crl for contrave indicated that the fda could not approve the nda in its present form primarily due to concerns regarding the theoretical cardiovascular risk of contrave treatment when used long term in a population of overweight and obese subjects 
the crl stated that before our nda could be approved  we must conduct a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial of sufficient size and duration to demonstrate that the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in overweight and obese subjects treated with contrave does not adversely affect the drug s benefit risk profile 
we disputed the fda decisions in the crl with respect to contrave 
in september  we received written correspondence detailing the fda s office of new drugs  or ond  design requirements for a cardiovascular outcomes trial  or cvot  for contrave that would address the crl 
we believe that these design requirements are feasible and provide the certainty required to continue the development of contrave 
importantly  the fda stated that if the interim analysis meets the specified criteria to exclude an unacceptable increased cardiovascular risk  contrave could be approved prior to completion of the cvot 
in early february we reached agreement with the fda on the trial protocol through the special protocol assessment  or spa  for the cvot 
we expect to initiate the cvot late in the second quarter of in december  we completed a public offering of  units 
each unit consists of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase ten shares of common stock  at a price to the public of per share of common stock and per warrant to purchase each share of common stock  which together comprise the purchase price of per unit 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
the warrants issued in the transaction have an exercise price equal to per share 
each warrant is exercisable in whole or in part for a period of years commencing on december   subject to certain limitations set forth in the warrant 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net cash proceeds from the public offering were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 

table of contents our primary activities since incorporation have been organizational activities  including recruiting personnel  conducting research and development  including clinical trials  and raising capital 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  primarily costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current product candidates  and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur losses for the next several years 
successful transition to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure  and until that time  we may need to continue to raise additional equity or debt financing 
revenues we generated approximately million in revenue in  resulting from the sublicensing of technology and amounts earned under our collaboration agreements 
in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with takeda to develop and commercialize contrave in the united states  canada and mexico 
under the collaboration agreement  we received an upfront  nonrefundable cash payment of million from takeda and this amount is being recognized ratably over the estimated life of the agreement 
for and  we recognized revenue of million and million  respectively  related to the takeda agreement 
during  we sublicensed technology to cypress bioscience  inc  or cypress  for an upfront payment of million  and this amount was being recognized ratably over the estimated life of the sublicensed patent 
in january  cypress exercised its right to terminate the agreement 
the remaining deferred revenue of  was recognized in the first quarter ending march  other than the amortization of the upfront payment of million from takeda  we do not expect to generate any significant revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones or product sales unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval of  and commercialize  our product candidates 
research and development expenses the majority of our operating expenses to date have been incurred in research and development activities 
our research and development expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical trials managed by our contract research organizations  or cros  product development efforts and manufacturing costs 
license fees  salaries and related employee benefits for certain personnel  and costs associated with certain non clinical activities such as regulatory expenses  are also included in this amount 
our most significant costs to date are expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials for contrave and empatic 
the clinical trial expenses included payments to vendors such as cros  investigators  suppliers of clinical drug materials and related consultants 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred because the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future uses 
our internal research and development resources are not directly tied to any individual research project and are primarily deployed across our contrave and empatic programs  both of which target the obesity market 
we are developing our two obesity product candidates in parallel and  due to the fact that we use shared resources across projects  we do not maintain information regarding our internal costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
we use external service providers to manage our clinical trials  to manufacture the product supplies used in these trials and for formulations development  consulting and other activities 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the year ended december  costs that are not attributable to a specific research program are included in the other category in thousands costs of external service providers obesity other subtotal internal costs stock based compensation total research and development costs at this time  due to the risks inherent in the drug development process  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development  if any  of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
specifically  we cannot quantify the development expenses associated with completion of the cvot for contrave 
however  we anticipate that the costs to conduct the cvot to the interim analysis would be approximately million 
future development expenses will depend on the scope and timing of the cvot and any other additional clinical trials for contrave  if any  our financial resources  as well as decisions made with respect to our empatic program and ongoing assessments as to each product candidate s commercial potential 
clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations 
the lengthy process of completing our clinical trials  including the cvot  and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
any failure by us or delay in completing our clinical trials  including the cvot  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause a delay in the commencement of product revenues and cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not expect contrave to be commercially available in any major market until the end of at the earliest  if at all  and empatic to be commercially available in any major market for at least several years  if at all 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting and internal support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses to remain generally unchanged as we continue to pursue the development of contrave and empatic 
other income expense other income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
interest expense consists of interest incurred in connection with the million credit and security agreement  as amended  with ge healthcare financial services which was paid in full and terminated in july income taxes at december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and  respectively  unless previously utilized 
at december   we have federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively 
the federal research and development tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in unless previously utilized and 
table of contents the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely 
under section and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
although we have determined that more likely than not an ownership change has occurred in december  we have not completed an update of our section analysis subsequent to december  until this analysis has been updated  we have removed deferred tax assets for net operating losses of million and research and development credits of million from our deferred tax asset schedule and have recorded a corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance 
when this analysis is finalized  we will reassess the amount of net operating losses and credits subject to limitation under section due to the existence of the valuation allowance  future changes in the deferred tax assets related to these tax attributes will not impact our effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development expenses a substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities are or are expected be performed under agreements we enter into with external service providers  including cros  which conduct many of our research and development activities 
we accrue for costs incurred under these contracts based on factors such as estimates of work performed  patient enrollment  progress of patient studies and other events 
however  the level of estimates can be significant 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of clinical trial expenses 
we make good faith estimates that we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risks and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
revenue recognition we have entered into agreements with takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  and which contain multiple elements  including nonrefundable upfront fees  payments for reimbursement of research costs  payments associated with achieving specific development milestones and royalties based on specified percentages of net product sales  if any 
prior to the revised multiple element and milestone method of revenue recognition guidance adopted by us on january   nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under the agreements were recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but were deferred if we had continuing performance obligations 
if we had continuing involvement through contractual obligations under such agreements  such up front fees were deferred and recognized over the period for which we continued to have a performance obligation 
both the takeda and cypress agreements had continuing obligations  and as a result the up front fees were deferred upon receipt 
effective january   for multiple element agreements entered into or materially modified after december   we follow the provisions of asu no 
during  we did not enter into any new collaborations 
in order to account for the multiple element arrangements  we identify the deliverables included 
table of contents within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting 
analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment  and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver services  a right or license to use an asset  or another performance obligation 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the partner on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
factors considered in this determination include the research capabilities of the partner and the availability of research expertise in this field in the general marketplace 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement 
upfront license fee payments are recognized upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances dictate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered items  which generally include research and development services and the manufacture of drug products  the relative selling price allocation of the license is equal to or exceeds the upfront license fee  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the partner is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
upfront license fee payments are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have standalone value 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have a material impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
the terms of our partnership agreements provide for milestone payments upon achievement of certain regulatory development and sales based events 
effective january   we adopted on a prospective basis the guidance under asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method 
under the milestone method of accounting  we recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is substantive in its entirety 
a milestone is considered substantive when it meets all of the following three criteria the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to us 
the adoption of this new accounting standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
royalties to be received based on sales of our licensed products by partners will be recognized as earned 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees 
share based payment transactions with employees are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period 

table of contents we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees  directors and non employees under our equity incentive award plan 
stock based compensation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
at december   total unrecognized estimated stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we calculate the fair value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  risk free interest rate and the expected term of the awards 
the weighted average expected life of options was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed by the securities exchange commission 
this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited historical experience 
for options granted during the year ended december   we have calculated a weighted average expected term of years 
in addition  due to our limited historical data  the estimated volatility incorporates the historical volatility of comparable companies whose share prices are publicly available 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during using the black scholes model  we used estimated weighted average stock price volatility of 
the risk free interest rate assumption was based on the united states treasury s rates for us treasury zero coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued weighted average risk free interest rate of for the year ended december  
the assumed dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
for  and  we have reduced stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations to reflect estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for all years ended december   and based on historical experience 
equity instruments issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value and are periodically revalued as the equity instruments vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
income taxes we follow the provisions of the income taxes topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  that defines a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax provision taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the topic also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under the topic  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the differences reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets unless  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 

table of contents results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase of approximately million was due to the revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement with takeda of million and the increase in revenue recognized under the license agreement with cypress of research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately million was due primarily to a decrease in costs incurred in connection with the preparation for our nda filing and fda advisory committee meeting for contrave of million  a decrease in salaries and personnel related costs totaling approximately million  a decrease in license fees of million  a decrease in expenses in connection with our contrave phase iii clinical trials  related proprietary product formulation work and consulting activities totaling million and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately million was due primarily to a decrease in salaries and personnel related costs of approximately million  a decrease in market research costs totaling million  a decrease in medical affairs expense of  and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of approximately  interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in this decrease of approximately  was primarily due to lower interest rates and a decrease in investment balances as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in this decrease of  was due to the debt under the credit and security agreement with ge healthcare financial services being paid in full in july comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the years ended december  and were million and  respectively 
the increase of million was due to revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement with takeda 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately million was due primarily to a decrease in expenses in connection with our contrave phase iii clinical trials  related proprietary product formulation work and consulting activities totaling million 
the decrease in research and development expenses was partly offset by an increase in salaries and personnel related costs totaling approximately million and an increase in costs incurred in connection with the preparation for our nda filing and fda advisory committee meeting for contrave of million 
in addition  research and development expenses for were offset by approximately  of certain commercial costs to be reimbursed by takeda as permitted under the collaboration agreement and also by  awarded to us by the department of treasury under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project grant program 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase of approximately million was due primarily to an increase in salaries and personnel related costs of approximately million  an increase in stock based compensation expense of approximately million and an increase in legal fees of  
table of contents interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  in this decrease of approximately  was primarily due to lower interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  for the year ended december  from million in this decrease of approximately  was primarily due to the decrease in interest expense resulting from a lower average interest rate and a lower average outstanding balance on the amounts borrowed under the credit and security agreement with ge healthcare financial services 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows from september  to december   we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of in march  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series a redeemable convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million and the conversion of promissory notes and interest thereon totaling million  from april to may  we issued and sold  shares of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in november  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in may  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in january and february  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  and in july  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  and in december  we issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock and common stock warrants to purchase up to  shares for aggregate net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and an additional million in investment securities  available for sale 
as of december   our holdings primarily consisted of treasury backed money market funds  treasuries and other instruments that are insured  guaranteed or supported by the us federal government and some high quality corporate debt obligations 
we maintain established guidelines relating to diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities was million for and net cash provided by operating activities was million for in  we received an upfront payment of million from takeda 
net cash used in each of these periods was primarily a result of external research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  personnel related costs  third party supplier expenses and professional fees 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for and the net cash used in investing activities was million for these amounts are primarily the result of the net purchases and maturities of investment securities 

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities for was million and net cash used in financing activities for was million 
the net cash provided by financing activities for is primarily as a result of the public sale of our common stock and warrants in december for aggregate net proceeds of million 
we cannot be certain if  when or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we will incur substantial additional development expenses to conduct the cvot 
the cvot is designed to enroll approximately  patients  and we would expect to complete the interim analysis within two years following the trial s commencement 
we expect to initiate the cvot late in the second quarter of we anticipate that it will cost approximately million to conduct this trial to the interim analysis 
we have entered into license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize contrave and empatic 
pursuant to these agreements  we obtained exclusive and non exclusive licenses to the patent rights and know how for selected indications and territories 
under our license agreement with duke university  we issued  shares of our common stock in march and may be required to make future milestone payments totaling up to million upon the achievement of various milestones related to regulatory or commercial events 
under our license agreement with lee dante  md  we issued an option to purchase  shares of our common stock in april we also paid dr 
dante an upfront fee of  and  in september  we paid him an additional million upon the execution of the collaboration agreement with takeda 
in the future  we may be obligated to pay royalties to dr 
dante related to certain revenues we receive in connection with any sublicense agreements we enter into  including our collaboration agreement with takeda 
under our license agreement with oregon health science university  we issued  shares of our common stock in december and paid an upfront fee of  under these three agreements  we are also obligated to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the scope  cost and timing of the cvot and any other additional clinical trials required for contrave and empatic  including expenses to support the trials and milestone payments that may become payable  and the decisions we make with respect to the continued development of such product candidates  the extent to which we in license  acquire or invest in other indications  products  technologies and businesses  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing  co promotion or other arrangements that we may establish with respect to contrave or empatic or any other product candidates that we may in license or acquire  the costs of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities in order to commercialize contrave if and when it is approved for marketing or any other product candidates that we may in license or acquire  should we elect to do so  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals for contrave and empatic  if at all  and the successful commercialization of our products 
although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through the next months 

table of contents until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources  proceeds of potential offerings of our equity securities  debt  receivables or royalty financings and potential corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements 
however  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and or our pre commercialization and commercialization activities  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
debt  receivables and royalty financings may be coupled with an equity component  such as warrants to purchase stock  which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders ownership 
if we raise additional funds through debt  receivables or royalty financings  the terms of such financings may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial requirements that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if these market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table describes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by periods total less than year years years after operating lease obligations total we have not included certain license obligations which may require additional payments of up to million due upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to regulatory or commercial events 
we may also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products 
license payments may increase based on the timing of various milestones and the extent to which the licensed technologies are pursued for other indications 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
this newly issued accounting standard requires an entity to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position as well as instruments and transactions executed under a master netting or similar arrangement and was issued to enable users of financial statements to understand the effects or potential effects of those arrangements on its financial position 

table of contents asu is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after january  as this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic asu no 

asu no 
amends the presentation of comprehensive income to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  or the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
asu no 
is effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting standards related to the accounting for revenue in arrangements with multiple deliverables including how the arrangement consideration is allocated among delivered and undelivered items of the arrangement 
among the amendments  this standard eliminates the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement consideration and requires an entity to allocate the overall consideration to each deliverable based on an estimated selling price of each individual deliverable in the arrangement in the absence of having vendor specific objective evidence or other third party evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
this standard also provides further guidance on how to determine a separate unit of accounting in a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement and expands the disclosure requirements about the judgments made in applying the estimated selling price method and how those judgments affect the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
if and when we enter into a new collaboration or materially modifies an existing collaboration  we will be required to apply the new multiple deliverable guidance 
we adopted this guidance as of january  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method asu no 

asu no 
establishes a revenue recognition method for contingent consideration that is payable upon the achievement of an uncertain future event  referred to as a milestone 
the scope of the milestone method is limited to research and development agreements and is applicable to milestones in multiple deliverable arrangements involving research and development transactions 
milestones  under applicable guidance are defined as events that can only be achieved in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting in the entity s performance for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and that would result in additional payments being due to us 
we evaluate events under this guidance at the inception of an arrangement to determine the existence of milestones and if they are substantive 
the guidance does not preclude the application of any other applicable revenue guidance 
we adopted this guidance as of january  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale  as of december  consisted primarily of money market funds  us government agency securities and corporate debt obligations 
we do not have any auction rate securities on our balance sheet  as they are not permitted by our investment policy 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the 
table of contents general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
our cash is invested in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors which specifies the categories  allocations  and ratings of securities we may consider for investment 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
we made this determination based on discussions with our investment advisors and a review of our holdings 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities are well diversified and do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  domestic and international equity markets have experienced and may continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil based on domestic and international economic conditions and concerns 
in the event these economic conditions and concerns continue and the markets continue to remain volatile  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary and our stock price may further decline 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents that are not federally insured 
if economic instability continues  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these investments
