business overview trends and economic environment in june  we determined to exit our global retail business and focus solely on growing our oem business 
our decision to eliminate our retail division was based primarily on the longer than estimated path to bring it to profitability and the strong top line growth and cost rationalizations achieved in the oem business over the past two years 
in connection with the exit of our retail business  we entered into a second memorandum of understanding the new mou with g form 
in accordance with this new mou we have assisted g form on a short term basis with transitioning certain operational and sales functions previously performed by forward for g form products 
we continue to work with g form to distribute our remaining retail product inventory and are working with them to settle on the amount of funds owed to us as a result of the net effect of certain transactions between g form and us  as contemplated under the new mou 
as part of our ongoing restructuring  we implemented several key measures beginning in mid fiscal to improve our operating performance and return our company to profitability 
these actions included replacing our legacy sourcing and quality assurance infrastructure with a variable  lower cost  solution through our use of an exclusive  asia based  sourcing agent refer to note in our notes to financial statements 
we believe that this agency relationship will yield meaningful  longer term benefits  in terms of negotiating favorable material costs  improving the quality of our products  and diversifying our supplier base 
with regard to lowering our fixed overhead  we have closed our offices in london  dubai saarbrucken  and santa monica  and relocated our corporate headquarters to west palm beach  where we expect costs of operation to be lower 
in addition  we have significantly reduced headcount through elimination of personnel dedicated to our retail business and reinvested a portion of these costs savings to expand and restructure our sales  design  customer service  finance and it personnel focused on growing our oem business 
lastly  we have begun to implement a rigorous cost rationalization plan with regard to other components of our operating expenses that we believe will result in a more streamlined and efficient use of our working capital 
with regard to our oem business  it remains highly concentrated by customer and product type  especially with respect to our diabetic products line  where we continue to operate in a very challenging price sensitive environment 
we continue to experience pricing pressure from our major diabetic products customers  but especially with respect to certain of our longer lived programs for which price concessions are expected to be granted to them over an extended period of time 
moreover  we are encountering higher costs from our china based suppliers due to materials and labor price increases that place continuing pressure on our profit margins 
in certain cases  we are not able to pass these higher costs through to customers  particularly when replacement program products resemble their predecessors or historically similar products  for which customers have become accustomed to a narrow price range 
through our exclusive sourcing agent in the apac region  we have intensified our search for alternative sources of supply to expand and diversify our manufacturing capabilities in order to mitigate this trend 
in late fiscal  we were awarded several large programs by diabetic products customers c and d that have contributed meaningfully to our net sales and overall product mix in fiscal as we expected  these new programs increased our sales volume  but depressed our overall gross margin in the fiscal  as the gross margins on these programs are lower than those seen in fiscal we expect that these new programs will continue to represent a significant portion of our overall product mix during fiscal and anticipate that our overall gross margin for will continue to reflect this 
our gross margin in fiscal was also negatively impacted by a significant level of quality remediation charges  as well as transition and termination costs in respect of the restructure of our sourcing and quality operations 
we believe these to be non recurring 
variability of revenues and results of operation because a high percentage of our sales revenues is highly concentrated in a few large customers  and because the volumes of these customers order flows to us are highly variable  with short lead times  our quarterly revenues  and consequently our results of operations  are susceptible to significant variability over a relatively short period of time 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the discussion below is not intended to be comprehensive 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment of a particular transaction 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion of the applications of these and other accounting policies  refer to
