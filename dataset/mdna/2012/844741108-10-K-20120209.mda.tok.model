table of contents note regarding use of non gaap financial measures the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these gaap financial statements include i unrealized non cash adjustments and reclassifications  which can be significant  as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and ii other charges the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operational performance 
as a result  the company also provides financial information in this filing that was not prepared in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company provides supplemental non gaap financial information  including results that it refers to as economic  which the company s management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the company believes provides greater transparency to investors as supplemental information to its gaap results 
the company s economic financial results differ from gaap results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts all reflected within fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement 
thus  fuel and oil expense on an economic basis reflects the company s actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period  inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts 
any net premium costs paid related to option contracts are reflected as a component of other gains losses  net  for both gaap and non gaap including economic purposes in the period of contract settlement 
these economic results provide a better measure of the impact of the company s fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized  non cash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in gaap results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments  and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within fuel and oil expense 
this enables the company s management  as well as investors  to consistently assess the company s operating performance on a year over year or quarter over quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense 
however  because these measures are not determined in accordance with gaap  such measures are susceptible to varying calculations and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner 
as a result  the aforementioned measures  as presented  may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
further information on i the company s fuel hedging program  ii the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments  and iii the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and or mark to market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to its economic financial measures  as defined above  the company has also provided other non gaap financial measures as a result of items that the company believes are not indicative of its ongoing operations 
these include and charges of million and million  respectively  before the impact of profitsharing and or taxes related to expenses associated with the company s acquisition and integration of airtran  a charge of million before the impact of profitsharing and or taxes for an asset impairment related to the company s decision not to equip its classic aircraft with required navigation performance rnp capabilities  and a charge of million before profitsharing and or taxes related to freedom  a voluntary early retirement program 
the company believes that evaluation of its financial performance compared to prior and future periods can be enhanced by a presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items 
as a result of the company s acquisition of airtran  which closed on may   the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur substantial charges associated with integration of the two companies 
while the company cannot predict the exact timing or amounts of such charges  it does expect to treat the charges as special items in its future presentation of non gaap results 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the airtran acquisition and freedom  respectively 
year in review for the th consecutive year  the company was profitable  earning million 
per share  diluted in  compared to the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted 
on a non gaap 
table of contents basis  the company s net income was million 
per share  diluted  which was below the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted  on a non gaap basis 
operating income for was million  which was a percent decrease versus on a non gaap basis  the company s operating income was million  or percent lower than see the previous note regarding the use of non gaap financial measures 
the decline in both net income and operating income  on both a gaap and a non gaap basis  primarily was attributable to higher fuel costs 
in fact  a percent increase in the company s economic jet fuel cost per gallon compared to drove the majority of an over billion year over year increase in economic fuel and oil expense 
however  the company was able to combat the persistently high fuel costs by generating a percent increase in operating revenues  thus enabling the company to remain profitable 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for gaap reporting  the accompanying results of operations and cash flows contain airtran s results beginning as of the date of the acquisition  while the prior year includes only the results of southwest for all periods presented 
in certain discussions that follow  primarily those involving forward looking information used in the projection of future results  the company has chosen to make comparisons to prior year combined results or measures in order to provide more meaningful information since all future results for southwest will include airtran results 
prior year combined results consist of the combination of southwest and airtran stand alone results  without any retrospective application of acquisition related accounting adjustments 
the company focused a significant amount of its efforts during on various revenue improvement initiatives 
the company s major strategic initiatives include the acquisition and integration of airtran in order to grow the company s network  gain access to key markets  and gain synergies through optimization of the combined carriers operations  implementation of southwest s all new rapid rewards frequent flyer program  which took place in first quarter and which has exceeded the company s expectations with respect to the number of frequent flyer members added  the amount spent per member on airfare  the number of flights taken by members  the number of southwest s co branded chase visa credit card holders added  and the number of frequent flyer points purchased by program members  the addition of a larger aircraft  the boeing  to southwest s fleet  which is scheduled to begin in first quarter and is expected to allow the company to profitably expand to new destinations  including near international locations  generate additional revenue by replacing current aircraft on specified routes and locations that are restricted due to space constraints or slot controls  and operate at a lower seat mile cost  acceleration of the company s fleet modernization efforts 
the company announced in december  that it will be the first airline to accept delivery of boeing s new  more fuel efficient max  which is expected to enter service in in connection with its fleet modernization program  the company placed orders for a total of boeing max aircraft and added a total of boeing ng aircraft to its existing firm order book 
the max is expected to reduce co emissions and improve fuel burn by an additional to percent over today s most fuel efficient  single aisle airplane 
in january  the company also announced plans to retrofit its fleet with an updated cabin interior 
evolve the new southwest experience is intended to enhance customer comfort  personal space  and the overall travel experience  while improving fleet efficiency and being environmentally responsible 
by maximizing the space inside the plane  evolve allows for the added benefit of six additional seats on each aircraft  along with more climate friendly and cost effective materials 
these retrofits for southwest aircraft are expected to begin in march and to be completed in the company plans to retrofit the airtran current fleet of s as such aircraft are converted to the southwest livery beginning in evaluation of short term and long term options to eventually replace southwest s reservation system  which is currently limited to domestic service 
this will allow the company to add international destinations  as well as other important customer service automations and functionality 

table of contents each of these initiatives is expected to contribute significant incremental revenues once fully implemented 
the company currently believes the acquisition of airtran has the potential to yield net annual synergies of more than million in  not including acquisition and integration costs 
the company incurred million in acquisition and integration expenses in excluding acquisition and integration expenses estimated to total approximately million through  the transaction was modestly accretive to the company s earnings in  excluding special items  is expected to be accretive in  and is expected to be strongly accretive thereafter  upon full realization of the estimated net synergies 
in addition  although southwest and airtran currently continue to operate as two separate airlines  the two carriers remain complementary with little route overlap 
strategically  both carriers have placed an emphasis on outstanding customer service  high quality low cost operations  solid low fare brands  and strong employee cultures 
the company continues to make progress with the integration of airtran into its operations and existing processes 
the company has moved the vast majority of airtran s headquarters functions from orlando to dallas and expects to have approval from the faa to achieve a single operating certificate in the first quarter of the company has begun converting space in airports where both carriers operate and plans to begin converting airtran s fleet to the southwest livery beginning in the first quarter of the company has begun optimizing airtran s network  and is also planning to launch booking tools in to allow customers of both airlines to book flights on either carrier via southwest 
com or airtran 
com and to integrate the frequent flyer programs of the carriers 
also  in fourth quarter  the company announced that the southwest airlines pilots association swapa  the union representing southwest pilots  the air line pilots association alpa  the union representing the pilots of airtran  and the company reached an agreement to integrate the two pilot groups seniority lists 
the agreement was approved by swapa s board of directors and alpa s master executive council and was ratified by the membership of each union 
in december  the transportation workers of america  afl cio  local twu  the union that represents southwest flight attendants  the association of flight attendants afa  the union that represents airtran flight attendants  and the company reached an agreement to integrate the two flight attendant groups seniority lists 
twu s executive board and afa s master executive council both approved the agreement 
the agreement was ratified by the respective memberships in january the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa  the union representing southwest aircraft mechanics  the international brotherhood of teamsters  local ibt  the union representing the airtran mechanics  and the company reached a tentative agreement subject to a ratification vote by the unions respective memberships 
the agreement would integrate the two groups seniority lists and also create a single labor agreement 
the membership of each union is currently considering the tentative agreement 
the transportation workers of america  afl cio local twu  the union representing southwest flight instructors  an employee committee representing the flight instructors of airtran  and the company reached an agreement to integrate the two groups seniority lists 
twu s executive committee and the employee committee representing the airtran flight instructors voted to pass the agreement forward to their respective members 
the agreement was ratified by the respective memberships in january aside from the new destinations provided by the acquisition of airtran  southwest began service to three new markets during charleston  south carolina  greenville spartanburg  south carolina  and the new york new jersey area through newark s liberty international airport 
the company has also announced southwest will begin service to atlanta  georgia during first quarter atlanta is currently airtran s largest hub  and the company will enhance airtran s existing service utilizing southwest aircraft and connecting this important destination to southwest s vast domestic network 
the efforts underway to fully integrate airtran s network and schedule with southwest s are expected to be a multi year undertaking  but one that the company believes will yield significant financial benefits 
at the current time  the company plans to continue its route network and schedule optimization efforts  but does not intend to grow its overall fleet size for the company currently expects to receive 
table of contents aircraft deliveries during  of which will be new aircraft from boeing  and five of which will be new s that are being leased from a third party 
the company also expects to retire approximately of its older s and s and expects asms to approximate the combined amount flown during by southwest and airtran 
results of operations compared with the company s consolidated net income of million 
per share  diluted in decreased by million  or percent  compared to its net income of million 
per share  diluted 
the results in each year were significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the company s hedging activities 
as a result of the fuel hedges the company had in place during including those that settled during and those that will settle in future years the company recognized a net total of million in losses allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
during  the company recognized a net total of million in losses as a result of its fuel hedging activities  allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net 
each of these totals for and includes the net premium costs the company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which are classified as a component of other gains losses  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments 
the company s results for also included a charge for asset impairment of million before the impact of profitsharing or taxes related to the company s decision not to equip its classic aircraft with rnp capabilities and airtran acquisition and integration related expenses of million before the impact of profitsharing or taxes 
the company s operating income of million was lower than the company s operating income of million  as the percent increase in operating expenses outpaced the percent increase in operating revenues

excluding the results of airtran following the acquisition  operating revenues for increased by billion  or percent  compared to  primarily due to a billion  or percent  increase in passenger revenues 
holding other factors constant  over percent of the increase in passenger revenues was attributable to the percent increase in southwest s capacity  versus the remainder of the increase primarily was due to higher passenger yields passenger revenues per rpm flown  as the company implemented fare increases in an attempt to buffer a portion of the impact of higher fuel costs 
the company s load factor also increased points to percent in  which was a record for the company 
these strong revenue results were achieved due to better revenue management techniques and 
table of contents strategies  continued optimization of the company s flight schedule to better match demand in certain markets  improving economic conditions  which led to higher demand for air travel versus  and at times  targeted marketing campaigns in which the company differentiated its product and service from competitors 
for january  the company experienced a year over year increase in passenger unit revenues of approximately seven percent compared to passenger unit revenues on a combined basis in january bookings and revenue trends  thus far  for the remainder of first quarter also remain strong 
consolidated freight revenues increased by million  or percent  versus  primarily due to higher average rates charged as a result of fuel surcharges and better economic conditions than the prior year 
the company currently expects freight revenues for first quarter to be in line with fourth quarter freight revenues 
excluding the results of airtran following the acquisition  other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to this increase was due to revenues from initiatives  such as the company s earlybird product  for which customers can pay to automatically receive an assigned boarding position before general checkin begins  and service charges for unaccompanied minors and pets 
the increase in revenues from initiatives was partially offset by a year over year increase in the portion of the commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners that were classified as passenger revenue 
the classification of such amounts is influenced by average fares  among other factors 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s frequent flyer program 
other revenues for airtran for the period following the acquisition included approximately million in baggage fees collected from customers 
the company expects consolidated other revenues for first quarter to fall below combined results for first quarter  due to a higher portion of expected revenues from business partners being classified as passenger revenues 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased by billion  or percent  compared to  while capacity increased percent compared to the increase in consolidated operating expenses was primarily due to the inclusion of airtran s operating expenses following the acquisition

see the previous note regarding use of non gaap financial measures 
excluding the results of airtran following the acquisition  salaries  wages  and benefits expense increased by million for compared to the majority of the year over year increase was due to the increase in southwest s capacity and number of trips flown  which was partially offset by a decrease in profitsharing expense resulting from lower income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the company records for its fuel hedging program as well as acquisition and integration costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel hedging 
consolidated salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm for decreased percent compared to on a per asm basis  the majority of this decrease was due to airtran unit costs for salaries  wages  and benefits being significantly lower than southwest s

table of contents all boeing fleet 
in october  the company amended its engine maintenance contracts with ge engine services 
previously  the engines on both its classic fleet s and its s were subject to power by the hour agreements under which the cost was based on the number of engine hours flown 
the amended agreement for the classic fleet no longer meets the risk transfer criteria of a power by the hour agreement  and thus expense will prospectively be recorded on a time and materials basis when an engine repair event takes place 
the maintenance contract for the engines on the company s fleet was amended primarily to incorporate the boeing s from the airtran acquisition and to extend the term of that agreement until december  the amendments to both maintenance contracts were effective october  the company currently expects consolidated maintenance materials and repairs expense per asm for first quarter to be comparable to combined first quarter results  based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events  scheduled engine shop visits  evolve retrofits  and projected engine hours flown

excluding the results of airtran following the acquisition  depreciation and amortization expense for increased million  or percent  on a dollar basis compared to approximately percent of this increase was due to the amortization associated with the intangible assets recognized upon the acquisition of airtran  such as customer relationships  trademarks  slots  domain name  and non compete agreements  and approximately percent was due to large projects that have been placed into service  such as the company s implementation of its all new rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
on a per asm basis  consolidated depreciation and amortization expense decreased by percent compared to  primarily due to the majority of airtran s fleet being on operating leases

excluding the impact of the freedom charge  approximately percent of the year over year increase was from higher salaries and wages  primarily as a result of higher average wage rates 
the remainder of the year over year increase primarily was attributable to a million increase in profitsharing  as a result of higher income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense is based on profits that exclude the unrealized gains and or losses the company records for its fuel hedging program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel hedging 
salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm was percent higher than  primarily due to pay scale increases as a result of increased seniority and contractual rate increases for the company s unionized workforce  who make up the majority of its employees  while the company s asm capacity increased only slightly compared to these increases combined with relatively flat headcount resulted in higher average rates per employee 
fuel and oil expense increased million  or percent  and on a per asm basis increased percent versus both the dollar and the per asm increase were driven primarily by an percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel  including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging  and including related taxes

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
maintenance materials and repairs increased percent on a dollar basis  and increased percent on a per asm basis compared to on both a dollar and a per asm basis  the increases were due to an increase in the number of scheduled airframe maintenance events versus aircraft rentals expense per asm decreased percent and  on a dollar basis  decreased million 
both decreases primarily were due to the renegotiation of several aircraft leases at lower rates 
landing fees and other rentals increased million on a dollar basis and increased percent on a per asm basis  compared to the majority of both the dollar increase and per asm increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of higher rates charged by those airports due to either higher operating costs or to cover shortfalls caused by reductions in service by airlines over the past few years 
when airlines reduce their capacity  airport costs are then allocated amongst a fewer number of total flights 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million on a dollar basis compared to  and was up percent on a per asm basis 
these increases were both primarily due to the amortization of capitalized software costs associated with various information technology upgrade and replacement projects the company completed during other operating expenses increased million  and were up percent on a per asm basis  compared to on both a dollar and a per asm basis  these increases primarily were due to an increase in revenue related costs such as credit card interchange fees associated with the percent increase in passenger revenues 

table of contents other interest expense decreased by million  or percent  primarily due to the company s conversion of its million of secured notes due and its million of senior unsecured notes due to floating interest rates during fourth quarter capitalized interest declined percent  or million  compared to  due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates

income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased to percent in from percent in the lower rate primarily was due to the company s higher earnings  which diluted the impact of permanent tax differences  thus reducing the tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion provided by operating activities in operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation to customers 
the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and  in some cases  several months before the anticipated travel date 
operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of airline operations 
operating cash flows can also be significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions

during  the city of dallas approved the love field modernization program lfmp  a project to reconstruct dallas love field airport with modern  convenient air travel facilities 
pursuant to a program development agreement pda with the city of dallas and the love field airport modernization corporation or lfamc  a texas non profit local government corporation established by the city to act on the city s behalf to facilitate the development of the lfmp  the company is managing this project 
major construction commenced during  with completion of the project scheduled for the second half of although subject to change  the project is expected to include the renovation of the airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new gate facility  including infrastructure  systems and equipment  aircraft parking apron  fueling system  roadways and terminal curbside  baggage handling systems  passenger loading bridges and support systems  and other supporting infrastructure 
during fourth quarter  the lfamc issued million in tax exempt facility revenue bonds lfmp bonds  the proceeds of which have been or will be used to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the lfmp  and to reimburse the company for approximately million in early lfmp expenditures made such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a june  inducement resolution approved by the dallas city council and subsequent resolutions by the lfamc 
repayment of the lfmp bonds will be through the facilities payments described below 
reimbursement of the company for its payment of facilities payments are expected to be made through recurring ground rents  fees  and other revenues collected at the airport 
the company has guaranteed principal  premium  and interest on the issued bonds 
depending on funding needs and the timing of these funds from other sources  an additional tranche of bonds is expected to be issued during it is currently expected that the total amount spent on the lfmp project will be approximately million 
prior to the issuance of the lfmp bonds by the lfamc  the company entered into two separate funding agreements a facilities agreement pursuant to which the company is obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the lfmp bonds facilities payments  less other sources of funds the city of dallas may apply to the repayment of the lfmp bonds including but not limited to passenger facility charges collected from passengers originating from the airport  and a revenue credit agreement pursuant to which the city of dallas will reimburse the company for the facilities payments made by the company 
a majority of the monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the use and lease agreement between the city of dallas and the company 
the use and lease agreement is a year agreement providing for  among other things  the company s lease of space at the airport from the city of dallas 
the remainder of such monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement is expected to originate from use and lease agreements with other airlines  various concession agreements  and other airport miscellaneous revenues 
the company s liquidity could be impacted by the lfmp to the extent there is not an additional future successful bond issuance or there is a timing difference between the company s payment of the facilities payments pursuant to the facilities agreement and the transfer of monies back to the company pursuant to the revenue credit agreement  however  the company does not currently anticipate the occurrence of either of these items 
the lfmp is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s capital resources or financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information and accounting requirements related to the lfmp 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
for air travel on southwest  the amount of tickets that will expire unused are estimated and recognized in passenger revenue once the scheduled flight date has passed 
estimating the amount of tickets that will expire unused  be refunded  or exchanged involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of southwest s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of unused tickets 
according to southwest s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
this policy also applies to unused customer funds that may be left over from exchanging a less expensive ticket for a previously purchased ticket that was more expensive 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
estimates of tickets that will expire unused are based on historical experience over many years 
southwest and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of scheduled travel 
holding other factors constant  a percent change in the company s including airtran s estimate of the amount of tickets that will expire unused would have resulted in a million  or percent  change in passenger revenues recognized for events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  changes to the company s ticketing policies  the company s refund  exchange  and unused funds policies  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  promotional fare activity  and the impact of the economic environment on customer behavior 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
during  as a result of the company s efforts to stimulate demand through fare sales  passenger revenues consisted of a higher percentage of discount tickets flown and a lower percentage of fully refundable tickets flown 
in addition  during  the company revised its unused funds policy to restrict the ability of a customer to transfer funds to another customer  which has resulted in an increase in expiration of unused funds 
consequently  the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets recorded during and during was approximately to percent higher than what it believes its historical averages would indicate for those years 
the company believes these estimates are supported by actual data and are reasonable given the underlying fact patterns 

table of contents the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets flight equipment and related assets make up the majority of the company s long lived assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft and boeing aircraft in the company s including airtran s fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease 
the remaining boeing aircraft and boeing aircraft in the company s including airtran s fleet at december   are operated under operating leases 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and their future expected cash flows 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values for new assets generally purchased from the manufacturer estimated useful life estimated residual value airframes and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types  current and projected future market information  and recommendations from boeing 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing as well as the aircraft age 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to aircraft maintenance programs  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense 
for example  during fourth quarter  the company changed the estimated residual values of its entire remaining fleet of owned and aircraft 
based on current and expected future market conditions related to these aircraft  the company reduced the residual values of these aircraft from approximately percent of original cost to approximately percent of original cost 
this determination was made due to the lack of buyers for these older aircraft  as many buyers of used aircraft prefer newer  more fuel efficient models  and the increase in the number of airlines retiring these older aircraft  which has increased the supply of older aircraft on the market 
as this reduction in residual value is considered a change in estimate  it was accounted for on a prospective basis  and thus the company has effectively accelerated the recording of depreciation expense over the remainder of the useful lives for each aircraft 
the impact of this change was not material 
the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
the company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce operating profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 

table of contents financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities  and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s fuel hedging program and financial derivative instruments 
all derivatives are required to be reflected at fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over separate financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for the years through changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices  as has been evident in recent years 
for example  during  market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of approximately per barrel and hit a low price of approximately per barrel 
during  market spot prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  value of the us dollar  geopolitical events  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  call spreads  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices 
forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the company s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the company hedges 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in some historical periods  because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company has in fact lost hedge accounting for a certain type of commodity  such as all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments 
there have also been instances in which the company has lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for certain types of commodities used in hedging 
at such times  the company has marked all such derivatives to fair value in each quarterly period  with all changes in value reflected as a component of other gains losses  net in the consolidated statement of income 
the company did not lose hedge accounting for an entire commodity during   or although the company s prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that the commodities used in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges  there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future 
this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes 
increased volatility in these commodity markets for an extended period of time  especially if such volatility were to worsen  could cause the company to lose hedge accounting altogether for the commodities used in its fuel hedging program  which would create further volatility in the company s financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their fair values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment 
to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness 
table of contents of the fuel hedge can result 
this could result in the immediate recording of non cash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire settle until a future period 
likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses  net in the consolidated statement of income in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the past volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity 
this may result  and has historically resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in fair value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during historical periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for mitigation of fuel price volatility 
the discontinuation of hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  can also be a result of these factors 
depending on the level at which the company is hedged at any point in time  as the fair value of the company s hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period  there could be continued variability recorded in the consolidated statement of income  and furthermore  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material 
this is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large volumes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting expected future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges 
the current methodology used by the company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices  depending on specific geographic locations in which the company hedges 
the company then adjusts for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors  in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge 
this methodology for estimating expected future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices has been consistently applied during   and  and has not changed for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
fair value measurements the company utilizes unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
at december   these included auction rate security investments  valued at million  a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts  which were a net asset of million  and million in other investments 
all of the company s auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level however  due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter  the auctions for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  the company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a 
table of contents discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model  which qualify the instruments as level the company s analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to par value 
in association with this estimate of fair value  the company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of million  with an offsetting entry to aoci 
given the quality and backing of the company s auction rate securities held  the fact that the company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments  and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments back to the issuer  it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary 
these conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods 
the company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
in addition  these auction rate securities represented less than two percent of the company s total cash  cash equivalents  and investment balance at december   which the company believes allows it sufficient time for the auction rate securities to return to full value 
at the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter  the company held a total of million in auction rate securities 
since that time  the company has been able to redeem million of these instruments at par value 
the company determines the fair value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets  can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets  or are quoted by its counterparties 
in situations where the company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties  it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared 
the company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable primarily volatility  the company has categorized these option contracts as level as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective  as defined  are offset within aoci until the period in which the expected future cash flow impacts earnings 
any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective  as defined  or that do not qualify for hedge accounting  are reflected in earnings within other gains losses  net  in the period of the change 
because the company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds  and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash  the company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the company s derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements  which provide for parties or the company to provide cash collateral when the fair value of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels 
since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding fuel derivative contracts  this provides further validation to the company s estimate of fair values 
frequent flyer accounting southwest and airtran utilize estimates in the recognition of liabilities associated with their respective frequent flyer programs 
these estimates primarily include the liability associated with frequent flyer member account balances that are expected to be redeemed for travel or other products at a future date  and frequent flyer awards that have been issued  are outstanding  and are expected to be redeemed at a future date 
frequent flyer account balances include points credits earned through flights taken  points sold to customers  or points credits earned through business partners participating in the company s frequent flyer program 

table of contents in march  southwest launched its all new rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
under the new program  members earn points for every dollar spent instead of credits for flight segments flown 
the amount of points earned is based on the fare and fare class purchased  with higher fare products eg  business select earning more points than lower fare products eg  wanna get away 
each fare class is associated with a points earning multiplier  and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier 
likewise  the amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight is based on the fare and fare class purchased 
however  unlike southwest s previous program  under the new program  i members are able to redeem their points for every available seat  every day  on every flight  with no blackout dates  and ii points do not expire so long as the rapid rewards member has points earning activity during a month time period 
in addition  southwest co branded chase visa credit card holders are able to redeem their points for items other than travel on southwest airlines  such as international flights  cruises  hotel stays  rental cars  gift cards  event tickets  and more 
in addition to earning points for revenue flights  rapid rewards members also have the ability to purchase points 
as part of southwest s transition to the new program  southwest did not convert members account balances under the previous program  but is allowing members to continue to redeem those balances for award travel under the prior program rules for a period of time 
airtran operates its a rewards frequent flyer program  which allows customers the opportunity to earn free roundtrip travel awards or business class upgrades on airtran flights 
a rewards credits are earned through flights  purchases made with an airtran airways a visa card  qualifying car rentals from hertz  purchases from other a rewards partners  and in conjunction with certain marketing promotions 
under certain circumstances  customers may also redeem frequent flyer awards for free travel on other airlines 
both southwest and airtran utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for points and or credits earned through flights taken in their respective frequent flyer programs 
a liability is recorded for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel as points and or credits are being earned 
the liability recorded represents the total number of points and or credits expected to be redeemed by members  regardless of whether the members may have enough to qualify for a full travel award 
the incremental cost liability is primarily composed of direct passenger costs such as fuel  food  and other operational costs  but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit 
at december   southwest and airtran s consolidated incremental cost liability  including both the liability remaining from southwest s previous program and the liability associated with its new frequent flyer program  was approximately million 
southwest and airtran also sell frequent flyer points and or credits and related services to business partners participating in the respective frequent flyer programs 
the majority of the points and or credits sold to business partners are through the southwest co branded chase visa credit card or the airtran a visa card 
funds received from the sale of points and or credits associated with these agreements are accounted for under the residual method 
although asu no 
revenue agreements with multiple deliverables disallows the use of the residual method with respect to new and modified revenue arrangements after its january   effective date  southwest and airtran are required to continue to utilize the residual method until such time as there is a material modification to such pre existing agreements 
as a result  the adoption of asu no 
currently has no impact on southwest or airtran 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on asu no 
under the residual method  as of december   southwest estimates that approximately percent of the amount received from frequent flyer points sold associated with southwest s co branded credit card relates to free travel  and the remaining percent is associated with items such as access to its frequent flyer program population for marketing solicitation purposes  use of the southwest s logo on the co branded credit cards  and other trademarks  designs  images  etc  of southwest for use in marketing materials 
this apportionment of value between free travel and marketing services is estimated based on several factors  including fares  the habits of customers in redeeming free travel awards  and the contractual rate received for the points sold 
prior to  the amount estimated to be associated with free travel had historically ranged from percent to percent 
the estimated amounts associated with free travel are deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the ultimate free travel awards are flown or the amounts expire unused 
for the portion of funds received that is deemed not to be associated with future travel  southwest 
table of contents has determined that the period revenue is recognized is the period in which it has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner  which is on a monthly or quarterly basis  upon sale  as the related marketing services are performed or provided 
the vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted  either monthly or quarterly  to various lists of southwest s frequent flyer members 
the estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in other revenue in the period earned 
for airtran  percent of amounts received for credits sold is estimated to relate to free travel and is deferred until the travel award is flown 
under its new program  southwest continues to estimate the portion of frequent flyer points that will not be redeemed 
these estimates are based on experience in its previous program and expectations of customer behavior given the rules of the new program 
however  since the program is new  these estimates may result in significant adjustments based on actual experience 
goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the company s acquisition of airtran on may   the company has reflected goodwill on its consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million at december   representing the excess of the fair value of airtran s assets and liabilities over its book value on the acquisition date 
in addition  the company carries other intangible assets totaling approximately million at december   primarily consisting of leasehold rights to airport gates  take off and landing slots at certain domestic slot controlled airports  and certain intangible assets recognized as part of the valuation of airtran s assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
all of the company s intangible assets are finite lived and are being amortized over their estimated economic useful lives 
goodwill is not amortized  but will be tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
the company has selected october as its annual testing date and performed its initial annual goodwill impairment test as of october  the company applies a fair value based methodology in testing the carrying value of goodwill for its one reporting unit 
key assumptions and or estimates made in the company s goodwill impairment test included the following a long term projection of revenues  expenses  and cash flows  an estimated weighted average cost of capital of percent  and a tax rate of percent 
the company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made 
however  actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the company s estimates 
future impairment of goodwill may result from changes in assumptions  estimates  or circumstances  some of which are beyond the company s control 
factors which could result in an impairment  holding other assumptions constant  could include  but are not limited to reduced passenger demand as a result of domestic or global economic conditions  higher prices for jet fuel  lower fares or passenger yields as a result of increased competition or lower demand  a significant increase in future capital expenditure commitments  and significant disruptions to the company s operations as a result of both internal and external events such as terrorist activities  actual or threatened war  labor actions by employees  or further industry regulation 
as a result of the tests performed during fourth quarter  no impairment was determined to exist for goodwill or any of the company s finite lived intangible assets 
in the goodwill impairment analysis performed  the excess of fair value versus carrying value was estimated to be between percent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet  and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program and in the form of fixed rate debt instruments 
as of december   southwest and 
table of contents airtran operated a total of aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  except for a small number of aircraft that have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates  the remainder of the leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
hedging the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
inclusive of the operations of airtran  the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this anticipated usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million for  excluding any impact associated with fuel derivative instruments held 
as of december   the company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that represented a hedge for a portion of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from through see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company may increase or decrease the size of its fuel hedge based on its expectation of future market prices  as well as its perceived exposure to cash collateral requirements contained in the agreements it has signed with various counterparties 
the gross fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   was a net liability of million 
in addition  a total of million in cash collateral has been provided by the company to three counterparties associated with these instruments 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december  for all years from through prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
in addition  this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties  which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount  depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december  levels  except underlying futures prices 
the company s credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the company 
at such times  these outstanding instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
as of december   the company had five counterparties in which the derivatives held were a net asset  totaling million 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
however  if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the company and were unable to meet their obligations  any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination  which could result in substantial losses for the company 
at december   the company had agreements with all of its counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterparty s credit rating 
the company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits 
table of contents and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the company  or cash and or aircraft could be posted by the company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the company 
refer to the counterparty credit risk and collateral table provided in note to the consolidated financial statements for the fair values of fuel derivatives  amounts posted as collateral  and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of december   at which such postings are triggered 
at december   of the entire million in cash collateral deposits posted with counterparties under the company s bilateral collateral provisions  million in cash collateral deposits has been netted against noncurrent fuel derivative instruments within other noncurrent liabilities and million in cash collateral deposits has been netted against current fuel derivative instruments within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
no aircraft were pledged as collateral at december  due to the terms of the company s current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties and the types of derivatives held  in the company s judgment  it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements 
as an example  if market prices for the commodities used in the company s fuel hedging activities were to decrease by one third from market prices as of december   given the company s fuel derivative portfolio  its aircraft collateral facilities  and its investment grade credit rating  it would likely provide an additional million in cash and or aircraft collateral to its current counterparties 
however  the company would expect to also benefit from lower market prices paid for fuel used in its operations 
the company is also subject to the risk that the fuel derivatives it uses to hedge against fuel price volatility do not provide adequate protection 
the majority of fuel derivatives in the company s hedge portfolio are based on the market price of west texas intermediate crude oil wti 
during early  the spread between wti and jet fuel widened beyond historic norms  which led to more ineffectiveness when measuring the company s hedges 
during that time  jet fuel prices more closely correlated with changes in the price of brent crude oil brent 
during fourth quarter  the spread between wti and jet fuel narrowed from its high  but still remains higher than historic norms  however  there is no assurance that this spread will not expand again in the future 
although the company has some fuel derivatives based on the price of brent  to the extent the spread between jet fuel and wti stays at current levels or widens from current levels  the company s hedges could continue to be ineffective and not provide adequate protection against jet fuel price volatility 
the company also has agreements with each of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements in which cash collateral may be required based on the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments  as well as the company s and its counterparty s credit ratings 
as of december   million had been provided to one counterparty associated with interest rate derivatives based on the company s outstanding net liability derivative position with that counterparty 
in addition  in connection with interest rate swaps entered into by airtran  a total of million in cash collateral had been provided to two counterparties at december   as a result of net liability derivative positions with those counterparties 
the outstanding interest rate net derivative positions with all other counterparties at december   were assets to the company 
due to the significance of the company s fuel hedging program and the emphasis that the company places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk  the company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels 
for example  the company has put in place controls designed to i create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy  ii provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management  iii provide for proper segregation of duties  iv maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments  and v have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities 
the company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program 

table of contents financial market risk the vast majority of the company s tangible assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions 
while the company uses financial leverage  it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a bbb rating with fitch  a bbb rating with standard poor s  and a baa credit rating with moody s as of december   which are considered investment grade 
the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings were originally issued as floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company and airtran have converted certain of their long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s  including airtran s  short term and long term debt 
as of december   excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate  the company s fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding included its million senior unsecured notes due and its million senior unsecured notes due both of these notes had previously been converted to floating rates  but in january  the company terminated the fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements related to them 
the effect of these terminations was that the interest associated with these debts prospectively reverted back to their original fixed rates 
as a result of the gains realized on these transactions  which will be amortized over the remaining term of the corresponding notes  and based on projected interest rates at the date of termination  the company does not believe its future interest expense  based on projected future interest rates at the date of termination  associated with these notes will significantly differ from the expense it would have recorded had the notes remained at floating rates 
although there is no longer interest rate risk associated with these notes  the company is now exposed to fair value risk over their remaining terms 
the company believes the fixed interest rates associated with its million senior unsecured notes due and its million senior unsecured notes due are comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the following table displays the characteristics of the company s including airtran s secured fixed rate debt as of december  principal amount in millions effective fixed rate final maturity underlying collateral term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft the carrying value of the company s  including airtran s  floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the year ended december  in total  the company s  including airtran s  fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of consolidated noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled million  and short term investments  which totaled billion  at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company currently invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  treasury securities  us government agency securities  and other highly rated financial instruments  depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements 
as a result of turmoil in credit markets  the company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 

table of contents a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s  including airtran s  fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on earnings and cash flows associated with the company s  including airtran s  floating rate debt  invested cash excluding cash collateral deposits held  if applicable  floating rate aircraft leases  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical percent change in those rates would have an immaterial impact to the company s net earnings and cash flows 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties  if applicable  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s  including airtran s  publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility  and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements  the pricing related to any funds drawn under its revolving credit facility  and some of its hedging counterparty agreements 
certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings 
the company s revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations  as defined 
as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility  there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility  or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written 
seven of the company s hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the company s credit rating were to fall below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies  and if the company were in a net liability position with the counterparty 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company had posted million in cash with its fuel hedge counterparties  because the company was in a net fuel hedge liability position with those counterparties 
the company had the option of substituting aircraft in lieu of million in cash as of december   but opted to provide cash instead 
if the company s credit rating had been below investment grade as of that date  the company would have been required to post approximately million in additional cash collateral deposits with fuel hedge counterparties 
the company currently has agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its customers utilizing american express  discover and mastercard visa 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because  although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time  and the processor will have liability if the company does not ultimately provide the air travel 
under these processing agreements  and based on specified conditions  increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty 
a majority of the company s sales transactions are processed by chase paymentech 
should chargebacks processed by chase paymentech reach a certain level  proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur 
additionally  cash reserves are required to be established if the company s credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade 
cash reserve requirements are based on the company s public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the company s air traffic liability 

table of contents as of december   the company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements 
however  the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future
