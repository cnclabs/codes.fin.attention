executive overview grain business the grain business operates grain elevators in various states  primarily in the us corn belt 
in addition to storage  merchandising and grain trading  grain performs marketing  risk management  and corn origination services to its customers and affiliated ethanol production facilities 
grain is a significant investor in lansing trade group  llc ltg  an established commodity trading  grain handling and merchandising business with operations throughout the country and with global trading merchandising offices 
the agricultural commodity based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices 
therefore  increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the business deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a much less significant impact on gross profit 
as a result  changes in sales for the period may not necessarily be indicative of the overall performance of the business and more focus should be placed on changes to merchandising revenues and service income 
grain inventories on hand at december  were million bushels  of which million bushels were stored for others 
this compares to million bushels on hand at december   of which million bushels were stored for others 
at december   grain had a significant number of bushels on delivery bushels physically sold to a customer for which the company no longer has ownership of with the cme  which was not the case at december  during  grain increased its storage capacity by approximately million bushels through grain merchandising and handling agreements and expansion at existing locations 
the total storage capacity is approximately million bushels as of december  compared to million bushels at december  the grain group is currently constructing a grain shuttle loader facility in anselmo  nebraska 
the million bushel capacity grain elevator will primarily handle corn and soybeans and is expected to open in the fall of looking ahead  increased corn acres without a corresponding drop in yields will likely lead to lower corn and grain commodity prices

grain inventories are up million over prior year due to owning the majority of the wheat in our facilities rather than storing it for others as in the prior year along with an increase in ownership bushels in beans 
plant nutrient inventories are up million over prior year due to higher volumes and cost of raw materials 
trade receivables fluctuate with timing of sales along with variations in prices of commodities 
the increase in accounts receivable is consistent with the increase in sales and merchandising revenues 
restricted cash increased due to a new industrial development revenue bond 
see the discussion below on sources and uses of cash for an understanding of the decrease in cash from prior year 
current liabilities decreased primarily as a result of lower borrowings on our short term line of credit used to fund other components of working capital 
commodity derivative liabilities also decreased due to falling commodity prices in the second half of these decreases were partially offset by a large increase in accounts payable for grain attributed to higher hold pay for corn grain we have purchased but not yet paid for and the increase in other accounts payable which is consistent with the increase in cost of sales and merchandising revenues 
other current liabilities increased primarily due to the increase in performance incentive accruals 
borrowings and credit facilities on december   the company entered into a restated loan agreement the agreement with several financial institutions  including us bank national association  acting as agent

purchases of railcars were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of railcars in the amount of million 
capital spending for on property  plant and equipment includes grain million  plant nutrient million  rail million  turf specialty million  retail million and million in corporate purchases

table of contents the company has significant committed short term lines of credit available to finance working capital  primarily inventories  margin calls on commodity contracts and accounts receivable 
as noted above  the company is party to a borrowing arrangement with a syndicate of banks  which was amended in december  to provide the company with million in short term lines of credit 
the company had drawn million on its short term line of credit at december  compared to million at december  peak borrowing on the line of credit during and were million and million  respectively 
typically  the company s highest borrowing occurs in the spring due to seasonal inventory requirements in the fertilizer and retail businesses  credit sales of fertilizer and a customary reduction in grain payables due to the cash needs and market strategies of grain customers 
certain of the company s long term borrowings include covenants that  among other things  impose minimum levels of equity and limitations on additional debt 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in addition  certain of the company s long term borrowings are collateralized by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets

in addition  the company repurchased treasury shares in the amount of million 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its exchange traded futures contracts 
conversely  in periods of declining prices  the company receives a return of cash 
the volatility in the capital and credit markets has had a significant impact on the economy in the past few years 
despite the volatile and challenging economic environment  the company has continued to have good access to the credit markets 
in the unlikely event that the company was faced with a situation where it was not able to access the capital markets including through the renewal of its line of credit  the company believes it could successfully implement contingency plans to maintain adequate liquidity such as expanding or contracting the amount of its forward grain contracting  which will reduce the impact of grain price volatility on its daily margin calls 
additionally  the company could begin to liquidate its stored grain inventory as well as execute sales contracts with its customers that align the timing of the receipt of grain from its producers to the shipment of grain to its customers thereby freeing up working capital that is typically utilized to store the grain for extended periods of time 
the company could also raise equity through other portions of the capital market 
the company believes that its operating cash flow  the marketability of its grain inventories  other liquidity contingency plans and its access to sufficient sources of liquidity  will enable it to meet its ongoing funding requirements 
at december   the company had million available under its lines of credit

critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may change from estimates 
certain of the company s accounting estimates are considered critical  as they are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  however  they are not deemed critical as defined above 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item describes our significant accounting policies which should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting estimates 
the company believes that accounting for fair value adjustment for counterparty risk  grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments and impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments involve significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
fair value adjustment for counterparty risk the company records estimated fair value adjustments to its commodity contracts on a quarterly basis 
these market value adjustments for customer credit exposure are based on internal projections  the company s historical experience with its producers and customers and the company s knowledge of the counterparties business 
in addition  the adjustments to contract fair values fluctuate with the rise and fall of commodity prices 

table of contents grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain and ethanol  over the counter grain and ethanol contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the overall market for grain inventories is very liquid and active  market value is determined by reference to prices for identical commodities on the cme adjusted primarily for transportation costs  and the company s grain inventories may be sold without significant additional processing 
the company uses forward purchase and sale contracts and both exchange traded and over the counter contracts such as derivatives generally used by the international swap dealers association 
management estimates fair value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets  as well as counter party non performance risk in the case of forward and over the counter contracts 
the amount of risk  and therefore the impact to the fair value of the contracts  varies by type of contract and type of counter party 
with the exception of specific customers thought to be at higher risk  the company looks at the contracts in total  segregated by contract type  in its assessment of non performance risk 
for those customers that are thought to be at higher risk  the company makes assumptions as to performance based on past history and facts about the current situation 
changes in fair value are recorded as a component of sales and merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the company records its non grain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventory compared to the current market 
market price is determined using both external data  such as current selling prices by third parties and quoted trading prices for the same or similar products  and internal data  such as the company s current ask price and expectations on normal margins 
if the evaluation indicates that the company s inventory is being carried at values higher than the current market can support  the company will write down its inventory to its best estimate of net realizable value 
impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments the company s business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or railcars 
fixed assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
this is done by evaluating the recoverability based on undiscounted projected cash flows  excluding interest 
if an asset group is considered impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
historically  these reviews for impairment have taken into account our quantitative estimates of future cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
the majority of our goodwill is in the grain and plant nutrient businesses 
based on the strength of performance in both of these groups  a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed in the current year versus the traditional quantitative assessment 
key factors considered in the qualitative assessment included  but were not limited to industry and market specific factors  the competitive environment  comparison of the prior year actual results relative to budgeted performance  current financial performance  and managements forecast for future financial performance 
these factors are discussed in more detail in note  goodwill and intangible assets 
in addition  the company holds investments in limited liability companies that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company reviews its investments to determine whether there has been a decline in the estimated fair value of the investment that is below the company s carrying value which is other than temporary 
other than consideration of past and current performance  these reviews take into account forecasted earnings which are based on management s estimates of future performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the company s daily net commodity position consists of inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded futures and over the counter contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
the company has established controls to manage risk exposure  which consists of daily review of position limits and effects of potential market prices moves on those positions 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted market prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december  in thousands net position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates and credit ratings for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december  in thousands fair value of long term debt fair value in excess of carrying value market risk actual results may differ 
the estimated fair value and market risk will vary from year to year depending on the total amount of long term debt and the mix of variable and fixed rate debt
