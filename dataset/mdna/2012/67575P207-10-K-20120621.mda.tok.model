item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a commercial healthcare company that designs  produces  and markets innovative  safe and effective drugs  devices  and nutritional products 
we are pioneering innovative products for the dermatology  surgical  wound care  and animal healthcare markets 
our primary focus is on our proprietary technology platform called microcyn technology 
this technology is based on electrically charged oxychlorine small molecules designed to target a wide range of organisms that cause disease pathogens 
these include viruses  fungi  spores and antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria  such as methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus  or mrsa  and vancomycin resistant enterococcus  or vre  in wounds  as well as clostridium difficile  or c 
diff  a highly contagious bacteria spread by human contact 
several microcyn technology tissue care products are designed to treat infections and enhance healing while reducing the need for antibiotics 
infection is a serious potential complication in both chronic and acute wounds  and controlling infection is a critical step in wound healing 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to exercise its judgment 
we exercise considerable judgment with respect to establishing sound accounting policies and in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  our recognition of revenues and expenses  and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
areas in which we exercise significant judgment include  but are not necessarily limited to  our valuation of accounts receivable  inventory  income taxes  equity transactions compensatory and financing and contingencies 
we have also adopted certain polices with respect to our recognition of revenue that we believe are consistent with the guidance provided under securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
we base our estimates and judgments on a variety of factors including our historical experience  knowledge of our business and industry  current and expected economic conditions  the attributes of our products  the regulatory environment  and in certain cases  the results of outside appraisals 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates and assumptions with respect to these judgments and modify our approach when circumstances indicate that modifications are necessary 
while we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies  we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate 
since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment  actual results could differ from such estimates 
a description of significant accounting policies that require us to make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is as follows stock based compensation we account for share based awards exchanged for employee services based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
we amortize the fair value of employee stock options on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards 
compensation expense includes the impact of an estimate for forfeitures for all stock options 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees at their fair value on the measurement date 
the measurement of stock based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instrument vests or becomes non forfeitable 
non employee stock based compensation charges are amortized over the vesting period or as earned 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable we generate revenue from sales of our products to hospitals  medical centers  doctors  pharmacies  and distributors 
we sell our products directly to third parties and to distributors through various cancelable distribution agreements 
we also entered into agreements to license our technology and products 
we also provide regulatory compliance testing and quality assurance services to medical device and pharmaceutical companies 
we record revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability of the sale is reasonably assured 
we require all of our product sales to be supported by evidence of a sale transaction that clearly indicates the selling price to the customer  shipping terms and payment terms 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of a contract or purchase order approved by the customer 
we have ongoing relationships with certain customers from which it customarily accepts orders by telephone in lieu of purchase orders 
we recognize revenue at the time in which we receive confirmation that the goods were either tendered at their destination  when shipped fob destination  or transferred to a shipping agent  when shipped fob shipping point 
delivery to the customer is deemed to have occurred when the customer takes title to the product 
generally  title passes to the customer upon shipment  but could occur when the customer receives the product based on the terms of the agreement with the customer 
the selling prices of all goods are fixed  and agreed to with the customer  prior to shipment 
selling prices are generally based on established list prices 
we do not customarily permit our customers to return any products for monetary refunds or credit against completed or future sales 
we may  from time to time  replace expired goods on a discretionary basis 
we record these types of adjustments  when made  as a reduction of revenue 
sales adjustments were insignificant during the years ended march  and we evaluate the creditworthiness of new customers and monitors the creditworthiness of its existing customers to determine whether events or changes in their financial circumstances would raise doubt as to the collectability of a sale at the time in which a sale is made 
payment terms on sales made in the united states are generally days and internationally  generally range from days to days 
in the event a sale is made to a customer under circumstances in which collectability is not reasonably assured  we either require the customer to remit payment prior to shipment or defer recognition of the revenue until payment is received 
we maintain a reserve for amounts which may not be collectible due to risk of credit losses 
additionally  we defer recognition of revenue related to distributors that are unable to provide inventory or product sell through reports on a timely basis  until payment is received 
we believe the receipt of payment is the best indication of product sell through 
we have entered into distribution agreements in europe 
recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue from product sales is deferred until the product is sold from the distributors to their customers 
when we receive letters of credit and the terms of the sale provide for no right of return except to replace defective product  revenue is recognized when the letter of credit becomes effective and the product is shipped 
license revenue is generated through agreements with strategic partners for the commercialization of microcyn products 
the terms of the agreements sometimes include non refundable upfront fees 
we analyze multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated 
analysis is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each product is delivered 
if a product or service is not separable  the combined deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized over the performance obligation period 
assuming the elements meet the criteria for separation and all other revenue requirements for recognition  the revenue recognition methodology prescribed for each unit of accounting is summarized below when appropriate  we defer recognition of non refundable upfront fees 
if we have continuing performance obligations then such up front fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement 
we recognize royalty revenues from licensed products upon the sale of the related products 
revenue from consulting contracts is recognized as services are provided 
revenue from testing contracts is recognized as tests are completed and a final report is sent to the customer 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost  cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
due to changing market conditions  estimated future requirements  age of the inventories on hand and production of new products  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
income taxes we are required to determine the aggregate amount of income tax expense or loss based upon tax statutes in jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in making these estimates  we adjust our results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from these differences are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences in loss and credit carryforwards that will reverse in subsequent years 
we also establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based  in part  on predictions that management must make as to our results in future periods 
the outcome of events could differ over time which would require that we make changes in our valuation allowance 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates and assumptions include reserves and write downs related to receivables and inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets  deferred taxes and related valuation allowances  and valuation of equity and derivative instruments and debt discounts 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu addresses fair value measurement and disclosure requirements within accounting standards codification asc topic for the purpose of providing consistency and common meaning between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
generally  this asu is not intended to change the application of the requirements in topic rather  this asu primarily changes the wording to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this asu is effective for periods beginning after december  it did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu increases the prominence of other comprehensive income oci in the financial statements and provides companies two options for presenting oci  which until now has typically been placed within the statement of equity 
one option allows an oci statement to be included with the net income statement  and together the two will make a statement of total comprehensive income 
alternately  companies may present an oci statement separate from the net income statement  however  the two statements will have to appear consecutively within a financial report 
this asu does not affect the types of items that are reported in oci  nor does it affect the calculation or presentation of earnings per share 
for public companies  this asu is effective for periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb  sec and or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption
