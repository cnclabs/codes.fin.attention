table of contents overview we were incorporated in delaware on april  and were initially funded on july  our investment objective is to provide a combination of current income and capital appreciation 
we intend to invest primarily in debt and equity securities of private and certain public us middle market companies 
we are externally managed and have elected to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
as a bdc  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
as a bdc  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
under the relevant sec rules  the term eligible portfolio company includes all private companies and companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange  as well as certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than million 
these rules also permit us to include as qualifying assets certain follow on investments in companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time of initial investment but that no longer meet the definition 
revenues we generate revenues primarily in the form of interest on the debt we hold  dividends on our equity interests and capital gains on the sale of warrants and other debt or equity interests that we acquire in portfolio companies 
our investments in fixed income instruments generally have an expected maturity of three to ten years  although we have no lower or upper constraint on maturity  and typically bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semi annually 
payments of principal of our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment  deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity 
in some cases  our debt instruments and preferred stock investments may defer payments of cash interest or dividends or pay interest or dividends in kind 
any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees  commitment  origination  capital structuring or due diligence fees  fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees 
with respect to dividends paid to stockholders  certain income we receive from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies may cause our taxable income to exceed our gaap income although the differences are expected to be temporary in nature 
expenses our primary operating expenses include the payment of a base management fee and  depending on our operating results  an incentive management fee  expenses reimbursable under the management agreement  administration fees and the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement 
the base management fee and incentive management fee compensate the advisor for work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
our management agreement with the advisor provides that we will reimburse the advisor for costs and expenses incurred by the advisor for office space rental  office 
table of contents equipment and utilities allocable to the advisor under the management agreement  as well as any costs and expenses incurred by the advisor relating to any non investment advisory  administrative or operating services provided by the advisor to us 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to our organization  calculating our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms  expenses incurred by the advisor payable to third parties in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  the costs of future offerings of common shares and other securities  if any  the base management fee and any incentive management fee  dividends and distributions on our preferred shares  if any  and common shares  administration fees payable under the administration agreement  fees payable to third parties relating to  or associated with  making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  registration fees  listing fees  taxes  independent director fees and expenses  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  the costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders  including printing costs  our fidelity bond  our allocable portion of directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  indemnification payments  direct costs and expenses of administration  including audit and legal costs  and all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the administrator in connection with administering our business  such as the allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement  including rent and other allocable portions of the cost of certain of our officers and their respective staffs 
additionally  the management agreement provides that the advisor or its affiliates may be entitled to the incentive fee under certain circumstances 
the determination of the incentive fee will result in the advisor or its affiliates receiving no incentive fee payments if returns to our stockholders do not meet an annualized rate of return and will result in the advisor or its affiliates receiving less than the full amount of the incentive fee percentage until returns to stockholders exceed an approximate annualized rate of return 
annualized rate of return in this context is computed by reference to our net asset value and does not take into account changes in the market price of our common stock 
the determination of the incentive fee is subject to any applicable limitations under the act and the advisers act 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these 
table of contents consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ 
management considers the following critical accounting policies important to understanding the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of significant accounting policies and of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
valuation of portfolio investments investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we obtain market quotations  when available  from an independent pricing service or one or more broker dealers or market makers and utilize the average of the range of bid and ask quotations 
debt and equity securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio  we expect to value substantially all of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith under the direction of our board of directors using a consistently applied valuation process in accordance with a documented valuation policy that has been reviewed and approved by our board of directors 
due to the inherent uncertainty and subjectivity of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that we may ultimately realize 
in addition  changes in the market environment and other events may have differing impacts on the market quotations used to value some of our investments than on the fair values of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available 
market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value in certain circumstances where the advisor believes that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer  a seller or purchaser or the market for a particular security cause current market quotations to not reflect the fair value of the security 
examples of these events could include cases where a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale  where there is a forced sale by a distressed seller  where market quotations vary substantially among market makers  or where there is a wide bid ask spread or significant increase in the bid ask spread 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially evaluated and rated by the investment professionals of the advisor responsible for the portfolio investment  the investment professionals provide recent portfolio company financial statements and other reporting materials to independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors  such firms conduct independent appraisals each quarter and their preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with senior management of the advisor  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations prepared by the independent valuation firms  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the advisor  the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
those investments for which market quotations are not readily available or for which market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value are valued utilizing a market approach  an income approach  or both 
table of contents approaches  as appropriate 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in determining the fair value of our investments include  as relevant and among other factors available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  our principal market as the reporting entity and enterprise values 
until the end of the second calendar quarter following its acquisition  each unquoted investment in a new portfolio company generally is valued at cost  which the advisor believes approximates fair value under the circumstances 
as of that date  an independent valuation firm conducts an initial independent appraisal of the investment 
accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc defines fair value as the price that a company would receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction to a market participant in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment 
asc emphasizes that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  including assumptions about risk 
inputs may be observable or unobservable 
observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of us 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
asc establishes a hierarchy that classifies these inputs into the three broad levels listed below level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a company has the ability to access 
level valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation 
transfers between levels  if any  represent the value as of the beginning of the period of any investment where a change in the pricing level occurred from the beginning to the end of the period 
our valuation policy and fair value disclosures are consistent with asc we evaluate the source of inputs  including any markets in which our investments are trading  in determining fair value and categorize each investment within the fair value hierarchy pursuant to asc determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates 
accordingly  the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations  and any change in such valuations  on the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we record interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and securities with payment in kind pik income  which represents contractual interest or dividends accrued and added to the principal balance and generally due at maturity  such income is accrued only to the extent that the advisor believes that the pik income is likely to be collected 
we may not accrue pik income if the advisor believes that the pik income is not collectible 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition asc  which establishes the considerations with respect to recognition of revenue and gains  structuring service fees  origination  closing  commitment and other upfront fees are recognized as revenue when earned 
for gaap purposes these fees may be recognized upfront or may be amortized 
for tax purposes these fees are generally recognized upfront 
this may result in income being recorded as gaap income over the life of a portfolio investment and as taxable income when received 
for the years ended december   and  as reported under gaap  investment income included capital structuring fees and related amortization of   and  for the years ended december   and taxable income included capital structuring fee income generated from new investments  of   and zero 
in addition  included in gaap and taxable income are fees generated from partially and fully exited portfolio investments of   and  for the years ended december   and net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering upfront fees and prepayment fees 
realized gains and losses are computed using the specific identification method 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
federal income taxes we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code and currently qualify  and intend to continue to qualify each year  as a ric under the code 
in order to qualify as a ric  we are required to distribute annually at least of investment company taxable income  as defined by the code  to our stockholders 
to avoid federal excise taxes  we must distribute annually at least of our ordinary income and of our net capital gains from the current year and any undistributed ordinary income and net capital gains from the preceding years 
we may  at our discretion  carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a excise tax on this income 
if we choose to do so  all other things being equal  this would increase expenses and reduce the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders

table of contents tax characteristics of all dividends are reported to stockholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
in order to maintain favorable ric tax treatment  we must distribute annually to our stockholders at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
under the regulated investment company modernization act of  capital losses incurred by the company after december  will not be subject to expiration 
in addition  such losses must be utilized prior to the losses incurred in the years preceding enactment 
in order to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we must distribute during each calendar year an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october st  and any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
we may  at our discretion  carry forward taxable income in excess of calendar year distributions and pay a excise tax on this income 
if we choose to do so  all other things being equal  this would increase expenses and reduce the amounts available to be distributed to our stockholders 
we accrue excise tax on estimated taxable income as required 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
there was no provision for federal excise taxes recorded for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we recorded a provision for federal excise taxes of  and  respectively 
there was no undistributed taxable income carried forward from we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
with respect to our dividends and distributions paid to stockholders during the years ended december   and  dividends reinvested pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan totaled   and  respectively 
under the terms of an amendment to our dividend reinvestment plan adopted on march   dividends may be paid in newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock at a price equal to of the market price on the dividend payment date 
this feature of the plan means that  under certain circumstances  we may issue shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  which could cause our stockholders to experience dilution 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
also  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a bdc under the act and due to provisions in our existing and future debt arrangements 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of favorable ric tax treatment 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a ric and may be subject to an excise tax 
in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirement applicable to rics  we have the ability to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of our common stock instead of in cash 
as long as a portion of 
table of contents such dividend is paid in cash which portion can be as low as for our taxable years ending prior to and certain requirements are met  the entire distribution would be treated as a dividend for us federal income tax purposes 
with respect to dividends paid to stockholders  certain income we receive from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies may cause our taxable income to exceed our gaap income although the differences are expected to be temporary in nature 
recent developments on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share  payable on april  to stockholders of record at the close of business on march  notice is hereby given in accordance with section c of the act that from time to time the company may purchase shares of its common stock in the open market at prevailing market prices

the interest rates on such investments generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months 
at december   the percentage of our total debt investments that bore floating rate interest subject to an interest rate floor was 
floating rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to six months only if the index exceeds the floor 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates  we have performed the following analysis based on our december  balance sheet and assuming no changes in our investment structure 
net asset value is analyzed using the assumptions that interest rates  as defined by the libor and us treasury yield curves  increase or decrease and that the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
under this analysis  an instantaneous basis point increase in libor and us treasury yields would cause a decline of approximately  or per share  in the value of our net assets at december  and a corresponding basis point decrease in libor and us treasury yields would cause an increase of approximately  or per share  in the value of our net assets on that date 
while hedging activities may help to insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they also may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the years ended december   and  we did not engage in any interest rate hedging activity
