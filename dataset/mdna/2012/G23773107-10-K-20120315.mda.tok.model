in  oc bvi completed the construction of a  us gallons per day plant at bar bay  tortola  in the british virgin islands 
this plant began supplying water to the bvi government in january the definitive contract for the sale of water from this plant was signed on march  the contract has a term of seven years with a seven year renewal option exercisable by the bvi government 
we purchase electrical power to operate this plant from bvi electric co 
and operate diesel engine driven emergency power generators when bvi electric co 
is unable to provide power to the plant 
oc bvi s plant on the island of jost van dyke has a capacity of  us gallons per day 
this plant operates under a contract with the bvi government that expires july  we purchase electrical power to operate this plant from bvi electric co 
reverse osmosis technology the conversion of seawater to potable water is called desalination 
the two primary forms of desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis 
both methods are used throughout the world and technologies are improving to lower the costs of production 
reverse osmosis is a fluid separation process in which the saline water is pressurized and the fresh water is separated from the saline water by passing through a semi permeable membrane which rejects the salts 
the saline water ie seawater is first passed through a pretreatment system  which generally consists of fine filtration and treatment chemicals  if required 
pre treatment removes suspended solids and organics which could cause fouling of the membrane surface 
next  a high pressure pump pressurizes the saline water thus enabling approximately conversion of the saline water to fresh water as it passes through the membrane  while more than of the dissolved salts are rejected and remain in the now concentrated saline water 
this remaining feed water which has now been concentrated is discharged without passing through the membrane 
the remaining hydraulic energy in the concentrated feed water is transferred to the initial saline feed water with an energy recovery device thus reducing the total energy requirement for the reverse osmosis system 
the final step is post treatment  which consists of stabilizing the produced fresh water  thereby removing undesirable dissolved gases  adjusting the ph and providing chlorination to prepare it for distribution 
we use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water at all of the plants we construct and operate 
we believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our market 
however  we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new  more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water 
the equipment at our plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain the equipment in an efficient manner 
as a result of our decades of experience in seawater desalination  we believe that we have an expertise in the development and operation of desalination plants which is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas 
raw materials and sources of supply all materials  parts and supplies essential to our business operations are obtained from multiple sources and we use the latest industry technology 
we do not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business 
our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we have our operations 
seasonal variations in our business our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize  and the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
government regulations  custom duties and taxes our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate 
the following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses 
legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future 
any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results 
the cayman islands the cayman islands are a british overseas territory and have had a stable political climate since  when the treaty of madrid ceded the cayman islands to england 
the queen of england appoints the governor of the cayman islands to make laws with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly 
the legislative assembly consists of elected members and three members appointed by the governor from the civil service 
the cabinet is responsible for day to day government operations 
the cabinet consists of five ministers who are chosen by the legislative assembly from its popularly elected members  and the three civil service members 
the elected members choose from among themselves a leader  who is designated the premier  and is in effect the leader of the elected government 
the governor has reserved powers and the united kingdom retains full control over foreign affairs and defense 
the cayman islands are a common law jurisdiction and have adopted a legal system similar to that of the united kingdom 
the cayman islands have no taxes on profits  income  distributions  capital gains or appreciation 
we have exemptions from  or receive concessionaire rates of customs duties on capital expenditures for plant and major consumable spare parts and supplies imported into the cayman islands as follows we do not pay import duty or taxes on reverse osmosis membranes  electric pumps and motors and chemicals  but we do pay duty at the rate of of the cost  including insurance and transportation to the cayman islands  of other plant and associated materials and equipment to manufacture or supply water in the seven mile beach or west bay areas 
we have been advised by the government of the cayman islands that we will not receive any duty concessions in our new retail water license  and oc cayman pays full customs duties in respect of all plants that it operates for the water authority cayman 
the stamp tax on the transfer of ownership of land in the cayman islands is a major source of revenue to the cayman islands government 
to prevent stamp tax avoidance by transfer of ownership of the shares of a company which owns land in the cayman islands as opposed to transfer of the land itself  the land holding companies share transfer tax law was passed in the effect of this law is to charge a company  which owns land or an interest in land in the cayman islands  a tax based on the value of its land or interest in land attributable to each share transferred 
the stamp tax calculation does not take into account the proportion which the value of a company s cayman land or interest in land bears to its total assets and whether the intention of the transfer is to transfer ownership of part of a company s entire business or a part of its cayman land or interest in land 
prior to our common shares becoming publicly traded in the united states  we paid this tax on private share transfers 
we have never paid the tax on transfers of our publicly traded shares and requested an exemption in on april   we received notice that the cayman islands government had granted an exemption from taxation for all transfers of our shares 
we believe it is unlikely that government will seek to collect this tax on transfers of our publicly traded shares during through april  the bahamas the commonwealth of the bahamas is an independent nation and a constitutional parliamentary democracy with the queen of england as the constitutional head of state 
the basis of the bahamian law and legal system is the english common law tradition with a supreme court  court of appeals  and a magistrates court 
under the current laws of the commonwealth of the bahamas  no income  corporation  capital gains or other taxes are payable by the company 
the company is required to pay an annual business license fee the calculation of which is based on the company s preceding year s financial statements which to date has not been material to the results of our bahamas operations

the government of belize has exempted cw belize from certain customs duties and all revenue replacement duties until april   and had exempted cw belize from company taxes until january  belize levies a gross receipts tax on corporations at a rate varying between and  depending on the type of business  and a corporate income tax at a rate of of chargeable income 
gross receipts tax payable amounts are credited towards corporate income tax 
the government of belize also implemented certain environmental taxes and a general sales tax effective july  and increased certain business and personal taxes and created new taxes effective march  belize levies import duty on most imported items at rates varying between and  with most items attracting a rate of 
in  it was determined that the tax exemption was no longer valid and cw belize paid approximately  of business and corporate income tax for the period through under the terms of our water supply agreement with bwsl we are reimbursed by bwsl for all taxes and customs duties that we are required to pay and we record this reimbursement as an offset to our tax expense

market and service area although we currently operate in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  and the bahamas  we believe that our potential market consists of any location where there is a need for potable water 
the desalination of seawater  either through distillation or reverse osmosis  is the most widely used process for producing fresh water in areas with an insufficient natural supply 
we believe our experience in the development and operation of reverse osmosis desalination plants provides us with a significant opportunity to successfully expand our operations beyond the markets in which we currently operate 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman  which are not within our licensed area  as well as to little cayman and cayman brac 
we operate all the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by the water authority cayman on grand cayman and supply water under licenses and supply agreements held by oc cayman with the water authority cayman 
according to the most recent information published by the economics and statistics office of the cayman islands government  the population of the cayman islands was estimated in december to be approximately  according to the figures published by the department of tourism statistics information center  during the year ended december   tourist air arrivals increased by and tourist cruise ship arrivals decreased by compared to total visitors for the year decreased from million in to million in we believe that our water sales in the cayman islands are more positively impacted by stay over tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship  since cruise ship tourists generally only remain on the island for one day or less and do not remain on the island overnight 
at this time  we believe the stay over trend will continue through our current operations in belize are located on ambergris caye  which consists of residential  commercial and tourist properties in the town of san pedro 
this town is located on the southern end of ambergris caye 
ambergris caye is one of many islands located east of the belize mainland and off the southeastern tip of the yucatan peninsula 
ambergris caye is approximately miles long and  according to the central statistical office belize national census overview  has a population of about  residents 
we provide bulk potable water to bwsl  which distributes this water to this market 
bwsl currently has no other source of potable water on ambergris caye 
our contract with bwsl makes us their exclusive producer of desalinated water on ambergris caye through a mile long barrier reef  which is the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere  is situated just offshore of ambergris caye 
this natural attraction is becoming a choice destination for scuba divers and tourists 
according to information published by the belize trade and investment development service  tourism is belize s second largest source of foreign income  next to agriculture 
our current operations in the bahamas are located on south bimini island and in nassau on new providence 
the bimini islands consist of north bimini and south bimini  and are two of islands which comprise the bahamas 
the bimini islands are located approximately miles east of ft 
lauderdale  florida and are a premier destination for sport fishing enthusiasts 
the population of the bimini islands is approximately  persons and the islands have about hotel and guest rooms available for tourists 
the total land area of the bimini islands is approximately square miles 
new providence  lyford caye and paradise island  connected by several bridges  are located approximately miles east southeast of the bimini islands 
with an area of square miles and a population of approximately  nassau is the political capital and commercial hub of the bahamas  and accounts for more than two thirds of the million tourists who visit the bahamas annually 
the british virgin islands are a british overseas territory and are situated east of puerto rico 
they consist of inhabited and more than uninhabited islands  of which tortola is the largest and most populated island 
the islands are the center for many large yacht chartering businesses 
competition cayman islands 
pursuant to our license granted by the cayman islands government  we have the exclusive right to provide potable  piped water within our licensed service area on grand cayman 
at the present time  we are the only non government owned public water utility on grand cayman 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman located outside of our licensed service area 
although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area  our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the cayman island government 
private residences and commercial multi unit dwellings up to four units may install water making equipment for their own use 
water plants on premises within our license area and serving only their premises in existence prior to can be maintained but not replaced or expanded 
we are aware of only one such plant currently in operation 
the cayman islands government  through the water authority cayman  supplies water to parts of grand cayman outside of our licensed service area 
we have competed with such companies as ge water  veolia  and ide for bulk water supply contracts with the water authority cayman 
belize 
on ambergris caye in belize  our water supply contract with belize water services limited is exclusive  and belize water services limited can no longer seek contracts with other water suppliers  or produce water themselves  to meet their future needs in san pedro  ambergris caye  belize 
the bahamas 
on south bimini island in the bahamas  we supply water to a private developer and do not have competitors 
ge water operates a seawater desalination plant on north bimini island 
we competed with companies such as ge water  veolia  ide  ohl inima and biwater for the new contract with the bahamian government to build and operate a seawater desalination plant at blue hills  new providence  bahamas 
we expect to compete with these companies and others for future water supply contracts in the bahamas 
british virgin islands 
in the british virgin islands  ge water operates seawater desalination plants in west end and sea cows bay  tortola  and on virgin gorda and generally bids against oc bvi for projects 
biwater plc was recently awarded a year contract to construct and operate a million us gallon per day desalination plant in tortola for the british virgin islands government 
to implement our growth strategy outside our existing operating areas  we will have to compete with some of the same companies we competed with for the blue hills project in nassau  bahamas such as ge water  veolia  ide technologies  ohl inima  and biwater as well as other smaller companies 
some of these companies currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our operations and already maintain worldwide operations having greater financial  managerial and other resources than our company 
we believe that our low overhead costs  knowledge of local markets and conditions and our efficient manner of operating desalinated water production and distribution equipment provide us with the capabilities to effectively compete for new projects in the caribbean basin and other select markets 
environmental and health regulatory matters cayman islands

we are licensed by the government to discharge concentrated seawater  which is a byproduct of our desalination process  into deep disposal wells 
our cayman islands license requires that our potable water quality meet the world health organization s guidelines for drinking water quality and contain less than mg l of total dissolved solids 
belize  the bahamas  british virgin islands 
with respect to our belize and bahamas operations and oc bvi s british virgin islands operations  we and oc bvi are required by our water supply contracts to take all reasonable measures to prevent pollution of the environment 
we are licensed by the belize and bahamian governments to discharge concentrated seawater  which is a byproduct of our desalination process  into deep disposal wells 
oc bvi is licensed by the british virgin islands government to discharge concentrated seawater into the sea 
we operate our plants in a manner so as to minimize the emission of hydrogen sulfide gas into the environment 
we are not aware of any existing or pending environmental legislation which may affect our operations 
to date we have not received any complaints from any regulatory authorities 
employees as of march   we employed a total of persons  in the cayman islands  in the bahamas  in the united states and seven in belize

our exclusive license to provide water to retail customers in the cayman islands may not be renewed in the future 
in the cayman islands  we provide water to retail customers under a year license issued to us in july by the cayman islands government that grants us the exclusive right to provide water to retail customers within our licensed service area 
our service area is comprised of an area on grand cayman that includes the seven mile beach and west bay areas  two of the three most populated areas in the cayman islands 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately of our consolidated revenues and of our consolidated gross profits from the retail water operations conducted pursuant to our exclusive license 
if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government offers to any third party 
this license was set to expire on july   however we and the cayman islands government have agreed in correspondence to extend the license seven times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement 
we were advised by letter dated february  from water authority cayman that the government had approved an extension of the license until june  we are currently waiting for the government to execute such license extension 
on february   the water production and supply law  which replaces the water production and supply law revision under which the company is licensed and the water authority amendment law  the new laws were published on terms that they would come into force on such date as may be appointed by order made by the governor in cabinet 
such order was subsequently made by cabinet and the new laws are now in full force and effect 
under the new laws  the water authority cayman would issue any new license which could include a rate of return on invested capital model described below 
we have been informed during our retail license renewal negotiations conducted with representatives of the cayman islands government that the cayman islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license to employ a rate of return on invested capital model similar to that governing the sale of water to many us municipalities 
we have formally objected to the implementation of a rate of return on invested capital model on the basis that we believe that such a model would not promote the efficient operation of our water utility and could ultimately increase water rates to our customers 
we believe such a model  if ultimately implemented  could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the million carrying value of our retail segment s goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
if a new long term license agreement is not entered into with the government  we would retain a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government might offer in the future to a third party 
if we do not enter into a new license agreement  and no other party is awarded a license  we expect to be permitted to continue to supply water to our service area 
however  the terms of such continued supply may not be as favorable to us as the terms in the july  license agreement 
it is possible that the government could offer a third party a license to service some or all of our present service area 
in such event  we may assume the license offered to the third party by exercising our right of first refusal 
the terms of the new license agreement may not be as favorable to us as the terms under which we are presently operating and could reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the million carrying value of our retail segment s goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
the value of our investment in our affiliate oc bvi is dependent upon the collection of amounts recently awarded by the eastern caribbean supreme court 
in october  the british virgin islands government notified oc bvi that it was asserting a purported right of ownership of oc bvi s desalination plant in baughers bay  tortola pursuant to the terms of a agreement 
early in  the british virgin islands government unilaterally took the position that until such time as a new agreement is reached on the ownership of the baughers bay plant and for the price of the water produced by the plant  the bvi government would only pay that amount of oc bvi s invoices that the bvi government purported constituted oc bvi s costs of producing the water 
payments made by the bvi government to oc bvi since the bvi government s assumption of this reduced price were sporadic 
on november   oc bvi s management was informed that the bvi government had filed a lawsuit with the eastern caribbean supreme court the court seeking ownership and possession of the baughers bay plant 
oc bvi counterclaimed that it was entitled to continued possession and operation of the baughers bay plant until the bvi government paid oc bvi approximately million  which it believed represented the value of the baughers bay plant at its present expanded production capacity 
oc bvi also took the legal position that since the bvi government never paid the million required under the agreement to purchase the baughers bay plant  the agreement terminated on may   which was eight months after the date that the ministry provided written notice of its intention to purchase the plant 
on july   oc bvi filed a claim with the court  and on april  amended and increased this claim  seeking recovery of amounts for water sold and delivered to the bvi government from the baughers bay plant through may  based upon the contract prices in effect before the bvi government asserted its purported right of ownership of the plant 
the court held a trial in july to address both the baughers bay ownership issue and oc bvi s claim for payment of amounts owed for water sold and delivered to the bvi government and on september   the court issued a preliminary ruling with respect to this litigation 
the court determined that the bvi government was entitled to immediate possession of the baughers bay plant and dismissed oc bvi s claim for compensation of approximately million for improvements to the plant 
however  the court determined that oc bvi was entitled to full payment of water invoices issued up to december   which had been calculated under the terms of the original water supply agreement  and ordered the bvi government to make an immediate interim payment of million to oc bvi for amounts owed to oc bvi 
the court deferred deciding the entire dispute between the parties until it could conduct a hearing to determine the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period subsequent to december after conducting hearings in october  the court ordered the bvi government to pay oc bvi at the rate of per thousand imperial gallons for water produced by oc bvi for the period subsequent to december   which amounted to a total recovery for oc bvi of million as of september  the bvi government made a payment of million to oc bvi under the court order during the fourth quarter of  a second payment of million under the court order in july and a third payment of million under the court order in february on october   oc bvi filed an appeal with the eastern caribbean court of appeals the appellate court asking the appellate court to review the september  ruling by the eastern caribbean supreme court as it relates to oc bvi s claim for compensation for improvements to the baughers bay plant 
on october   the bvi government filed an appeal with the appellate court seeking the appellate court s review of the september  ruling of the court that the bvi government pay oc bvi the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period subsequent to december  the bvi government is requesting a ruling from the appellate court that the bvi government should only pay oc bvi the actual cost of water produced at the plant 
in march  the bvi government filed an application with the appellate court for a stay of execution of the judgments of the court in order to defer any further payments of amounts under the court order until such time as the appellate court rules on the appeal 
on september   the appellate court conducted its hearing of the arguments of both parties under their respective appeals 
while we anticipated that the appellate court would issue its ruling on these appeals by the end of  no ruling has been issued to date 
we have not been informed when to expect the appellate court to issue its ruling 
after considering the impact of the september and october rulings of the court of the caribbean relating to the baughers bay dispute and the announcement by the bvi government in february that it had signed a long term contract with another company for the construction and operation of a new water plant to serve tortola  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi and therefore recognized impairment losses aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  to reduce our investment in oc bvi to its estimated fair value 
the remaining carrying value of our investment in oc bvi of million as of december  assumes oc bvi will collect in full the remaining million awarded by the court and will not be required to return any of the million paid to date by the bvi government under the court order 
should the bvi government be successful in its appeal to reduce the million award  we will be required to record charges that will reduce our earnings by an amount equal to approximately of any reduction of the million previously awarded by the court 
such charges could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the staff of the sec is presently reviewing our goodwill impairment testing for  and we could ultimately be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of this asset 
the market price of our common stock has declined over the past twelve months and at times during this period  our market capitalization has been less than the carrying value of our stockholders equity 
the staff of the division of corporation finance of the us securities and exchange commission the staff has inquired through comment letters issued in connection with their periodic reviews of our recent annual and quarterly filings as to what consideration we have given to recognizing an impairment of our goodwill in light of the extent  and the duration of time  our market capitalization has been below the carrying value of our stockholders equity 
we have responded to the staff that  based upon our impairment testing for  we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  at their request  we have provided the staff with the supporting calculations  assumptions and methodologies utilized for our goodwill impairment testing 
the staff is presently reviewing this information 
our goodwill amounted to  as of december  while we have concluded that this goodwill was not impaired as of december   the staff could disagree with our conclusion and we could ultimately be required to record an impairment charge for a portion or all of this goodwill as of december  or as of a later date 
such impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  or the results of operations for future periods 
we rely on fixed term water supply agreements with our bulk customers in the cayman islands  belize and the bahamas  which may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
all of our bulk water supply agreements are for fixed terms ranging originally from seven to years and with a range of approximately one to years remaining 
upon expiration  these agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed on terms less favorable to us 
in addition  certain of these agreements for plants not owned by us provide for our customers to take over the operations of the plant upon expiration of the contract term 
if this occurs  we may no longer generate income from such plant 
in instances where we own the plant that produces the water under an agreement that is not renewed or renewed with lower production quantities  we may not be able to find a new customer for the plant s excess production capacity 
if our fixed term agreements are not renewed or are renewed on terms less favorable to us  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have spent almost million to fund the developmental costs for a possible project in mexico  and may elect to expend significant additional funds to pursue this project 
however  we could decide after expending these additional funds that the project is not viable 
in may  we acquired  through our wholly owned netherlands subsidiary  consolidated water cooperatief  ua  a interest in nsc agua  nsc de nsc  nsc a mexican company 
nsc has been formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction  ownership and operation of a million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern baja california  mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to a mexican potable water system and the us border 
we believe such a project can be successful due to what we anticipate will be a growing need for a new potable water supply for the areas of northern baja california  mexico and southern california  united states 
to complete this project  we have engaged an engineering group with extensive regional experience and have partnered with doosan heavy industries and construction  a global leader in the engineering  procurement and construction of large seawater desalination plants 
once completed  we would operate the plant while retaining a minority position in its ownership 
nsc is in the development stage  and is presently involved in i extending contracts for the purchase of land on which to build the plant  ii seeking contracts for the electric power and feed water sources for the plant s proposed operations  and iii implementing a water quality monitoring and equipment testing program at the proposed feed water source 
in addition to completing these activities  nsc will be required to complete various other steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including  but not limited to  obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in mexico and the united states  securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable  and obtaining equity and debt financing for the project 
nsc s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from nsc 
for our interest in nsc  we agreed to provide initial funding of up to million in the form of equity for nsc s development activities 
as of june  we had met this initial funding commitment 
because we exercise effective financial control over nsc and our partners in nsc did not participate in funding the first million in losses that nsc incurred  we consolidate nsc s results of operations 
included in our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and are approximately and million respectively in general and administrative expenses from nsc  consisting of organizational  legal  accounting  engineering  consulting and other costs relating to its project development activities 
the assets and liabilities of nsc included in our consolidated balance sheet amounted to approximately  and  respectively  as of december  and approximately  and  respectively  as of december  in february  we acquired an option  exercisable through february   to purchase the shares of one of the other shareholders of nsc along with an immediate power of attorney to vote those shares 
as a result  we now have effective control over nsc and are continuing its project development activities 
we have determined that completing nsc s development activities will require significantly more funding than has been expended to date 
we may choose to fund these development activities ourselves or may seek funding from additional investors 
we may incur significant development expenses in the future for this project without ultimately being able to obtain the funding necessary for nsc to build the project 
we estimate that it will take at least two years for nsc to complete all of the development activities which include initiating site piloting plant activities  extending purchase agreements for the land for the plant  securing feed water and power supplies  completing the engineering and feasibility studies  negotiating customer contracts  obtaining required regulatory permits and arranging the project financing necessary to commence construction of the plant 
however nsc may ultimately be unable to complete all of the activities necessary to begin construction of the project 
we do not have voting control over our affiliate  oc bvi 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of oc bvi s other voting shareholder could adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi 
we own of the equity and of the voting shares of oc bvi 
we and sage  which owns the remaining of the voting shares  are each entitled to appoint three of the six directors of oc bvi 
if a tie vote of the directors occurs on any matter  the president of the caribbean water and wastewater association  a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives  is entitled to appoint a temporary director to cast the deciding vote 
as a result  although we provide operating management and engineering services to oc bvi  we share the overall management of oc bvi with sage and do not fully control its operations 
a divergence of our interests and the interests of sage could adversely affect the operations of oc bvi and in turn decrease the value of our investment in oc bvi  in which case we could be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such an impairment charge would reduce our earnings and have a significant adverse impact on our result of operations and financial condition 
the profitability of our plants is dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs of their construction and operation 
the cost estimates prepared in connection with the construction and operation of our plants are subject to inherent uncertainties 
additionally  the terms of our supply contracts may require us to guarantee the price of water on a per unit basis  subject to certain annual inflation and monthly energy cost adjustments  and to assume the risk that the costs associated with producing this water may be greater than anticipated 
because we base our contracted price of water in part on our estimation of future construction and operating costs  the profitability of our plants is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost of materials and services and the cost of the delivery of such services may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant  which could cause the gross profit and net return on investment for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the profit margins we initially expect to generate from a plant could be further reduced if future operating costs for that plant exceed our estimates of such costs 
these future operating costs could be affected by a variety of factors  including lower than anticipated production efficiencies and hydrological conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those that existed at the time we submitted our bid 
any construction and operating costs for our plants that significantly exceed our initial estimates could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
a significant portion of our consolidated revenues are derived from two customers 
a loss of  or a less favorable relationship with  either of these customers would adversely affect us 
our top two bulk water customers  the water authority cayman and the wsc  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if either of these customers terminate or decide not to renew their contracts with us  or renew such contracts on terms that are less favorable to us  or become unable for financial or other reasons to comply with the terms of our contracts with them  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition would be adversely affected 
possible future regulatory oversight and control could adversely impact our belize operations 
by statutory instrument no 
of  the minister of public utilities of the government of belize published an order  the public utility provider class declaration order  the order  which as of may  designated cw belize as public utility provider under the laws of belize 
with this designation  the public utilities commission of belize the puc has the authority to set the rates charged by cw belize and to otherwise regulate its activities 
on november   cw belize received a formal complaint from the puc alleging that cw belize was operating without a license under the terms of the water industry act 
cw belize applied for this license in december on july   the puc issued the san pedro public water supply quality and security complaint order the second order which among other things requires that i cw belize and its customer jointly make a submission to the responsible minister requesting that the area surrounding cw belize s seawater abstraction wells be designated a forest reserve or national park and be designated a controlled area under section of the water industry act  ii cw belize submit an operations manual for cw belize s desalination plant to the puc for approval  iii cw belize and its customer modify the water supply agreement between the parties to a include new water quality parameters included in the order and b cap the current exclusive water supply arrangement in the agreement at maximum of  gallons per day  iv cw belize keeps a minimum number of replacement seawater reverse osmosis membranes in stock at all times and v cw belize takes possession of and reimburses the puc for certain equipment which the puc purchased from a third party in late cw belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the second order by the puc until such time as the matter can be heard by the belize courts 
we are presently unable to determine what impact the order and the second order will have on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our operations are affected by tourism and are subject to seasonal fluctuations which could affect the demand for our water 
our operations are affected by the levels of tourism and are subject to seasonal variations in our service areas 
demand for our water in the cayman islands  belize  bimini and the bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather  primarily rainfall 
tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists home countries  primarily the united states and europe  terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof  and increased costs of fuel and airfares 
we normally sell more water during the first and second quarters  when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less  than in the third and fourth quarters 
a downturn in tourism or greater than expected rainfall in the locations we serve could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
we may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current operating areas 
our expansion both within our current operating areas and into new areas involves significant risks  including  but not limited to  the following regulatory risks  including government relations difficulties  local regulations  currency controls and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  receiving and maintaining necessary permits  licenses and approvals  risks related to operating in foreign countries  including political instability  reliance on local economies  environmental problems  shortages of materials  immigration restrictions and limited skilled labor  risks related to development of new operations  including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water  engineering difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled  and risks relating to greater competition in these new territories  including the ability of our competitors to gain or retain market share by reducing prices 
even if we successfully expand our operations  we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we cannot assure you that any new operations within or outside of our current operating areas will attain or maintain profitability or that the results from these new operations will not negatively affect our overall profitability 
production shortfalls under any of our bulk supply contracts could result in penalties or cancellation of the contract 
our bulk water supply contracts require us to deliver specified minimum volumes of water 
during a period from october to february  we were unable to deliver the minimum water volumes required under one of our bulk water supply contracts because of mechanical equipment problems and membrane fouling 
we have since resolved the minimum supply issues for this plant 
however  membrane fouling or other technical problems could occur at any of our plants  and if we are unable to meet the production minimums due to such operating issues  we could be in technical default of the supply contract and subject to various adverse consequences  including financial penalties or cancellation of the contract 
our operations could be harmed by hurricanes or tropical storms 
a hurricane or tropical storm could cause major damage to our equipment and properties and the properties of our customers  including the large tourist properties in our areas of operation 
for example  in september hurricane ivan caused significant damage to our plants and our customers properties  which adversely affected our revenues 
any future damage could cause us to lose use of our equipment and properties and incur additional repair costs 
damage to our customers properties and the adverse impact on tourism could result in a decrease in water demand 
a hurricane or tropical storm could also disrupt the delivery of equipment and supplies  including electricity  necessary to our operations 
these and other possible effects of hurricanes or tropical storms could have an adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
contamination of our processed water may cause disruption in our services and adversely affect our revenues 
our processed water may become contaminated by natural occurrences and by inadvertent or intentional human interference  including acts of terrorism 
in the event that a portion of our processed water is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the supply of water until we are able to install treatment equipment or substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water production source 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in order to treat a contaminated source of plant feed water through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
an inability by us to substitute processed water from an uncontaminated water source or to adequately treat the contaminated plant feed water in a cost effective manner may have an adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
potential government decisions  actions and regulations could negatively affect our operations 
we are subject to the local regulations of the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands  and the bahamas  all of which are subject to change 
any government that regulates our operations may issue legislation or adopt new regulations  including but not limited to restricting foreign ownership of us  providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government  providing for nationalization of public utilities by the government  providing for different water quality standards  unilaterally changing or renegotiating our licenses and agreements  restricting the transfer of us currency  or causing currency exchange fluctuations devaluations or making changes in tax laws 
as new laws and regulations are issued  we may be required to modify our operations and business strategy  which we may be unable to do in a cost effective manner 
failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate  the assessment of penalties or fines  or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the rates we charge our retail customers in the cayman islands are subject to regulation 
if we are unable to obtain government approval of our requests for rate increases  or if approved rate increases are untimely or inadequate to cover our projected expenses  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
under our exclusive retail license in the cayman islands  with the exception of annual inflation related and monthly energy related adjustments  we cannot increase the base rates we charge our retail customers without prior approval from the cayman islands government 
however  the expenses we incur in supplying water under this license may increase due to circumstances that were unforeseen at the time we entered into the license 
we may incur additional costs in attempting to obtain government approval of any rate increase  which may be granted on a delayed basis  if at all 
failure to obtain timely and adequate rate increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we rely on the efforts of key employees 
our failure to retain these employees could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends upon the abilities of our executive officers 
in particular  the loss of the services of fredrick w 
mctaggart  our president and chief executive officer  could be detrimental to our operations and our continued success 
mr 
mctaggart has an employment agreement expiring on december  each year  the term of this agreement may be extended for an additional year 
however  we cannot guarantee that mr 
mctaggart will continue to work for us during the term of his agreement or will enter into any extensions thereof 
we are exposed to credit risk through our relationships with several customers 
we are subject to credit risk posed by possible defaults in payment by our bulk water customers in the cayman islands  belize  the british virgin islands and the bahamas and by possible defaults in payment of loan receivables by the water authority cayman 
adverse economic conditions affecting  or financial difficulties of  those parties could impair their ability to pay us or cause them to delay payment 
we depend on these parties to pay us on a timely basis 
our outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
any delay or default in payment could adversely affect our cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
we are exposed to the risk of variations in currency exchange rates 
although we report our results in united states dollars  the majority of our revenues are earned in other currencies 
all of the currencies in our operating areas other than the mexican peso and the euro have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years and we do not employ a hedging strategy against exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may enter new markets in the future in which we do not have a contractual commitment for our products or existing customers 
our strategy contemplates potential entry into new markets  such as mexico and asia  where we believe a demand for potable water exists beyond the current supply of potable water in those markets 
we may incur significant business development expenses in the pursuit of new markets prior to obtaining a contract for services in these markets  and such expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we may decide to enter such markets by building new reverse osmosis desalination plants before we have obtained a contract for the sale of water produced by the new plant or before we have established a customer base for the water produced by the new plant 
if after completing such plant we are unable to obtain a contract or sufficient number of customers for the plant  we may be unable to recover the cost of our investment in the plant  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not pay dividends in the future 
if dividends are paid  they may be in lesser amounts than past dividends 
our shareholders may receive dividends out of legally available funds if  and when  they are declared by our board of directors 
we have paid dividends in the past  but may cease to do so at any time 
we may incur increased capital requirements or additional indebtedness in the future that may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends 
we may also be restricted from paying dividends in the future due to restrictions imposed by applicable corporate laws  our financial condition and results of operations  covenants contained in our financing agreements  management s assessment of future capital needs and other factors considered by our board of directors 
we may not continue to pay dividends in the future or  if dividends are paid  they may not be in amounts similar to past dividends 
service of process and enforcement of legal proceedings commenced against us in the united states may be difficult to obtain 
we are incorporated under the laws of the cayman islands and most of our assets are located outside of the united states 
in addition  of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult for investors to affect service of process within the united states upon us and such other persons  or to enforce judgments obtained against such persons in united states courts  and bring any action  including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the united states securities laws 
in addition  it may be difficult for investors to enforce  in original actions brought in courts or jurisdictions located outside of the united states  rights predicated upon the united states securities laws 
based on the advice of our cayman islands legal counsel  we believe there is no reciprocal statutory enforcement of foreign judgments between the united states and the cayman islands  and that foreign judgments originating from the united states are not directly enforceable in the cayman islands 
a prevailing party in a united states proceeding against us or our officers or directors would have to initiate a new proceeding in the cayman islands using the united states judgment as evidence of the party s claim 
a prevailing party could rely on the summary judgment procedures available in the cayman islands  subject to available defenses in the cayman islands courts  including  but not limited to  the lack of competent jurisdiction in the united states courts  lack of due service of process in the united states proceeding and the possibility that enforcement or recognition of the united states judgment would be contrary to the public policy of the cayman islands 
depending on the nature of damages awarded  civil liabilities under the securities act of  as amended or the securities act  or the securities exchange act of  as amended or the exchange act  for original actions instituted outside the cayman islands may or may not be enforceable 
for example  a united states judgment awarding remedies unobtainable in any legal action in the courts of the cayman islands  such as treble damages  would likely not be enforceable under any circumstances 
low trading volume of our stock may limit your ability to sell your shares at or above the price you pay for them 
during the year ended december   the average daily trading volume of our common shares was approximately  shares  a much lower trading volume than the stock of many other companies listed on the nasdaq global select market 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
as a consequence of the limited volume of trading in our common shares  an investor in our stock may have difficulty selling a large number of our common shares in the manner or at the price that might be attainable if our common shares were more actively traded 
in addition  as a result of our low trading volume  the market price of our common shares may not accurately reflect their value 
we are subject to anti takeover measures that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
classified board of directors 
we have a classified board that consists of three groups of directors 
only one group of directors is elected each year 
our classified board may increase the length of time necessary for an acquirer to change the composition of a majority of directors in order to gain control of our board 
option deed 
our board of directors has adopted an option deed that is intended to improve the bargaining position of our board of directors in the event of an unsolicited offer to acquire our outstanding stock 
under the terms of the option deed  a stock purchase right is attached to each of our current or future outstanding common shares issued prior to the time the purchase rights become exercisable  are redeemed or expire 
the purchase rights will become exercisable only if an individual or group has acquired  or obtained the right to acquire  or announced a tender or exchange offer that if consummated would result in such individual or group acquiring beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common shares 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the rights will entitle every holder of our common shares  other than the acquirer  to purchase our shares or shares of our successor on terms that would likely be economically dilutive to the acquirer 
under certain circumstances  instead of common shares  our board of directors may issue cash or debt securities 
our board of directors  however  has the power to amend the option deed so that it does not apply to a particular acquisition proposal or to redeem the rights for a nominal value before they become exercisable 
these features will likely encourage an acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors before commencing a tender offer or to condition a tender offer on our board of directors taking action to prevent the purchase rights from becoming exercisable 
in march  our board extended the expiration date of the option deed through july as a result of these anti takeover measures  we could deter efforts to make changes to  or exercise control over  current management 
in addition  our shareholders may not have an opportunity to sell their common shares to a potential acquirer at the acquirer s offering price  which is typically at a premium to market price 
restrictive covenants in our credit facilities and trust deeds could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility  our failure to comply with these covenants could cause foreclosure on our assets 
our credit facilities and the trust deeds governing the terms of our debt securities contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants and requirements limit our ability  without approval of the lender or trustee  to take various actions  including incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures  guaranteeing indebtedness  engaging in various types of transactions  including mergers and sales of assets  and paying dividends and making distributions or other restricted payments 
these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may not be required to operate under these or similar restrictions 
further  these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  acquisition or investment opportunities 
a material breach of any of these covenants would constitute a default under our credit facilities or trust deeds 
in the event of default  the lender or trustee may accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness 
if we are unable to repay the amounts accelerated  the lender or trustee has the right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets  which we have pledged to secure that indebtedness 
foreclosure upon our assets would have a significant adverse affect on our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and ability to continue operations 
item b 
unresolved staff comments the market price of our common stock has declined over the past twelve months and at times during this period  our market capitalization has been less than the carrying value of our stockholders equity 
the staff of the division of corporation finance of the us securities and exchange commission the staff has inquired through comment letters issued in connection with their periodic reviews of our recent annual and quarterly filings as to what consideration we have given to recognizing an impairment of our goodwill in light of the extent  and the duration of time  our market capitalization has been below the carrying value of our stockholders equity 
we have responded to the staff that  based upon our impairment testing for  we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  at their request  we have provided the staff with the supporting calculations  assumptions and methodologies utilized for our goodwill impairment testing 
the staff is presently reviewing this information 
our goodwill amounted to  as of december  while we have concluded that this goodwill was not impaired as of december   the staff could disagree with our conclusion and we could ultimately be required to record an impairment charge for a portion or all of this goodwill as of december  or as of a later date 
such impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  or the results of operations for future periods

we intend to increase revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas and in new areas 
we expect to maintain operating efficiencies by continuing to focus on our successful business model and by properly executing our equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs 
we believe that many water scarce countries in the caribbean basin  and other select markets present opportunities for our business model 
our operations and activities  and those of our affiliate oc bvi  are presently conducted at plants in four countries the cayman islands  the bahamas  the british virgin islands and belize 
the following table sets forth the comparative combined production capacity of our retail  bulk and affiliate operations as of december of each year 
comparative operations location plants capacity location plants capacity cayman islands cayman islands bahamas bahamas belize belize british virgin islands british virgin islands bermuda bermuda in millions of us gallons per day 
cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using ro technology to convert seawater to potable water since the cayman islands have a limited natural supply of fresh water 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
our operations consist of eight reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants which provide water to approximately  retail residential and commercial customers within a government licensed area and bulk water sales to the water authority cayman 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride and high density polyethylene pipe 
our exclusive license from the cayman islands government was set to expire on july   however we and the cayman islands government have agreed in correspondence to extend the license seven times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license 
we were advised by letter dated february  from water authority cayman that the government had approved an extension of the license until june  we are currently waiting for the government to execute such license extension 
on february   the cayman islands government enacted new water regulation laws pursuant to which the water authority cayman cayman will issue any new retail license 
we have been informed during our retail license negotiations that the cayman islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license to employ a rate of return on invested capital model  the implementation of which could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license

bahamas cw bahamas produces potable water from three reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants 
two of these plants  the windsor plant and the blue hills plant  are located in new providence and have a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
cw bahamas supplies water from these plants on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas the wsc under long term build  own and operate supply agreements 
during  we supplied approximately billion us gallons billion us gallons of water to the wsc from these plants 
cw bahamas third plant is located in bimini  has a capacity of  us gallons per day  and provides potable water to the bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
we have also sold water intermittently to the wsc from our bimini plant when their regular supply was unavailable 
from time to time  cw bahamas has experienced delays in collecting its accounts receivable due to financial difficulties experienced by the wsc 
cw bahamas was due approximately million and million from the wsc as of december  and january   respectively 
representatives of the bahamas government have informed us that the delay in paying our accounts receivables is due to operating issues within the wsc  that the delay does not reflect any type of dispute with us with respect to the amounts owed  and that the amounts will ultimately be paid in full 
we believe that the accounts receivable from the wsc are fully collectible and therefore have not provided any allowance for possible non payment of these receivables as of december  belize cw belize was acquired on july   and consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant on ambergris caye  belize  central america capable of producing  us gallons per day 
we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
in  the minister of public utilities of the government of belize published a declaratory order designating cw belize as a public utility provider 
with this order the public utilities commission of belize puc has the authority to regulate cw belize s activities 
in in the puc issued a second order that requires cw belize to take various actions mandated by the puc that would be significant to its operations 
cw belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the second order by the puc until such time as the matter can be heard by the courts

british virgin islands we hold an equity position in  and shared management of  oc bvi 
this affiliate produces potable water from two reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants located at bar bay  tortola and the island of jost van dyke 
the plants at bar bay and jost van dyke have a total installed capacity of  and  us gallons per day  respectively  and provide water to the department of water and sewerage of the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands 
during the three years ended december   oc bvi also sold water to the department of water and sewerage from a plant with a million us gallon per day capacity located at baughers bay  tortola 
in  the bvi government initiated litigation against oc bvi over ownership of the baughers bay plant 
on march   as the result of a court decision granting the bvi government ownership of this plant  oc bvi vacated the baughers bay plant and the bvi government assumed direct responsibility for its operations 
oc bvi remains involved in litigation with the bvi government over the final amounts due oc bvi for water supplied from the baughers bay plant 
the final resolution of this litigation  which is currently under appeal  could significantly impact the value of our investment in oc bvi

risk factors 
bermuda in january  our affiliate  consolidated water bermuda limited cw bermuda entered into a design  build  sale and operating agreement with the government of bermuda for a desalination plant to be built in two phases at tynes bay along the northern coast of bermuda 
under the agreement  cw bermuda constructed and operated the plant from the second quarter of through the termination of the agreement on june  we entered into a management services agreement with cw bermuda for the design  construction and operation of the tynes bay plant  under which we received fees for direct services  purchasing activities and proprietary technology 
although we own only of the common shares of cw bermuda  we consolidate its results in our consolidated financial statements as we are its primary financial beneficiary 
as a result of the termination of its agreement with the bermuda government  we do not expect to receive any future fees or revenues from cw bermuda 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ significantly from such estimates and assumptions 
certain of our accounting estimates or assumptions constitute critical accounting estimates for us due to the fact that the nature of these estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition and results of operations is material 
our critical accounting estimates relate to i the valuation of our equity investment in our affiliate  oc bvi  ii goodwill and intangible assets  and iii plant construction revenues and costs 
valuation of equity investment in oc bvi 
we account for our investment in oc bvi under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this method requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary  and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment 
the final resolution of oc bvi s on going dispute and litigation with the bvi government relating to the baughers bay plant may result in a fair value of our investment in oc bvi that is less than our carrying value for this investment 
as a quoted market price for oc bvi s stock is not available  to test for possible impairment of our investment in oc bvi we estimate its fair value by calculating the expected cash flows from our investment in oc bvi by i estimating the expected cash flows from oc bvi s contract with the bvi government to supply water from its bar bay plant  i identifying various possible outcomes of the baughers bay litigation and estimating the cash flows associated with each possible outcome  and iii assigning a probability to each baughers bay outcome and associated expected cash flows based upon discussions held to date by oc bvi s management with the bvi government and oc bvi s legal counsel 
the resulting probability weighted sum represents the expected cash flows  and our best estimate of future cash flows  to be derived from our investment in oc bvi  which are present valued to estimate oc bvi s fair value 
the identification of the possible outcomes for the baughers bay dispute  the projections of cash flows for each outcome  and the assignment of relative probabilities to each outcome all represent significant estimates made by us 
while we have used our best judgment to identify the possible outcomes and expected cash flows for these outcomes and assign relative probabilities to each outcome  these estimates are by their nature highly subjective and are also subject to material change by our management over time based upon additional information from oc bvi s management and legal counsel  and a change in the status of oc bvi s litigation with the bvi government 
after considering the september and october rulings of the eastern caribbean supreme court relating to the baughers bay litigation and an announcement by the bvi government in february that it had signed a contract with another company to construct and operate a plant to provide potable water to the greater tortola area served by the baughers bay plant  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi and therefore recognized impairment losses aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  the remaining carrying value of our investment in oc bvi as of december  of million assumes that the bvi government will ultimately pay oc bvi the full amount awarded by the eastern caribbean supreme court in its rulings 
to date  the bvi government has paid only million of the million awarded by this court 
the bvi government has appealed these rulings  and the eastern caribbean court of appeals could ultimately overturn the rulings of the eastern caribbean supreme court or require the bvi government to pay oc bvi an amount lower than the amount awarded by the eastern caribbean supreme court 
should the bvi government be successful in its appeal to reduce the million court award  we will be required to record charges that will reduce our earnings by an amount approximately equal to of any reduction of the million previously awarded by the court 
if the bvi government is successful in its appeal  or if the bvi government fails to honor the terms of the contract for the bar bay plant  the actual cash flows from oc bvi could vary materially from the expected cash flows we used in determining oc bvi s fair value as of december   and we would be required to record an additional loss to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed periodically for impairment 
we evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill annually as part of our reporting process for the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
management identifies our reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit by calculating the expected cash flows from each reporting unit and compare the fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
for each of the years in the three year period ended december  we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units by applying the discounted cash flow method  the subject company stock price method  the guideline public company method  and the mergers and acquisitions method 
the discounted cash flow method relied upon seven year discrete projections of operating results  working capital and capital expenditures  along with a terminal value subsequent to the discrete period 
these seven year projections were based upon historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  and considered the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the discount rates for the calculations represented the estimated cost of capital for market participants at the time of each analysis 
we did not adjust our projections for any possible impact of negotiations underway with the cayman islands government for the renewal of our exclusive retail license 
we also estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units for each of the years in the three year period ended december  through reference to the quoted market prices for our company and guideline companies and the market multiples implied by guideline merger and acquisition transactions 
we also performed an analysis reconciling the conclusions of value for our reporting units to our market capitalization at october  based upon our discounted cash flows and market price analyses  no impairment charges were required for our goodwill for any of the years in the three year period ended december  plant construction revenue and cost of plant construction revenue 
we recognize revenue and related costs as work progresses on fixed price contracts for the construction of desalination plants to be sold to third parties using the percentage of completion method  which relies on contract revenue and estimates of total expected costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
under the percentage of completion method  we record revenue and recognize profit or loss as work on the contract progresses 
our engineering personnel estimate total project costs and profit to be earned on each long term  fixed price contract prior to commencement of work on the contract and update these estimates as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date comprise of estimated total contract costs 
as work progresses  if the actual contract costs exceed estimates  the profit recognized on revenue from that contract decreases 
we recognize the full amount of any estimated loss on a contract at the time the estimates indicate such a loss 
to date we have not experienced a material adverse variation from our cost estimates for plants constructed for sale to third parties 
we assume the risk that the costs associated with constructing the plant may be greater than we anticipated in preparing our bid 
however  the terms of each of the sales contracts with our customers require us to guarantee the sales price for the plant at the bid amount 
because we base our contracted sales price in part on our estimation of future construction costs  the profitability of our plant sales is dependent on our ability to estimate these costs accurately 
the cost estimates we prepare in connection with the construction of plants to be sold to third parties are subject to inherent uncertainties 
the cost of materials and construction may increase significantly after we submit our bid for a plant due to factors beyond our control  which could cause the gross margin for a plant to be less than we anticipated when the bid was made 
the gross profit we initially expect to generate from a plant sale could be further affected by other factors  such as hydro geologic conditions at the plant site that differ materially from those we believed existed and relied upon when we submitted our bid

results by segment retail segment the retail segment contributed  and  to our income from operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues generated by our retail water operations were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the number of gallons sold by the retail segment decreased by approximately from to due to water sales made in the first quarter of at bulk water rates to the water authority cayman wac to replace water previously supplied by the red gate plant while such plant was under refurbishment 
excluding this water sold to the wac  the number of gallons sold by the retail segment increased by approximately from to the increase in retail revenues from to is due to i the annual first quarter adjustment to our base rates  as our retail segment increased its base rates by approximately due to an upward movement in the consumer price indices used to determine such rate adjustment  and ii higher energy prices in which resulted in energy pass through charges to our retail customers that were approximately  higher in than in retail segment gross profit was  of revenues and  of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues from to reflects the increased energy pass through charges and higher non revenue water volumes for consistent with prior periods  we record all non direct g a expenses in our retail business segment and do not allocate any of these non direct costs to our other two business segments

bulk segment the bulk segment contributed  and  to our income from operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
bulk segment revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in bulk revenues of approximately million from to resulted from a increase in the number of gallons of water sold and energy pass through increases to our rates due to higher energy prices 
our bulk revenues for benefited from  in revenues generated in the fourth quarter from the expansion of cw bahamas blue hills plant 
gross profit for our bulk segment was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of bulk revenues increased to approximately for as compared to approximately for the improvement in the bulk segment s gross profit as a percentage of revenues in from is attributable to the increase in revenues  as a significant portion of our production costs are relatively fixed in nature and do not increase proportionately with an increase in the volume of water sold 
bulk segment g a expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in these expenses from to is primarily due to approximately  in additional taxes paid by our belize operations during the first quarter of services segment the services segment incurred losses from operations of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that the services segment will continue to incur losses from operations while we continue to fund the project development activities of nsc and or until such time as we obtain significant new management services or plant construction contracts 
services segment revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
services revenues decreased from to due to i substantially lower plant sales revenues  which declined by approximately million due to a lack of customer plant construction activity in  ii the expiration of the management services contract for the bermuda plant on june   and iii lower fees earned on our management agreement for oc bvi due to the incremental fees earned on the higher earnings generated by this affiliate in as compared to gross profit for our services segment was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively

results by segment retail segment the retail segment contributed  to our income from operations in  as compared to  in revenues generated by our retail water operations were  and  for and  respectively 
the volume of gallons sold in by the retail segment decreased by approximately from to the decline in retail revenues from to is principally attributable to the annual inflation related adjustment made to our base rates made during the first quarter of each year 
this adjustment decreased our rates in due to a downward movement in the consumer price indices from to used to determine such adjustment 
retail segment gross profit was  of revenues and  of revenues for and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues from to reflects the base rate adjustment discussed in the previous paragraph 
as of the date of this filing we have not concluded negotiations with the cayman islands government for an extension of our retail license 
the outcome of these negotiations could have a material impact on the amounts of revenues and gross profit we have historically generated from our retail segment

the volume of water sold by our bulk segment decreased by approximately from to gross profit for our bulk segment was  and  for and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of bulk revenues was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in bulk gross profit from to reflects the annual inflation related adjustment made during the first quarter of to the base rates charged by ocean conversion cayman 
this adjustment reduced occ s rates in due to a downward movement in the consumer price indices used to determine such adjustment 
the bulk segment s gross profit was also affected by the loss of the relatively higher margins earned on the previous contract the extension for which expired in late for the red gate plant  coupled with the delay in completing the refurbishment of this plant 
bulk segment g a expenses were  and  for and  respectively 
the decrease in this segment s g a expenses from to is primarily due to approximately  in penalties and interest assessed to our belize operations in relating to delinquent business taxes and a decrease in bank charges of approximately  for our bahamas operations 
the belize penalties and interest arose because we were erroneously informed in the past that our belize subsidiary was not subject to these taxes 
the bank charges incurred in resulted from the conversion of bahamas dollars into us dollars and the transfer of such dollars from the bahamas to grand cayman 
services segment the services segment incurred a loss from operations of  for the year ended december  the services segment contributed  to our income from operations for the year ended december services segment revenues were  and  for and  respectively 
services revenues decreased from to due to substantially lower plant sales revenues  which declined by approximately million due to reduced construction activity for third parties  and to a decrease of approximately  in management fees due to the renegotiation of the management services agreement for the bermuda plant 
gross profit for our services segment was  and  for and  respectively 
the lower gross profit for stems primarily from the decreased plant sales revenues and  to a lesser extent  from liquidated damages of  and construction cost overruns relating to the refurbishment and commissioning of the red gate plant 
g a expenses for the services segment were  and  for and  respectively

if we are not in default of any terms of the license  we have a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government offers to any third party 
this license was set to expire on july   however  we and the cayman islands government have agreed in correspondence to extend the license seven times in order to provide sufficient time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement 
the government has not requested that we meet to continue our retail license negotiations since our last meeting in february we believe the lack of recent license negotiations results from government s focus on other matters including the government s publicly acknowledged intention to privatize certain government owned assets including the water authority cayman rather than any inability to make progress with us on the license negotiations 
we were advised by a letter dated february  from water authority cayman that the government had approved an extension of the license until june  we are currently waiting for the government to execute such license extension and continue to believe that the retail license negotiations will ultimately be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties 
on february   the water production and supply law  which replaces the water production and supply law revision under which the company is licensed and the water authority amendment law  the new laws were published on terms that they would come into force on such date as may be appointed by order made by the governor in cabinet 
such order was subsequently made by cabinet and the new laws are now in full force and effect 
under the new laws  the water authority cayman would issue any new license which could include a rate of return on invested capital model described below 
we have been informed during our retail license renewal negotiations conducted with representatives of the cayman islands government that the cayman islands government seeks to restructure the terms of our license to employ a rate of return on invested capital model similar to that governing the sale of water to many us municipalities 
we have formally objected to the implementation of a rate of return on invested capital model on the basis that we believe that such a model would not promote the efficient operation of our water utility and could ultimately increase water rates to our customers 
we believe such a model  if ultimately implemented  could significantly reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the million carrying value of our retail segment s goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
if a new long term license agreement is not entered into with the government  we would retain a right of first refusal to renew the license on terms that are no less favorable than those that the government might offer in the future to a third party 
if we do not enter into a new license agreement  and no other party is awarded a license  we expect to be permitted to continue to supply water to our service area 
however  the terms of such continued supply may not be as favorable to us as the terms in the july license agreement 
it is possible that the government could offer a third party a license to service some or all of our present service area 
in such event  we may assume the license offered to the third party by exercising our right of first refusal 
the terms of the new license agreement may not be as favorable to us as the terms under which we are presently operating and could reduce the operating income and cash flows we have historically generated from our retail license and could require us to record an impairment loss to reduce the million carrying value of our retail segment s goodwill 
such impairment loss could be material to our results of operations 
oc bvi litigation in october  our affiliate oc bvi notified us that the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands the ministry had asserted a purported right of ownership of the baughers bay plant pursuant to the terms of the water supply agreement between the parties dated may the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  upon the expiration of the initial seven year term in may  the agreement would automatically be extended for another seven year term unless the ministry provided notice  at least eight months prior to such expiration  of its decision to purchase the plant from oc bvi for approximately million 
in correspondence between the parties from late through early  the ministry indicated that the bvi government intended to purchase the plant but would be amenable to negotiating a new water supply agreement  and that it considered the agreement to be in force on a monthly basis until negotiations between the bvi government and oc bvi were concluded 
occasional discussions were held between the parties since without resolution of the matter 
oc bvi continued to supply water to the ministry and expended approximately million between and to significantly expand the production capacity of the plant beyond that contemplated in the agreement 
early in  the ministry unilaterally took the position that until such time as a new agreement was reached on the ownership of the plant and the price for the water produced by the plant  the ministry would only pay that amount of oc bvi s billings that the ministry purported constituted oc bvi s costs of producing the water 
payments made by the ministry to oc bvi since the ministry s assumption of this reduced price were sporadic 
on november   oc bvi issued a demand letter to the bvi government for approximately million representing amounts that oc bvi claimed were due by the bvi government for water sold and delivered plus interest and legal fees 
in response to oc bvi s demand for payment  the bvi government issued a letter dated november  that reasserted its claim that ownership of the baughers bay plant had passed to the bvi government and rejected oc bvi s claim for payment 
on november   oc bvi s management was informed that the bvi government had filed a lawsuit with the eastern caribbean supreme court the court seeking ownership of the baughers bay plant 
oc bvi counterclaimed that it was entitled to continued possession and operation of the baughers bay plant until the bvi government paid oc bvi approximately million  which it believed represented the value of the baughers bay plant at its expanded production capacity 
oc bvi took the legal position that since the bvi government never paid the million to purchase the baughers bay plant  the agreement terminated on may   which was eight months after the date that the ministry provided written notice of its intention to purchase the plant 
on july   oc bvi filed a claim with the court  and on april  amended and increased this claim  seeking payment for water sold and delivered to the bvi government through may  at the contract prices in effect before the bvi government asserted its purported right of ownership of the plant 
the court held a three day trial in july to address both the baughers bay ownership issue and oc bvi s claim for payment of amounts owed for water sold and delivered to the bvi government and on september   the court issued a preliminary ruling with respect to this litigation 
the court determined that the bvi government was entitled to immediate possession of the baughers bay plant and dismissed oc bvi s claim for compensation of approximately million for the expenditures made to expand the production capacity of the plant 
as a result of this determination by the court  oc bvi recorded an impairment loss of approximately million during the three months ended september  for fixed assets associated with the baughers bay plant 
however  the court determined that oc bvi was entitled to full payment of water invoices issued up to december   which had been calculated under the terms of the original agreement  and ordered the bvi government to make an immediate interim payment of million to oc bvi for amounts owed to oc bvi 
the court deferred deciding the entire dispute between the parties until it could conduct a hearing to determine the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period subsequent to december  on october   the court ordered the bvi government to pay oc bvi at the rate of per thousand imperial gallons for water produced by oc bvi for the period subsequent to december   which amounted to a total recovery for oc bvi of million 
the bvi government made a payment of million to oc bvi under the court order during the fourth quarter of  a second payment of million under the court order during july and a third payment under the court order of million in february on october   oc bvi filed an appeal with the eastern caribbean court of appeals the appellate court asking the appellate court to review the september  ruling by the eastern caribbean supreme court as it relates to oc bvi s claim for compensation for expenditures made to expand the production capacity of the baughers bay plant 
on october   the bvi government filed an appeal with the appellate court seeking the appellate court s review of the september  ruling of the court that the bvi government pay oc bvi the reasonable rate for water produced by oc bvi for the period subsequent to december  the bvi government is requesting a ruling from the appellate court that the bvi government should only pay oc bvi the actual cost of water produced at the plant 
in march  the bvi government filed an application with the appellate court for a stay of execution of the judgments of the court in order to defer any further payments of amounts under the court order until such time as the appellate court rules on the appeal 
on september   the appellate court conducted its hearing of the arguments of both parties under their respective appeals 
while we anticipated that the appellate court would issue its ruling on these appeals by the end of  no ruling has been issued to date 
we have not been informed when to expect the appellate court to issue its ruling 
under us gaap revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
effective january   oc bvi changed its policy for the recording of its revenues from the baughers bay plant from the accrual to the equivalent of the cash method due to an inability to meet all of the above revenue recognition criteria 
as a result of this adjustment to oc bvi s revenues  the company recorded losses from its equity in oc bvi s results of operations for all fiscal quarters of and for the first three quarters of any cash payments made by the bvi government on baughers bay related invoices were applied by oc bvi to the remaining balance of outstanding accounts receivable that arose from billings for periods prior to and including december and thus were not recognized as revenues 
sufficient payments had been received from the bvi government as of september  to repay the remaining accounts receivable balances relating to period prior to december  oc bvi continues to apply the equivalent of the cash method with respect to the recognition of revenues from baughers bay 
consequently  oc bvi does not recognize as revenues any amounts to be paid to oc bvi as a result of the court ruling until such amounts are paid by the bvi government 
to date  the bvi government has paid oc bvi million of the million awarded by the court 
in february  the bvi government announced that it had signed a year contract with another company for the construction and operation of a water plant that will provide potable water to the greater tortola area and we believe will replace the current production of the baughers bay plant 
in march  oc bvi vacated the baughers bay plant and the bvi government assumed direct responsibility for the plant s operations 
we account for our investment in oc bvi in accordance with the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this method requires recognition of a loss on an equity investment that is other than temporary  and indicates that a current fair value of an equity investment that is less than its carrying amount may indicate a loss in the value of the investment 
to test for possible impairment of our investment in oc bvi  we estimate its fair value as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
in making this estimate  we calculate the expected cash flows from our investment in oc bvi by i estimating the expected cash flows from oc bvi s contract with the bvi government to supply water from its bar bay plant  ii identifying various possible outcomes of the baughers bay litigation and estimating the expected cash flows associated with each possible outcome  and iii assigning a probability to each baughers bay outcome and associated expected cash flows based upon discussions held to date by oc bvi s management with the bvi government and oc bvi s legal counsel 
the resulting probability weighted sum represents the expected cash flows  and our best estimate of future cash flows  to be derived from our investment in oc bvi  which are present valued to estimate oc bvi s fair value 
after considering the impact of the september and october rulings of the court and the decision by the bvi government to enter into the agreement with another company to build a new plant to serve tortola  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi exceeded the estimated fair value for our investment in oc bvi and therefore recognized impairment losses aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  based upon the estimated fair value determined as of december  we concluded that no impairment loss was required to be recognized on our investment in oc bvi during the year ended december  this conclusion assumes that the bvi government will fulfill its obligations under the contract for the bar bay plant and that oc bvi will collect all of the million awarded by the court of which only million has been received to date 
should the bvi government be successful in its appeal to reduce the million court award  we will be required to record charges that will reduce our earnings by an amount approximately equal to of any reduction of the million previously awarded by the court 
if the appellate court ultimately overturns the ruling of the court or the appellate court reduces the amount awarded to oc bvi under the court order  or the bvi government fails to honor the terms of its agreement for water supplied by oc bvi s bar bay plant  the actual cash flows from oc bvi could vary materially from the expected cash flows we used in determining oc bvi s fair value as of december  and we would be required to record an additional impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of our investment in oc bvi 
such impairment loss would reduce our earnings and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill valuation the market price of our common stock has declined over the past twelve months and at times during this period  our market capitalization has been less than the carrying value of our stockholders equity 
the staff of the division of corporation finance of the us securities and exchange commission the staff has inquired through comment letters issued in connection with their periodic reviews of our recent annual and quarterly filings as to what consideration we have given to recognizing an impairment of our goodwill in light of the extent  and the duration of time  our market capitalization has been below the carrying value of our stockholders equity 
we have responded to the staff that  based upon our impairment testing for  we have concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  at their request  we have provided the staff with the supporting calculations  assumptions and methodologies utilized for our goodwill impairment testing 
the staff is presently reviewing this information 
our goodwill amounted to  as of december  while we have concluded that this goodwill was not impaired as of december   the staff could disagree with our conclusion and we could ultimately be required to record an impairment charge for a portion or all of this goodwill as of december  or as of a later date 
such impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  or the results of operations for future periods 
mexico affiliate in may  we acquired  through our wholly owned netherlands subsidiary  consolidated water cooperatief  ua  a interest in nsc agua  nsc de nsc  nsc a mexican company 
nsc has been formed to pursue a project encompassing the construction  ownership and operation of a million gallon per day seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant to be located in northern baja california  mexico and an accompanying pipeline to deliver water to a mexican potable water system and the us border 
we believe such a project can be successful due to what we anticipate will be a growing need for a new potable water supply for the areas of northern baja california  mexico and southern california  united states 
to complete this project  we have engaged an engineering group with extensive regional experience and have partnered with doosan heavy industries and construction  a global leader in the engineering  procurement and construction of large seawater desalination plants 
once completed  we would operate the plant while retaining a minority position in its ownership 
nsc is in the development stage  and is presently involved in i extending contracts for the purchase of land on which to build the plant  ii seeking contracts for the electric power and feed water sources for the plant s proposed operations  and iii implementing a water quality monitoring and equipment testing program at the proposed feed water source 
in addition to completing these activities  nsc will be required to complete various other steps before it can commence construction of the plant and pipeline including  but not limited to  obtaining approvals and permits from various governmental agencies in mexico and the united states  securing contracts with its proposed customers to sell water in sufficient quantities and at prices that make the project financially viable  and obtaining equity and debt financing for the project 
nsc s potential customers will also be required to obtain various governmental permits and approvals in order to purchase water from nsc 
for our interest in nsc  we agreed to provide initial funding of up to million in the form of equity for nsc s development activities 
as of june  we had met this initial funding commitment 
because we exercise effective financial control over nsc and our partners in nsc did not participate in funding the first million in losses that nsc incurred  we consolidate nsc s results of operations 
included in our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and are approximately and million respectively in general and administrative expenses from nsc  consisting of organizational  legal  accounting  engineering  consulting and other costs relating to its project development activities 
the assets and liabilities of nsc included in our consolidated balance sheet amounted to approximately  and  respectively  as of december  and approximately  and  respectively  as of december  in february  we acquired an option  exercisable through february   to purchase the shares of one of the other shareholders of nsc along with an immediate power of attorney to vote those shares 
as a result  we now have effective control over nsc and are continuing its project development activities 
we have determined that completing nsc s development activities will require significantly more funding than has been expended to date 
we may choose to fund these development activities ourselves or may seek funding from additional sources 
we may incur significant development expenses in the future for this project without ultimately being able to obtain the funding necessary for nsc to build the project 
we estimate that it will take at least two years for nsc to complete all of the development activities which include initiating site piloting plant activities  extending purchase agreements for the land for the plant  securing feed water and power supplies  completing the engineering and feasibility studies  negotiating customer contracts  obtaining required regulatory permits and arranging the project financing necessary to commence construction of the plant 
however nsc may ultimately be unable to complete all of the activities necessary to begin construction of the project 
cw belize by statutory instrument no 
of  the minister of public utilities of the government of belize published an order  the public utility provider class declaration order  the order  which as of may  designated cw belize as public utility provider under the laws of belize 
with this designation  the public utilities commission of belize the puc has the authority to set the rates charged by cw belize and to otherwise regulate its activities 
on november   cw belize received a formal complaint from the puc alleging that cw belize was operating without a license under the terms of the water industry act 
cw belize applied for this license in december on july  the puc issued the san pedro public water supply quality and security complaint order the second order which among other things requires that i cw belize and its customer jointly make a submission to the responsible minister requesting that the area surrounding cw belize s seawater abstraction wells be designated a forest reserve or national park and be designated a controlled area under section of the water industry act  ii cw belize submit an operations manual for cw belize s desalination plant to the puc for approval  iii cw belize and its customer modify the water supply agreement between the parties to a include new water quality parameters included in the order and b cap the current exclusive water supply arrangement in the agreement at maximum of  gallons per day  iv cw belize keeps a minimum number of replacement seawater ro membranes in stock at all times and v cw belize takes possession of and reimburses the puc for certain equipment which the puc purchased from a third party in late cw belize has applied for declaratory judgment and has been granted a temporary injunction to stay the enforcement of the second order by the puc until such time as the matter can be heard by the belize courts 
we are presently unable to determine what impact the order and the second order will have on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows

as of december   b  of the series a bonds were outstanding 
we have elected to redeem the remaining b  of these bonds outstanding on march  cw bahamas liquidity cw bahamas was due approximately million and million from the wsc as of december  and february   respectively 
we have been informed previously by representatives of the bahamas government that the delay in paying our accounts receivables is due to operating issues within the wsc  that the delay does not reflect any type of dispute with us with respect to the amounts owed  and that the amounts will ultimately be paid in full 
we believe that the accounts receivable from the wsc are fully collectible and therefore have not provided any allowance for possible non payment of these receivables as of december  transfers of us dollars from cw bahamas to our other subsidiaries require authorization in advance from the central bank of the bahamas 
cw bahamas performance bonds we have two contracts  one for our windsor plant and one for our blue hills plant  to supply water to the wsc 
each contract requires us to guarantee delivery of a minimum quantity of water per week 
if we do not meet this minimum  we are required to pay the wsc for the difference between the minimum and actual gallons delivered at a per gallon rate equal to the price per gallon that wsc is currently paying us under the contract 
the windsor and blue hills contracts expire in and  respectively and require us to deliver million imperial gallons and million imperial gallons  respectively  of water each week 
we are required to provide the wsc with performance and operating guarantees  in the form of bank issued letters of credit  to secure any payments we may be required to make under the minimum delivery requirements of the windsor contract 
a performance bond in the amount of  for the windsor plant has expired and was not subsequently replaced

impact of inflation under the terms of our cayman islands license and our water sales agreements in belize  bahamas and the british virgin islands  our water rates are automatically adjusted for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary exceptions 
we  therefore  believe that the impact of inflation on our gross profit  measured in consistent dollars  will not be material 
however  significant increases in items such as fuel and energy costs could create additional credit risks for us  as our customers ability to pay our invoices could be adversely affected by such increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk credit risk we are not exposed to significant credit risk on retail customer accounts in the cayman islands as our policy is to cease supply of water to customers whose accounts are more than days overdue 
our primary exposure to credit risk is from accounts receivable arising from bulk water sales to the governments of belize  the bahamas  the british virgin islands  and the cayman islands 
as of december   we had approximately million in loans receivable due from the water authority cayman 
these loans were current as to scheduled principal and interest payments as of december interest rate risk we are not exposed to significant interest rate risk as the annual interest rates on our series a bonds and bonds are fixed at and  respectively 
we have elected to redeem on march  the remaining b  of series a bonds outstanding 
foreign exchange risk all of the currencies in our operating areas other than the mexican peso and the euro have been fixed to the united states dollar for over years and we do not employ a hedging strategy against exchange rate risk associated with our reporting in united states dollars 
if any of these fixed exchange rates becomes a floating exchange rate our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected
