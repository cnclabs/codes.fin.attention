on may  we changed our name to sourceforge  inc in november  we changed our name to geeknet  inc our business consists of two operating segments e commerce and media 
our e commerce segment sells technology themed retail products for technology enthusiasts through our thinkgeek 
com web site 
we offer a broader range of unique products in a single web property than are available in traditional brick and mortar stores 
we introduce a range of new products to our audience on a regular basis and develop and sell our own geek labs custom products 
our media segment provides web properties that serve as platforms for the creation  review and distribution of online peer produced content 
our audience of technology professionals and enthusiasts relies on our web properties  sourceforge  slashdot  and freecode  to create  improve  compare and distribute open source software and to research  debate and discuss current issues relating to the technology marketplace 
thinkgeek s business strategy is to increase revenue by expanding the range of new and innovative products we sell  including products we develop  and by increasing traffic to our site and customer conversion 
we also develop and sell our own geek labs custom products 
we attract traffic to our sites using a variety of traditional online and direct retail marketing channels including paid search  and e mail to our customers and followers 
we continue to use the capabilities of the internet  including social networking sites such as facebook  twitter and youtube  to increase brand awareness and also to communicate with our customers 
in  we changed our warehouse provider to exel  inc and invested in modern automated distribution equipment in lockbourne  ohio 
this has allowed us to continue to develop our distribution capabilities to provide a high level of service to our customers 
we currently use the following key metrics to measure our e commerce business 
table of contents year ended december  daily unique visitors in thousands orders received in thousands conversion rate average order value received unique visitor is the aggregate average unique visitors for the e commerce site during the period presented 
this metric includes visitors who may visit our e commerce site on more than one day during the period 
geeknet media is a social media destination for business to business technology 
our sites connect millions of influential technology professionals and enthusiasts 
our strategy targets business to business technology companies and their advertising agencies with the goal of increasing revenue per page 
during  we hired individuals with the experience and capability of providing a greater variety of lead generation programs directly to our customers 
we believe that customers value lead generation programs and that these programs will have the potential to constitute a growing source of future revenue 
we are also focused on increasing the monetization of our international traffic and currently have a sales professionals in london  england  to develop and implement strategies to increase international revenue and we have agreements with representatives in europe  australia and asia to market and sell our advertising products 
we continue to invest in our web properties sourceforge  slashdot  and freecode 
in the first half of  we launched an open source version of our platform for developers of open source projects  named allura 
the new version includes source code repositories  bug reports  discussions  mailing lists  wiki pages and blogs 
it demonstrates our commitment to the open source community 
in the second half of  we focused heavily on the sourceforge directory and released a number of improvements to make it easier to find great open source software 
the redesigned directory includes a new browse experience  better project summary page  reviews and ratings  and improved search results 
we also launched a new mirror directory  enabling an expanded catalog with projects that may not be developed on sourceforge 
this will help users see a greater selection of software to choose from when searching for applications 
on freecode  formerly named freshmeat  we completed a site rebrand 
finally on slashdot  we made several enhancements which improved the user experience  site performance  and scalability 
we currently use the following key metrics which are derived from data provided by google analytics to measure our media business year ended december  unique visitors per month in thousands visits per unique visitor per month visits per month in thousands pages per visit page views per month in thousands revenue per thousand pages rpm revenue per user rpu unique visitor is the aggregate average unique visitors for all online media sites during the period presented 
this does not consider possible duplicate visitors who may visit more than one of our web sites during the month or may visit from a different device or platform 
in the third quarter  we made changes to our site to account for this calculation which may result in the number of unique visitors  visits per unique visitor and visits per month to decrease while pages per visit may increase 
this change will not affect page views per month 
per month amounts are the average calculated as the total amount for the period divided by the months in the period 
the numbers have been changed for comparative purposes and do not include rss feeds 
rss feeds are no longer tracked by google analytics 
rpu is an annualized amount based on revenue and unique users during the period presented 
a key element of our growth plans is to increase engagement 
our metrics around engagement per user are an important measure  and we are focused on both growing the number of unique visitors and deepening the average levels of engagement 
critical accounting policies 
table of contents accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  inventories  the assessment of impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  stock based compensation and contingencies and litigation 
revenue recognition e commerce revenue thinkgeek revenue is derived from the online sale of consumer goods 
we recognize thinkgeek revenue from the sale of consumer goods when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in general  we recognize e commerce revenue when products are delivered and title transfers to the customer 
thinkgeek also engages in the sale of gift certificates 
when a gift certificate is sold we defer the revenue until the certificate is redeemed 
once the certificate is redeemed and the products are delivered we recognize the revenue 
the balance in our deferred revenue at december  relating to gift certificates was million 
we generally grant customers a day right to return products and based on historical experience  we have recorded reserve for estimated returns of million and million at december   and december   respectively 
thinkgeek s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the calendar year end holiday shopping season 
in the past several years  a substantial portion of the company s thinkgeek revenue has occurred in the company s fourth quarter which begins on october and ends on december as is typical in the retail industry  the company generally experiences lower monthly revenue during the first nine months of the year 
the company s thinkgeek revenue in a particular period is not necessarily indicative of future revenue for a subsequent quarter or a full year 
media revenue media revenue is derived primarily from advertising on our various web sites or from lead generation information provided to our customers 
advertisements include various forms of rich media and banner advertising  text links and sponsorships  while lead generation information utilizes advertising and other methods to deliver leads to a customer 
we recognize media advertising revenue as advertisements are displayed  and recognize lead generation revenue as leads are delivered to our customer  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized as the lesser of actual delivery or on a straight line basis over the contractual campaign period 
our obligations may include guarantees of a minimum number of impressions the number of times that an advertisement is viewed by visitors to our web sites 
inventories inventories related to our e commerce segment consist solely of finished goods that are valued at the lower of cost  using the weighted average cost method  or market 
we review inventories quarterly and when required reduce estimated excess and obsolete inventories to their net realizable values 
long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets in measuring whether they are recoverable 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  a loss is recorded as the excess of the asset s carrying value over fair value 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
goodwill 
table of contents we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our annual testing date is december impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying net assets  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company has two reporting units e commerce and media 
all goodwill is related the media reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the preparation of the goodwill impairment analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the determination of fair values of reporting units and tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions  which include future values  are often subjective and may differ significantly from period to period based on changes in the overall economic environment  changes in our business and changes in our strategy or our internal forecasts 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at grant date fair value and recognize the expense net of estimated forfeitures for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
calculating compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option grant  stock price volatility  and the pre vesting option forfeiture rate 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
we estimate stock price volatility based on historical volatility in our stock 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised  or canceled 
contingencies and litigation we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of any loss contingency required is assessed and recorded  if probable  after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required loss contingencies may change in the future as the facts and circumstances of each matter change
