we also provide a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates as well as a description of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results 
you should read the following information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f in this annual report on form k  as well as the information set forth in item a 
risk factors 
our business we own and operate commercial radio station clusters throughout the united states 
we believe we are the largest pure play radio broadcaster in the united states based on number of stations owned and operated 
at december   we owned or operated approximately radio stations including under lmas in united states media markets and operated nationwide radio networks serving over  affiliates 
at december   under lmas  we provided sales and marketing services for seven radio stations in the united states 
we are a delaware corporation  organized in  and successor by merger to an illinois corporation with the same name that had been organized in operating overview and highlights we believe that by completing the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition we have created a leading radio broadcasting company with a true national platform and with an opportunity to further leverage and expand upon our strengths  market presence and programming 
specifically  with the completion of these acquisitions  we now have an extensive radio station portfolio consisting of approximately radio stations  including a presence in eight of the top markets  and broad diversity in format  listener base  geography  advertiser base and revenue stream  all of which are designed to reduce dependence on any single demographic  region or industry 
we believe our increased scale will allow larger  more significant investments in the local digital media marketplace and allow our local digital platforms and strategies  including our social commerce initiatives  to be applied across significant additional markets 
furthermore  the acquisition of citadel s nationwide radio networks  consisting of approximately  station affiliates and  program affiliates  which reach approximately million listeners weekly  are intended to create a national network platform for the syndication of our fully distributed content and technology assets 
cumulus believes that the capital structure resulting from the completion of the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  and our related financing transactions  will provide increased liquidity and scale for cumulus to pursue and finance strategic acquisitions in the future 
we also believe that we have substantially completed our integration that will enable us to realize synergies of million on an annualized basis resulting from the integration of citadel s historical operations  which when combined with the expected incremental revenues therefrom and the other expected benefits from the foregoing transactions  should strongly position cumulus for future growth in what we believe is still a highly fragmented industry 
as we entered  we forecasted that advertising revenues in our markets would experience only modest growth in certain categories  offset by the absence of robust political spending throughout our principal focus for potential revenue growth in was primarily on local advertising expected to be fueled largely by the continued recovery of the automotive advertising sector 
looking back on our results for  we believe our actual experience and results were generally consistent with that forecast 
certain key operating and financial highlights in  both of which are discussed in more detail below  are as follows throughout  we experienced a generally stable operating environment  overcoming the short term negative macroeconomic impacts of the march japanese tsunami and related events that temporarily disrupted the automobile industry  our largest advertising category and the financial market disruptions associated with the us debt ceiling debates 
as a result  our operating income decreased  and 
table of contents in connection with the completion of the citadel acquisition  we completed our previously announced global refinancing 
acquisition of cmp we completed the cmp acquisition on august  as a result of the cmp acquisition  cmp became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
cmp s operating results have been included in cumulus accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of the completion of the cmp acquisition 
pursuant to a management agreement  we had operated cmp s business since in connection with the cmp acquisition  we issued million shares of our common stock to the cmp sellers 
also in connection with the cmp acquisition  the million outstanding warrants to purchase stock of a subsidiary of cmp were amended and restated to become exercisable for up to million shares of our common stock 
for additional information regarding the cmp acquisition  see note  description of business  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  acquisitions and dispositions 
acquisition of citadel and related financing transactions we completed the citadel acquisition on september  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  consisting of approximately billion in cash  the issuance of million shares of our class a common stock  including million restricted shares  warrants to purchase million shares of class a common stock  million warrants held in reserve for potential future issuance related to the pending final settlement of certain outstanding unsecured claims arising from citadel s emergence from bankruptcy  and the consideration to repay the outstanding debt of citadel 
as a result of the citadel acquisition  citadel became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of cumulus 
citadel s operating results have been included in cumulus accompanying audited consolidated financial statements since the date of the completion of the citadel acquisition see note  acquisitions and dispositions 
also on september  and in connection with the citadel acquisition  we issued and sold million shares of class a common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of class a common stock to an affiliate of crestview   shares of series a preferred stock to an affiliate of macquarie  and million shares of class a common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase million shares of class a common stock to ubs and certain other entities 
in connection with the closing of the citadel acquisition and the completion of our previously announced global refinancing  on september   we repaid approximately billion in outstanding senior or subordinated indebtedness and other obligations of a the company  b certain of our other wholly owned subsidiaries  and c citadel 
this global refinancing  and the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the citadel acquisition  were funded with i billion in borrowings under a new first lien term loan  million in borrowings under a new first lien revolving credit facility and million in borrowings under a new second lien term loan  all as described in more detail in note  long term debt  and ii proceeds from the sale of million of our common stock  preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements under the securities act 
the million of senior notes issued by us in may remain outstanding see note  acquisitions and dispositions 
also in connection with the citadel acquisition and as part of the transactions contemplated by the global refinancing  the company completed an internal restructuring into a holding company structure  which included transferring the remaining assets and operations held directly or indirectly by us  other than the equity interests of our direct wholly owned subsidiary cumulus holdings  to cumulus holdings 
in connection with the internal restructuring  all obligations under the indenture were assigned to and assumed by cumulus holdings  which was substituted for us as the issuer and primary obligor thereunder  and we provided a guarantee of all such obligations of cumulus holdings 

table of contents liquidity considerations historically  our principal needs for funds have been for acquisitions of radio stations  expenses associated with our station and corporate operations  capital expenditures  and interest and debt service payments 
we believe that our funding needs in the future will be for substantially similar matters including  but not limited to  expected capital expenditures associated with implementing hd radio technology  as well as expenses relating to the ongoing integration of citadel and cmp into our company and additional expenses incurred in connection with those operations  including the operations of our acquired radio network 
our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under credit facilities in existence from time to time 
our cash flow from operations is subject to such factors as shifts in population  station listenership  demographics  or audience tastes  and fluctuations in preferred advertising media 
in addition  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us  which risks may be exacerbated in challenging economic periods 
in recent periods  management has taken steps to mitigate this risk through heightened collection efforts and enhancements to our credit approval process  although no assurances as to the longer term success of these efforts can be provided 
in addition  we believe the acquisition of the broad diversity in format  listener base  geography  advertiser base and revenue stream that accompanied the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition should help us reduce dependence on any single demographic  region or industry 
on september  in connection with the closing of the citadel acquisition and in order to complete the global refinancing  the company entered into the first lien facility and the second lien facility 
the first lien facility consists of a billion first lien term loan facility  net of an original issue discount of million  maturing in september the first lien term loan and a million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility  and matures in september the second lien facility consists of a million second lien term loan net of an original discount of million the second lien term loan  and matures in september on that date and also in connection therewith  the company used borrowings of billion under the first lien term loan  million under the revolving credit facility and million under the second lien term loan  along with proceeds from the equity investment  to i fund the cash portion of the purchase price paid in the citadel acquisition  ii repay in full amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility under our then existing credit agreement the terminated credit agreement  iii repay all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of cmpsc  iv redeem cmpsc s outstanding senior subordinated notes due and variable rate senior secured notes due  v redeem in accordance with their terms all outstanding shares of preferred stock of cmp susquehanna radio holdings corp 
radio holdings  and vi repay all amounts outstanding  including any accrued interest and the premiums thereon  under citadel s pre existing credit agreement and to redeem citadel s senior notes due the million of senior notes issued by the company in may remain outstanding  with cumulus holdings substituted as the issuer thereunder pursuant to the internal restructuring 
pursuant to the equity investment  on september   the company issued and sold i million shares of class a common stock to crestview  ii  shares of series a preferred stock to macquarie  and iii million shares of class a common stock and immediately exercisable warrants to purchase million shares of its class a common stock to ubs and certain other investors 
also pursuant thereto  the company issued the crestview warrants to purchase million shares of class a common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
dividends on the series a preferred stock accrue at a rate of per annum for the first six months from issuance  and per annum for the period commencing on march  and ending on september   with additional increases for every two year period thereafter 
the dividends are payable in cash  except that  at the option of the company  up to of the dividends for any period may be paid through the issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock 
payment of dividends on the series a preferred stock is in preference and prior to any dividends payable on any class of the company s common stock and  in the event of any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the company  holders of series a preferred stock are entitled to the liquidation value thereof prior to  and in preference of  payment of any amounts to holders of any class of the company s common stock 
we have assessed the current and expected implications of our business climate  our current and expected needs for funds and our current and expected sources of funds and determined  based on our financial condition as of december   that cash on hand  cash expected to be generated from operating activities and borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  interest and debt service payments  and repurchases of securities and other debt obligations through december  
table of contents advertising revenue and adjusted ebitda our primary source of revenues is the sale of advertising time on our radio stations 
our sales of advertising time are primarily affected by the demand for advertising time from local  regional and national advertisers and the advertising rates charged by our radio stations 
advertising demand and rates are based primarily on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by various ratings agencies on a periodic basis 
we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty and we believe that the diversification of formats on our stations helps to insulate them from the effects of changes in the musical tastes of the public with respect to any particular format 
in addition  we believe that the radio station portfolio that we own and operate as a result of the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  which has increased diversity in terms of format  listener base  geography  advertiser base and revenue stream  will further reduce our revenue dependence on any single demographic  region or industry 
our radio stations strive to maximize revenue by managing their on air inventory of advertising time and adjusting prices up or down based on supply and demand 
the optimal number of advertisements available for sale depends on the programming format of a particular station 
each of our stations has a general target level of on air inventory available for advertising 
this target level of inventory for sale may vary at different times of the day but tends to remain stable over time 
we seek to broaden our base of advertisers in each of our markets by providing a wide array of audience demographic segments across our cluster of stations  thereby providing each of our potential advertisers with an effective means of reaching a targeted demographic group 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations sometimes utilize trade or barter agreements that exchange advertising time for goods or services such as travel or lodging  instead of for cash 
trade revenue totaled million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our advertising contracts are generally short term 
we generate most of our revenue from local and regional advertising  which is sold primarily by a station s sales staff 
local and regional advertising represented approximately  and of our total revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our recently acquired radio networks generate substantially all of their revenue from the sale of advertising time accumulated from their affiliate stations 
typically  in exchange for the right to broadcast radio network programming  its affiliates remit a portion of their advertising time  which is then aggregated into packages focused on specific demographic groups and sold by our radio networks to our advertiser clients that want to reach the listeners who comprise those demographic groups on a national basis 
our radio networks generate advertising revenue by embedding a defined number of advertising units in their syndicated programs  which they sell to advertisers at premium prices 
our advertising revenues vary by quarter throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our first calendar quarter produces the lowest revenues during the last twelve month period  as advertising generally declines following the winter holidays 
the second and fourth calendar quarters typically produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotion expenses that typically do not have an effect on revenue generation until future periods  if at all 
we continually evaluate opportunities to increase revenues through new platforms  including technology based initiatives 
adjusted ebitda is the financial metric utilized by management to analyze the cash flow generated by the company s business 
this measure isolates the amount of income generated by its radio stations after the incurrence of corporate general and administrative expenses 
management also uses this measure to determine the contribution of the company s radio station portfolio  including the corporate resources employed to manage the portfolio  to the funding of its other operating expenses and to the funding of debt service and acquisitions 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining our compliance with certain covenants contained in our first lien facility 
in deriving this measure  management excludes depreciation  amortization and non cash stock based compensation expense from the measure  as these do not represent cash payments for activities related to the operation of the radio stations 
in addition  we also exclude lma fees from our calculation of adjusted ebitda  even though such fees require a cash settlement  because they are excluded from the definition of adjusted ebitda contained in our first lien facility 
management excludes any gain or loss on the exchange of radio stations as it does not represent a cash transaction 
management also excludes any realized gain or loss on derivative instruments as it does not represent a cash transaction nor is it associated with radio station operations 
management excludes impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as it does not require a cash outlay 
management believes that adjusted ebitda  although not a measure that is calculated in accordance with gaap  nevertheless is commonly employed by the investment community as a measure for determining the market value of a radio company 
management has also observed that adjusted ebitda is routinely employed to evaluate and negotiate the potential purchase price for radio broadcasting companies  and is a key metric for purposes of calculating and determining compliance with certain covenants in our first lien facility 
given the relevance to the overall value of the company  management believes that investors consider the metric to be extremely useful 

table of contents adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure for determining the company s operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
a quantitative reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  follows in this section 
results of operations primarily as a result of the completion of the significant transactions described above in  cumulus believes that its results of operations for the year ended december   and its financial condition at such date  will provide only limited comparability to prior periods 
investors are cautioned to not place undue reliance on any such comparison

table of contents our management s discussion and analysis of results of operations for the three years ended december   has been presented on a historical basis 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
excluding the impact of net revenues as a result of the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced political advertising following the mid term elections and a decrease in management fee income which had been earned by us for services provided to cmp prior to the date of the cmp acquisition  partially offset by an increase in core advertising categories  particularly automotive and retail categories 
direct operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
excluding the impact of direct operating expenses as a result of the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  direct operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a reduction in fixed sales expenses and other operating costs 
depreciation and amortization 
excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization as a result of the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets becoming fully depreciated 
lma fees 
excluding the impact of lma fees as a result of the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  lma fees for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  corporate general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation expense 
corporate  general and administrative expenses  including stock based compensation expense for year ended december   increased million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily comprised of million in one time costs associated with the cmp acquisition and the citadel acquisition  additional personnel costs of million as a result of the acquisitions  an increase of million in stock based compensation expenses and increases in other corporate expense items 
gain on exchange of assets or stations 
during  we completed an exchange transaction with clear channel communications  inc clear channel to swap our canton  ohio station for eight of clear channel s radio stations in the ann arbor and battle creek  michigan markets 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million 
we did not complete any similar transactions in realized loss on derivative instruments 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  related to our recording of the fair market value of a put option the green bay option that allows clear channel to require the company to repurchase the five green bay radio stations at any time during the two month period commencing july  or earlier if the lma with clear channel relating to the green bay stations is terminated before this date for million the fair value of the radio stations as of april  
we entered into the green bay option in conjunction with an asset exchange in the second quarter of impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we recorded approximately million of charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill for the year ended december  the impairment loss is related to the broadcasting licenses and goodwill recorded in conjunction with our annual impairment testing conducted during the fourth quarter see note  intangible assets and goodwill in the notes to the financial statements that accompany in this report 
there were no similar asset impairment charges during the year ended december  interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense associated with outstanding debt increased by million to million as compared to million in the prior year period 
interest expense increased due to a higher average amount of indebtedness outstanding as a result of the global refinancing in the third quarter of the following summary details the components of our interest expense  net of interest income dollars in thousands

for the year ended december   we recorded million in loss on early extinguishment of debt as a result of our debt refinancing in may there was not a similar extinguishment of debt during terminated transaction expense income 
for the year ended december   we incurred million in costs  which were paid in and were associated with the settlement of litigation related to our since terminated attempt to purchase radio station wtke fm in holt  florida see note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to the financial statements that accompany this report 
we had no similar expense for the year ended december  gain on equity investment in cmp 
for the year ended december   we recorded an million gain on our equity investment in cmp due to the cmp acquisition 
there was not a similar gain during the year ended december  see note  acquisitions and dispositions 
income tax benefit expense 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million as compared to a million expense during the prior year 
the income tax benefit for is primarily due to a release of the valuation allowance as a result of the cmp acquisition and citadel acquisition while the tax expense is primarily due to tax amortization of intangibles 
adjusted ebitda 
as a result of the factors described above  adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  reconciliation of non gaap financial measure 
the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations dollars in thousands 
table of contents year ended december  change net income depreciation and amortization lma fees non cash stock based compensation expense gain on exchange of assets or stations realized loss on derivative instrument impairment of intangible assets and goodwill interest expense  net terminated transaction expense other income  net loss on early extinguishment of debt gain on equity investment in cmp income tax benefit expense adjusted ebitda intangible assets including goodwill  net 
intangible assets  net of amortization  were  million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill 
intangible assets  net  increased from the prior year due to the acquisitions of cmp and citadel in we continue to monitor whether any impairment triggers are present and we may be required to record material impairment charges in future periods 
our impairment testing requires us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth of our businesses 
additionally the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairments tests are performed 
the following factors could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to an million increase in national and political revenue which was offset by a decrease of million spread over the remainder of the revenue categories 
we believe that advertising revenue in our markets will have modest growth through the first half of as the local advertising marketplace becomes more robust in conjunction with improved macroeconomic conditions 
we also believe we will see continued growth in national advertising spending  although at lower levels than we experienced in while we anticipate continued strength in our core advertising categories into the second half of  we will face a tougher comparison period due to the absence of cyclical political spending 
overall  we are experiencing a much more normalized marketplace than seen in recent years 
direct operating expenses  excluding depreciation  amortization and lma fees 
direct operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to a million decrease in programming expense and a million decrease in sales expense 
we will continue to monitor all our operating costs and to the extent we are able to identify any additional cost saving measures  we will implement them as needed to remain in compliance with current and future debt covenant requirements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   resulting from a decrease in our asset base due to assets becoming fully depreciated coupled with a decrease in capital expenditures 

table of contents lma fees 
lma fees for the year ended december  decreased million to million compared to million for the year ended december lma fees in were comprised primarily of fees associated with stations operated under lmas in cedar rapids  iowa  ann arbor  michigan  green bay  wisconsin  and battle creek  michigan 
corporate general and administrative expenses  including non cash stock based compensation expense 
corporate operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in non recurring severance costs of million  a decrease of million in consulting and professional fees  with the remaining million decrease attributable to miscellaneous expenses 
gain on exchange of assets or stations 
during we completed an exchange transaction with clear channel to swap five of our radio stations in green bay  wisconsin for two of clear channel s radio stations located in cincinnati  ohio 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a gain of approximately million during we did not complete any similar transactions in realized loss on derivative instrument

interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  while overall interest expense decreased  the interest expense associated with outstanding debt increased by million to million as compared to million in the prior year s period 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in the borrowing base due to the pay down of approximately million of debt compared to the same period in the prior year 
additionally  interest expense increased by million related to the yield adjustment on the interest rate swap 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap option agreement

intangible assets  net of amortization  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these intangible asset balances primarily consist of broadcast licenses and goodwill 
intangible assets  net  decreased from the prior year primarily due to a million impairment charge taken for the year ended december   in connection with our annual impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of  which was offset by the purchase of million of intangible assets in seasonality and cyclicality we expect that our operations and revenues will continue to be seasonal in nature  with generally lower revenue generated in the first quarter of the year and generally higher revenue generated in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
the seasonality of our business reflects the adult orientation of our formats and relationship between advertising purchases on these formats with the retail cycle 
this seasonality causes and will likely continue to cause a variation in our quarterly operating results 
such variations could have a material effect on the timing of our cash flows 
in addition  our revenues tend to fluctuate between years  consistent with  among other things  increased advertising expenditures in even numbered years by political candidates  political parties and special interest groups 
this political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  our management  in consultation with the audit committee of our board  evaluates these estimates  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast 

table of contents accounts receivable and concentration of credit risks accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on several factors including the length of time receivables are past due  trends and current economic factors 
all balances are reviewed and evaluated on a consolidated basis 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
in the opinion of our management  credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of our diversified customers and the geographic diversification of our customer base 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and believe that adequate allowances for any uncollectible accounts receivable are maintained 
intangible assets we have significant intangible assets recorded in our accounts 
these intangible assets are comprised primarily of broadcast licenses and goodwill acquired through the acquisition of radio stations 
we are required to review the carrying value of certain intangible assets and our goodwill annually for impairment  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  and record any impairment to results of operations in the periods in which the recorded value of those assets is more than their fair value 
we did not have any impairment during the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded aggregate impairment charges of million  to reduce the carrying value of certain broadcast licenses and goodwill to their respective fair values 
as of december   we had billion in intangible assets and goodwill  which represented approximately of our total assets 
we perform our annual impairment tests for indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill during the fourth quarter 
the impairment tests require us to make certain assumptions in determining fair value  including assumptions about the cash flow growth rates of our businesses 
additionally  the fair values are significantly impacted by macroeconomic factors  including market multiples at the time the impairment tests are performed 
more specifically  the following could adversely impact the current carrying value of our broadcast licenses and goodwill a sustained decline in the price of our common stock  b the potential for a decline in our forecasted operating profit margins or expected cash flow growth rates  c a decline in our industry forecasted operating profit margins  d the potential for a continued decline in advertising market revenues within the markets we operate stations  or e the sustained decline in the selling prices of radio stations 
the calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit is prepared using an income approach and discounted cash flow methodology 
as part of our overall planning associated with the testing of goodwill  we have determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the reporting units are based on currently available data and management s best estimates and  accordingly  a change in market conditions or other factors could have a material effect on the estimated values 
we generally conducted our impairment tests as follows step goodwill test in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill  the fair value of each market was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  an income approach 
the discounted cash flow approach requires the projection of future cash flows and the calculation of these cash flows into their present value equivalent via a discount rate 
we used an approximate five year projection period to derive operating cash flow projections from a market participant view 
we made certain assumptions regarding future revenue growth based on industry market data and historical performance 
we then projected future operating expenses in order to derive operating profits  which we combined with working capital additions and capital expenditures to determine operating cash flows 
for our annual impairment test  we performed the step goodwill test the step test and compared the fair value of each market to the carrying value of its net assets as of december  this test was used to determine if any of our markets have an indicator of impairment ie the market net asset carrying value was greater than the calculated fair value of the market 
our analysis determined that  based on our step test  the fair value of all our markets containing goodwill balances were above their carrying value 
since no impairment indicator existed in step  we determined goodwill was appropriately stated as of december  
table of contents the discount rate employed in the fair value calculations of our markets was for our step test 
we believe this discount rate was appropriate and reasonable for estimating the fair value of the markets 
for periods after  we projected annual revenue growth based on industry data and historical performance 
we derived projected expense growth based primarily on the stations historical financial performance and expected growth 
our projections were based on then current market and economic conditions and our historical knowledge of the markets 
to validate our conclusions and determine the reasonableness of our assumptions  we conducted an overall check of our fair value calculations by comparing the implied fair value of our markets  in aggregate  to our market capitalization as of december  as compared with the market capitalization value of billion as of december   the aggregate fair value of all markets of approximately billion was approximately million  or  higher than the market capitalization 
key data points included in the market capitalization calculations were as follows shares outstanding  including certain warrants  of million as of december   closing price of our class a common stock for december  of per share  and total debt  including preferred equity  of  million  on december  utilizing the above analysis and data points  we concluded the fair values of our markets  as calculated  are appropriate and reasonable 
the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of different reporting units under the step test as of december  management s opinion is that the summary form of this table is more meaningful to the reader than presenting each reporting unit separately in assessing the recoverability of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
units of accounting as of december  percentage range by which fair value exceeds carrying value greater than greater than greater than to to to number of reporting units carrying value in thousands step goodwill test we did not perform a step test since the step test did not indicate a potential impairment 
indefinite lived intangibles fcc licenses we perform our annual impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles our fcc licenses during the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
we have combined all of our broadcast licenses within a single geographic market cluster into a single unit of accounting for impairment testing purposes 
as part of the overall planning associated with the indefinite lived intangibles test  we determined that our geographic markets are the appropriate unit of accounting for the broadcast license impairment testing 
as a result of the annual impairment test  we determined that no impairment charge existed for the fcc licenses 
for the annual impairment test of our fcc licenses  including both am and fm licenses  we utilized the income approach  specifically the greenfield method  with the exception of two stations which were not operating as of the valuation date 
a minimum value of  was estimated for the fcc licenses of these two non operating stations 
in completing the appraisals  we conducted a thorough review of all aspects of the assets being valued 

table of contents the income approach measures value based on income generated by the subject property  which is then analyzed and projected over a specified time and capitalized at an appropriate market rate to arrive at the estimated value 
the greenfield method isolates cash flows attributable to the subject asset using a hypothetical start up approach 
the estimated fair values of our fcc licenses represent the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the estimated fair value also assumes the highest and best use of the asset by market participants  considering the use of the asset that is physically possible  legally permissible and financially feasible 
a basic assumption in our valuation of these fcc licenses was that these radio stations were new radio stations  signing on the air as of the date of the valuation 
we assumed the competitive situation that existed in those markets as of that date  except that these stations were just beginning operations 
in doing so  we bifurcated the value of going concern and any other assets acquired  and strictly valued the fcc licenses 
in estimating the value of the am and fm licenses using a discounted cash flow analysis we began with market revenue projections 
next  we estimated the percentage of the market s total revenue  or market share  that market participants could reasonably expect an average start up station to attain  as well as the duration in years required to reach the average market share 
the estimated average market share was computed based on market share data  by type ie  am and fm 
after market revenue and market shares have been estimated  operating expenses  including depreciation based on assumed investment in fixed assets and future capital expenditures  of a start up station or operation are similarly estimated based on industry average cost data 
appropriate income taxes are then subtracted  depreciation added back  estimated capital expenditures subtracted  and working capital adjustments are made to calculate free cash flow during the build up period until a steady state or mature normalized operation is achieved 
we discounted the net free cash flows using an after tax weighted average cost of capital of  and then calculated the total discounted net free cash flows 
for net free cash flows beyond the projection period  we estimated a perpetuity value  and then discounted the amounts to present values 
in order to estimate what listening audience share would be expected for each station by market  we analyzed the average local commercial share garnered by similar am and fm stations competing in those radio markets 
often we made adjustments to the listening share and revenue share based on the stations signal coverage of the market and the surrounding area population as compared to the other stations in the market 
based on our knowledge of the industry and familiarity with similar markets  we determined that approximately three years would be required for the stations to reach maturity 
we also incorporated the following additional assumptions into the discounted cash flow valuation model the projected operating revenues and expenses through  the estimation of initial and on going capital expenditures based on market size  depreciation on initial and on going capital expenditures we calculated depreciation using accelerated double declining balance guidelines over five years for the value of the tangible assets necessary for a radio station to go on the air  the estimation of working capital requirements based on working capital requirements for comparable companies  the calculations of yearly net free cash flows to invested capital  and amortization of the intangible asset the fcc license we calculated amortization on a straight line basis over years 
the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value of radio broadcasting licenses for geographical markets under the step test as of december  management s opinion is that the summary form of this table is more meaningful to the reader in assessing the recoverability of the broadcasting licenses

we have a valuation allowance of approximately million as of december  based on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not these deferred tax assets related to our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other deferred tax assets will be realized 
should we determine that we would be able to realize all or part of these net deferred tax assets in the future  reduction of the valuation allowance would be recorded in income in the period such determination was made stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense recognized under asc topic  compensation share based payment asc  for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million respectively  before income taxes  including million for the year ended december  related to the modified liability awards further discussed at note  stock based compensation expense 
upon adopting asc  for awards with service conditions  a one time election was made to recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
for options with service conditions only  we utilized the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of options issued 
for restricted stock awards with service conditions  we utilized the intrinsic value method 
for restricted stock awards with performance conditions  we have evaluated the probability of vesting of the awards at each reporting period and have adjusted compensation cost based on this assessment 
the fair value is based on the use of certain assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
if other reasonable assumptions were used  the results could differ 
trade transactions we provide advertising time in exchange for certain products  supplies and services 
we include the value of such exchanges in both station revenues and station operating expenses 
trade valuation is based upon our management s estimate of the fair value of the products  supplies and services received 
for the years ended december   and  amounts reflected under trade transactions were trade revenues of million  million and million  respectively  and trade expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  recent accounting pronouncements asu in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb provided additional guidance for performing step of the test for goodwill impairment when an entity has reporting units with zero or negative carrying values 
this accounting standards update asu updates asc to amend the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the company adopted this guidance effective on january  the update did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asu in december  the fasb issued clarification of the accounting guidance related to disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations that occur in the current reporting period 
the guidance requires companies to present pro forma information in their comparative financial statements as if the acquisition date for any business combination that occurred in the current reporting period had occurred at the beginning of the prior year reporting period 
the company adopted this guidance effective january  asu is a disclosure only clarification and its adoption had no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operation 
the company has included the disclosures required pursuant to this guidance in this report 

table of contents asu in may  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements under gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this standard gives clarification for the highest and best use valuation concepts 
the asu also provides guidance on fair value measurements relating to instruments classified in stockholders equity and instruments managed within a portfolio 
further  asu clarifies disclosures for financial instruments categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy that require companies to provide quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  the sensitivity of the measurement to changes in those inputs  and the valuation processes used by the reporting entity 
the company is currently evaluating the newly prescribed disclosures but does not expect they will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
asu in june  the fasb issued asu  which amends the guidance in topic  comprehensive income  by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income oci in the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  the guidance now requires entities to present all non owner changes in stockholders equity either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements of income and comprehensive income 
the components of oci have not changed nor has the guidance on when oci items are reclassified to net income 
similarly  asu does not change the guidance to disclose oci components gross or net of the effect of income taxes  provided that the tax effects are presented on the face of the statement in which oci is presented  or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
the company adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asu in september  the fasb issued asu  which amends asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the amendments in this asu give companies the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if a company concludes that this is the case  it must perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  a company is not required to perform this two step test 
under the amendments in this asu  an entity has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the company adopted this guidance effective january  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asu in december  the fasb issued asu the amendments in this asu require companies to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the asu is required to be applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented and is effective for annual periods for fiscal years beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual fiscal years 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   of our long term debt  or billion  bore interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings and after tax cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the level of borrowings outstanding at december  at variable interest rates and assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate payable on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by million 
as part of our efforts to mitigate interest rate risk  in december  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement with jpmorgan that effectively fixed the interest rate  based on libor  on million of our variable rate borrowings 
the agreement caps the libor based variable interest rate component of our long term debt at a maximum of on an equivalent amount of our term loans 
this agreement is intended to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and was not entered into for speculative purposes 
after giving effect to the impact of this agreement  we had billion of borrowings outstanding at december  that were not subject to the interest rate cap 
assuming a one percentage point change in the average interest rate payable on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased and net income would have decreased by million 
in certain prior periods  we managed our interest rate risk on a portion of our variable rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements in which we received payments based on variable interest rates and made payments based on a fixed interest rate 
these swap agreements expired on march  in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our management would likely take actions  in addition to the interest rate cap agreement discussed above  to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  additional analysis is not possible at this time 

table of contents foreign currency risk none of our operations are measured in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results are not subject to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets
