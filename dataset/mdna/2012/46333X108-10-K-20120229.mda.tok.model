item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are an entrepreneurial pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops and intends to commercialize differentiated medicines that improve patients lives 
to achieve our mission  we are building a team  a culture and processes centered on creating and marketing important new drugs 
we believe that linaclotide  our gc c agonist being developed for the treatment of patients with ibs c and cc  could present patients and healthcare practitioners with a unique therapy for a major medical need not yet met by existing therapies 
linaclotide is our only product candidate that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept 
in august  we along with forest submitted an nda  with the fda  for linaclotide for the treatment of ibs c and cc 
in october  the fda accepted the nda for review  and the fda pdufa target action date is expected to occur in june in february  we were informed that the fda will not schedule an advisory committee meeting in connection with its review of our nda 
in addition to linaclotide  we have a pipeline of early development candidates in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  cns disorders and respiratory disease 
we are also conducting discovery research in these therapeutic areas  as well as in the area of cardiovascular disease 
we have pursued a partnering strategy for commercializing linaclotide that has enabled us to retain significant control over linaclotide s development and commercialization  share the costs with high quality collaborators whose capabilities complement ours  and retain approximately half of linaclotide s future long term value in the major pharmaceutical markets  should linaclotide meet our sales expectations 
we were incorporated in delaware as microbia  inc which was the name of our formerly majority owned subsidiary  on january  on april   we changed our name to ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc prior to september  we held a majority ownership interest in microbia  inc formerly known as microbia precision engineering  a subsidiary formed in september microbia  inc  or 
table of contents microbia  engaged in a specialty biochemicals business based on a proprietary strain development platform 
on september   we sold our interest in microbia to dsm holding company usa  inc  or dsm  in exchange for cash proceeds of million  the payment of approximately million of microbia debt and interest by dsm and future contingent consideration based on the sale of products incorporating microbia s technology 
we currently operate in one reportable business segment human therapeutics 
our human therapeutics segment consists of the development and commercialization of our product candidates  including linaclotide 
prior to the sale of our interest in microbia  we also operated in the biomanufacturing segment 
our biomanufacturing segment  which comprised a much smaller part of our business  consisted of our majority ownership interest in microbia 
our human therapeutics segment represented of our total assets at december  and for the years ended december  and  results of operations of our biomanufacturing segment are included in net income loss from discontinued operations in our financial statements 
to date  we have dedicated substantially all of our activities to the research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue to date from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in we incurred net losses attributable to ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc of approximately million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
in february  we sold  shares of our class a common stock through a firm commitment  underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share 
as a result of the offering  we received aggregate net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses  of approximately million 
we intend to use these proceeds for general corporate purposes  including to further strengthen our balance sheet in advance of the potential market launch of linaclotide if approved 
financial overview revenue 
revenue to date from our human therapeutics segment is generated primarily through our collaboration agreement with forest and our license agreements with almirall and astellas 
the terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include i licenses  ii research and development activities  and iii the manufacture of api and development materials for the collaborative partner 
payments to us may include one or more of the following nonrefundable license fees  payments for research and development activities  payments for the manufacture of api and development materials  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
revenue from our human therapeutics segment is shown in our consolidated statements of operations as collaborative arrangements revenue 
revenue from our biomanufacturing segment was generated by our former subsidiary  microbia  which had entered into research and development service agreements with various third parties 
these agreements generally provided for fees for research and development services rendered 
as a result of the sale of our interest in microbia  revenue from our biomanufacturing segment is included in net income loss from discontinued operations 
we expect our revenue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future as our collaborative arrangements revenue is principally based on the achievement of clinical and commercial milestones 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses  research and development related facility costs and third party contract costs relating to research  formulation  manufacturing  preclinical study and clinical trial activities 
the costs of revenue related to the 
table of contents microbia services contracts and costs associated with microbia s research and development activities are included in net income loss from discontinued operations 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
under our forest collaboration agreement we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred 
our lead product candidate is linaclotide and it represents the largest portion of our research and development expense for our product candidates 
linaclotide is a first in class compound being developed for the treatment of ibs c and cc and is our only product candidate that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept 
linaclotide achieved positive results in each of our two phase ibs c trials and in each of our two phase cc trials 
an nda for linaclotide with respect to both ibs c and cc was submitted to the fda and accepted for review in october  and the pdufa target action date is expected to occur in june additionally  an maa for linaclotide for ibs c was submitted to the ema by almirall in september we have a pipeline of early development candidates in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  cns disorders and respiratory disease 
we are also conducting discovery research in these therapeutic areas  as well as in the area of cardiovascular disease 
the following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years ended december   and these expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with manufacturing  including supply chain development  preclinical studies and clinical trial costs 
costs related to facilities  depreciation  share based compensation and research and development support services are not directly charged to programs 
years ended december  unaudited in thousands demonstrated clinical proof of concept early development candidates discovery research we began tracking program expenses for linaclotide in  and research and development program expenses from inception to december  were approximately million 
the expenses for linaclotide include both reimbursements to us by forest as well as our portion of costs incurred by forest for linaclotide and invoiced to us under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide or our other product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate precisely when  if ever  linaclotide  or any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we invest carefully in our pipeline  and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear  supportive data 
in addition  we are actively engaged in evaluating externally discovered drug candidates at all stages of development 
in evaluating potential assets  we apply the same criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets 

table of contents the majority of our external costs are spent on linaclotide  as costs associated with later stage clinical trials are  in most cases  more significant than those incurred in earlier stages of our pipeline 
we expect external costs related to the linaclotide program to begin decreasing provided that no other clinical trials are necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the us if our other product candidates are successful in early stage clinical trials  we would expect external costs to increase as the programs progress through later stage clinical trials 
the remainder of our research and development expense is not tracked by project as it consists primarily of our internal costs  and it benefits multiple projects that are in earlier stages of development and which typically share resources 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including  but not limited to the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict 
the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable 
the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future preclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical data of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of such product candidate s commercial potential 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future and to increase with respect to our product candidates other than linaclotide as we advance those product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials 
additionally  our research and development costs will increase as we will fund full time equivalents for research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements that are not related to linaclotide 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses for personnel in our administrative  finance  legal  information technology  business development  commercial and human resource functions 
other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  general and administrative related facility costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services 
we anticipate substantial increases in expenses related to developing the organization necessary to commercialize linaclotide 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses and share based compensation are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
these critical estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development and license agreements 
the terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include i licenses  ii research and development activities  and iii the manufacture of api and development materials for the collaborative partner 
payments to us under these agreements may include non refundable license fees  payments for research and development activities  payments for the manufacture of api and development materials  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
in addition  prior to september  we generated services revenue through agreements that generally provided for fees for research and development services rendered 
we evaluate revenue from agreements that have multiple elements under the guidance of accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which we adopted in january we identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting 
we account for those components as separate elements when the following criteria are met the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and within our control 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
the determination that multiple elements in an arrangement meet the criteria for separate units of accounting requires us to exercise our judgment 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the determination of whether we should recognize revenue on a gross or net basis involves judgment based on the relevant facts and circumstances  which relate primarily to whether we act as a 
table of contents principal or agent in the process of generating revenues from our collaboration and licensing arrangements 
for certain of our arrangements  particularly our license agreement with almirall  it is required that taxes be withheld on payments to us 
we have adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of these tax withholdings 
up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration and license agreements  including the million up front license fee under the forest collaboration agreement entered into in september and the million up front license fee  of which million was received net of foreign withholding taxes  under the almirall license agreement entered into in april  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance due to our continued involvement in research and development 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur 
as a result  we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant to a collaboration or license agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration and license agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach has resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance may change in the future 
any change in our estimates could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues from an up front license fee are recognized 
in june  we revised our estimate of the development period associated with our almirall license agreement from months to months and adjusted the amortization of the remaining deferred revenue accordingly 
aside from this change  we have had no other material changes to our estimated periods of continuing involvement under existing collaboration and license agreements 
milestones at the inception of each arrangement that includes contingent milestone payments  the company evaluates whether each milestone is substantive 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  clinical  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
substantive milestones are due to us upon nda approval of linaclotide in the us  upon the initiation of a phase study for linaclotide in japan  upon the filing and approval of the japanese equivalent of an nda with the relevant regulatory authority in japan 
on january   we adopted asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  or asu refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k for additional discussion of the adoption of this standard and its impact on our accounting for collaboration and license agreements 
as a result of this adoption  in those circumstances where a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 

table of contents prior to january   in those circumstances where a substantive milestone was achieved  collection of the related receivable was reasonably assured and we had remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement  we recognized as revenue on the date the milestone was achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance 
milestone payments received prior to the adoption of asu under the forest collaboration and almirall license agreement will continue to be recognized based upon this method 
if we do not consider a milestone to be substantive  the revenues from the related milestone payment cannot be recognized when the milestone is achieved  but must be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
all of the milestones that have been achieved to date under our forest collaboration agreement and our almirall license agreement were substantive 
as of december   we had not achieved any milestones under our astellas license agreement 
payments received or reasonably assured after performance obligations are fully met are recognized as earned 
because the recognition of a substantive milestone under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
when we do achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our collaborations  we may experience significant fluctuations in our collaborative revenues from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones 
research and development expense all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses comprise costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including compensation  benefits and other employee costs  share based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  and other external expenses 
in addition  research and development expense includes reimbursements from forest for services performed pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  project management costs  and investigator fees 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
under our forest collaboration agreement  we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred 
nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities are capitalized and expensed over the related service period or as goods are received 
share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january   based on the grant date fair value 
these costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for all time based vested awards 
we record the expense of services rendered by non employees based on the estimated fair value of the stock option using the black scholes option pricing model as of the respective vesting date 
further  
table of contents we expense the fair value of non employee stock options over the vesting term of the underlying stock options 
for employee share based awards  we estimate the fair value of the share based awards  including stock options  using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards granted in  and are set forth below years ended december  volatility dividend yield expected life of options in years risk free interest rate the assumptions used in determining the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change  and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation could be materially different in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a zero coupon us treasury instrument with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the share based award 
because we do not have a sufficient history to estimate the expected term  we use the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
the simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  we lacked company specific historical and implied volatility information 
therefore  we use a blended volatility rate using our own historical volatility and that of publicly traded peer companies 
for purposes of identifying publicly traded peer companies  we selected publicly traded companies that are in the biopharmaceutical industry  have products or product candidates in similar therapeutic areas gastrointestinal dysfunction and pain management and stages of preclinical and clinical development as us  have sufficient trading history to derive a historic volatility rate and have similar vesting terms as our granted options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we also recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
accordingly  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical forfeiture rate  adjusted for known trends  and used these rates in developing a future forfeiture rate 
our forfeiture rates were  and as of december   and  respectively 
if our actual forfeiture rate varies from our historical rates and estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
prior to our public offering  we granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock as determined by our board of directors  with input from management 
due to the absence of an active market for our common stock  prior to our initial public offering on february   our board of directors had historically determined  with input from management  the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of objective and subjective factors  including the prices at which we sold shares of convertible preferred stock  the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time of each grant  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale of our company  
table of contents our historical operating and financial performance and the status of our research and product development efforts  achievement of enterprise milestones  including our entering into collaboration and license agreements  and external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector 
in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   our board of directors also considered valuations provided by management in determining the fair value of our common stock 
such valuations were prepared as of march  june  september  november and december   and valued our common stock at    and per share  respectively 
the valuations were used to estimate the fair value of our common stock as of each option grant date and in calculating share based compensation expense 
our board of directors had consistently used the most recent quarterly valuation provided by management for determining the fair value of our common stock unless a specific event occurred that necessitated an interim valuation 
the valuations were prepared consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  or the practice aid 
we used the guideline company method and the similar transaction method of the market approach  which compare our company to similar publicly traded companies or transactions  and an income approach  which looks at projected future cash flows  to value our company from among the alternatives discussed in the practice aid 
we used the probability weighted expected return method described in the practice aid to allocate the enterprise values to the common stock 
there are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of these valuations 
these judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future performance  the time to completing an ipo or other liquidity event  and the timing of and probability of launching our product candidate as well as determinations of the appropriate valuation methods 
if we had made different assumptions  our share based compensation expense  net loss and net loss per share could have been significantly different 
we have also granted performance based stock options with terms that allow the recipients to vest in a specific number of shares based upon the achievement of performance based milestones as specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these performance based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management s best estimates of the time to vesting for the achievement of the performance based milestones 
if the actual achievement of the performance based milestones varies from our estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially different than what is recorded in the period 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated time to vesting for performance based stock options will be recognized as compensation cost in the period of the revision  and recorded as a change in estimate 
we have also granted time accelerated stock options with terms that allow the acceleration in vesting of the stock options upon the achievement of performance based milestones specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these time accelerated stock options is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards or the implied service period  if shorter 
while the assumptions used to calculate and account for share based compensation awards represents management s best estimates  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if revisions are made to our underlying assumptions and estimates  our share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period 

table of contents as of december   there was approximately million and million of unrecognized share based compensation  net of estimated forfeitures  related to restricted stock awards and unvested stock option grants with time based vesting  respectively which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
the total unrecognized share based compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
additionally  at december   approximately million of additional share based compensation related to options subject to performance based milestone vesting was not yet recognized 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements located in this annual report on form k for further discussion of share based compensation

table of contents collaborative arrangements 
the increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in revenue from the achievement of the million ibs c nda acceptance milestone and the achievement of the million cc nda acceptance milestone in our forest collaboration 
in accordance with asu  which we adopted in january  we recognized these substantive milestones in their entirety upon their achievement 
such milestones were achieved in connection with the fda s acceptance of our nda for review in october other changes in revenue were mostly related to the almirall license agreement 
in june  we revised our estimate of the development period associated with the almirall license agreement which resulted in approximately million in additional revenue recognized in this amount is partially offset by the revenue recognized upon achievement of the phase milestone in november the revenue from this milestone was recorded pre adoption of asu and resulted in the recognition of approximately million more in revenue during than in operating expenses years ended december  change dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits  and employee related expenses associated mainly with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock option grant made in february  an increase of approximately million in external research costs related to the research and development fees paid in connection with our licensing agreements that are not related to linaclotide  offset by a decrease of approximately million in support of linaclotide  primarily resulting from lower clinical trial and collaboration expenses as we completed the efficacy portion of linaclotide s development program 
general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses associated with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock option grant made in february  an increase of approximately million in general and administrative related facilities costs primarily due to increased depreciation expense associated with the amortization of leasehold improvements at our binney street facility and improvements in our it infrastructure  an increase in external consulting costs of approximately million primarily associated with developing the infrastructure to commercialize and support linaclotide and an increase of approximately million in the net expense from forest on our collaborative commercial activities 

table of contents other income expense  net years ended december  change dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense interest and investment income other income total other income expense  net interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a reduction in long term debt associated with the payment of all the long term debt in september interest and investment income 
the decrease in interest and investment income of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
other income 
the decrease in other income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the timing of tax incentives or awards we received 
in  we recognized a life sciences tax incentive program award of approximately million from the massachusetts life sciences center 
in  we recognized approximately million in federal grants awarded to us under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
income tax benefit expense 
the approximately million decrease in income tax benefit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is related to intra period income tax allocation requirements in for which we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of approximately million  offset by an identical income tax provision from discontinued operations for the year ended december  the intra period income tax allocation considers discontinued operations for purposes of determining the amount of tax benefit that results from our loss from continuing operations 
there was no corresponding tax allocation in net income loss from discontinued operations 
the income from discontinued operations in is associated with the approximately million gain recognized on the sale of microbia  partially offset by the tax provision related to the intra period tax allocation 
as a result of the sale of microbia in september  there were no discontinued operations in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the approximately million in net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december  was attributable to amounts recognized by microbia immediately prior to the sale of microbia in september as a result of the sale of microbia in september  there was no corresponding income in 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue years ended december  change dollars in thousands collaborative arrangements revenue collaborative arrangements 
the increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in revenue from the almirall license agreement  which we entered into in april  and the astellas license agreement  which we entered into in november  offset by decreases in revenue from the forest collaboration 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of revenue  compared with approximately million of revenue in  related to the million up front license payment received in may from almirall and the amortization of the deferred revenue resulting from recording the initial million valuation of the almirall forward purchase contract

the decrease in the remeasurement of forward purchase contracts of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from the final settlement of the forest forward purchase contract in july and the almirall forward purchase contract in november the forest forward purchase contract was remeasured in july when forest made its equity investment and the almirall forward purchase contract was remeasured at november  when almirall made its equity investment  resulting in total respective gains on remeasurement of million and million for the year ended december  as a result of the final settlements of both forward purchase contracts  there were no corresponding remeasurements during 
table of contents other income 
the increase in other income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to approximately  in grants awarded to us under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program in there was no corresponding award in income tax benefit expense 
the approximately million increase in income tax benefit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was related to intra period income tax allocation requirements for which we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of approximately million  offset by an identical income tax provision from discontinued operations for the year ended december  the intra period income tax allocation considers discontinued operations for purposes of determining the amount of tax benefit that results from our loss from continuing operations 
net income loss from discontinued operations 
the approximately million increase in net income loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of the approximately million gain recognized on the sale of microbia in september and lower operating expenses of microbia resulting from reduced headcount and rent expense associated with microbia s november restructuring activities  partially offset by the tax provision related to the intra period tax allocation 
net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the approximately million increase in net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in net income for microbia due to a gain recognized on the settlement of intercompany balances immediately prior to the sale of microbia in september and lower operating expenses of microbia resulting from reduced headcount and rent expense associated with microbia s november restructuring activities

funding requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products and have not achieved profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we further develop and prepare for the potential commercial launch of linaclotide  continue to invest in our pipeline  develop the organization required to sell our product candidates and operate as a publicly traded company 
we have generated revenue from services  up front license fees and milestones  but have not generated any product revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any product revenue from our collaborative arrangements or the sale of products unless we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale of linaclotide 
we believe that our cash on hand as of the date of this annual report on form k  additional cash milestone payments we may receive from our current or future collaborators  and cash received from our recent equity offering provides significant optionality and will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs through the anticipated commercialization of linaclotide 
if our forecasted operating needs change  we may require additional funding in the form of public or private equity or debt offerings or a credit facility  or we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our commercialization efforts 
in addition  if favorable opportunities arise to further strengthen our balance sheet  we may take advantage of one or more of the previously mentioned funding alternatives at that time 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  including the underlying estimates regarding the costs to obtain regulatory approval and the costs to commercialize linaclotide  is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and 
table of contents actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of  and to obtain regulatory approval for  linaclotide and our other product candidates for all of the indications for which we believe each product candidate is suited 
our funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the expenses we incur in marketing and selling our product candidates  the revenue generated by sales of our product candidates  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms and timing of any additional collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies 
contractual commitments and obligations under our collaborative agreement with forest  we share equally with forest all development and commercialization costs related to linaclotide in the us the actual amounts that we pay forest or that forest pays to us will depend on numerous factors outside of our control  including the success of our clinical development efforts with respect to linaclotide  the content and timing of decisions made by the fda  the reimbursement and competitive landscape around linaclotide and our other product candidates  and other factors described under the heading risk factors 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
the contracts with cros generally are cancellable  with notice  at our option and do not have any cancellation penalties 
these items are not included in the table below 
in connection with our collaboration agreement with bionomics limited  or bionomics  entered into in january  we are obligated to make an up front payment to bionomics of million 
we will also fund full time equivalents for drug discovery activities performed by bionomics  as well as those associated with our other collaboration agreements that are not related to linaclotide 
due to the uncertainties involved in the discovery phase of a product candidate  we are unable to determine the duration and costs required to complete these drug discovery activities and as a result  we have not included these amounts in the table below 
pending the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones in each of the agreements  we will make certain milestone and royalty payments 
as these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts and as a result  these contingent payments have not been included in the table below 

table of contents as of december   we have multiple commercial supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations for the purchase of a portion of the linaclotide api and drug product that will be used to seek regulatory approval of linaclotide in north america and the eu  and  depending on such approval  that would be used for commercial sales in such countries 
the table below reflects our minimum purchase requirements under these commercial supply agreements  as well as any outstanding non cancellable purchase orders 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  excluding interest payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands commercial supply obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations our commitment for capital lease obligations relates to leased computer and office equipment 
our commitments for operating leases relate to our lease of office and laboratory space in cambridge  massachusetts and our data collocation space in boston 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item a ii of regulation s k or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 
we enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries 
new accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
recently adopted accounting standards in october  the fasb issued asu asu amended existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb accounting standards codification subtopic previously included within eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the consensus to asu provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
eitf previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between 
table of contents unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
under eitf  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  on january   we adopted asu on a prospective basis 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued asu asu provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements 
under this guidance  management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety  in the period in which the milestone is achieved  only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
this asu is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june  on january   we adopted asu to change our accounting policy to begin applying the milestone method on a prospective basis 
as we elected prospective adoption  there was no material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized two milestone payments for a total of million in revenue due to substantive milestones achieved after asu was adopted 
the adoption resulted in approximately million per share of additional revenue recognized in upon the achievement of the milestones as compared to recognition under our prior milestone accounting policy 
our prior milestone accounting policy recorded as revenue the portion of the milestone payment equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers  or asu  which provides guidance on how to recognize and classify the fees mandated by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  together the acts 
the acts impose an annual fee for each calendar year beginning on or after january  payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs 
the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation over the calendar year that it is payable 
asu is effective for calendar years beginning on or after december   when the fee initially becomes effective 
on january   we adopted asu on a prospective basis 
as we do not currently have a commercial product  the effect of this guidance will be limited to future transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  or asu asu amends asc  fair value measurement  to ensure that fair value has the same meaning in gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs 
ifrs and improves the comparability of the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and ifrs 
asu applies to all entities that measure assets  liabilities or instruments classified in shareholder s equity at fair value  or provide fair value disclosures for items not recorded at fair value 
asu results in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
consequently  asu changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
for many of the requirements  asu will not result in a change in the application of the requirements in asc some of the requirements in asu clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value 
table of contents measurement requirements 
other requirements change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
asu is effective for public companies for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and should be applied prospectively 
early application is not permitted 
we intend to adopt this standard beginning in we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that our adoption of asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  or asu  which is intended to facilitate the convergence of us gaap and ifrs as well as to increase the transparency of items reported in other comprehensive income 
as a result of asu  all nonowner changes in stockholders equity are required to be presented in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated 
asu is effective for public companies for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and should be applied retrospectively 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 or asu  which defers the effective date of the provisions of asu pertaining to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
all other requirements in asu are not affected by asu asu is effective for public companies for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we intend to adopt these standards beginning in as asu and asu impact presentation only  they will have no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally deposits  securities issued by the us government and its agencies and money market instruments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed and auction rate securities and the resulting effect on various securities markets 
we do not currently have any auction rate securities 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits 

table of contents our capital lease obligations bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have no operations outside the us and do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation and changing prices over the years ended december   and had a significant impact on our results of operations
