avrl 
during fiscal  we began developing avrl  a full service laboratory testing facility  based in olathe  kansas 
in october  we began providing veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians in the united states through avrl 
avrl also focuses on providing specialty and esoteric testing and analysis 
this service complements our full suite of on site laboratory instrumentation and rapid diagnostics for in hospital routine  critical care and emergency medicine laboratory needs 
factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty  and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control  including but not limited to inventory or timing considerations by our distributors 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result  any such revenues shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our piccolo and vetscan products and to achieve profitability in avrl and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 

table of contents we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
service revenues are primarily generated from veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians 
revenues from product sales and services  net of estimated sales allowances  discounts and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products or rendering of services to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
from time to time  we offer discounts on avrl services for a specified period as incentives 
discounts are reductions to invoiced amounts within a specified period and are recorded at the time services are performed 
net service revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current deferred revenue liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
multiple element revenue arrangements 
on april   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  an amendment to accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition asu 
we elected to apply the amendment prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements after its effective date 
the fasb amended the accounting standards for certain multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
a multiple element arrangement includes the sale of one or more tangible product offerings with one or more associated services offerings  each of which are individually considered separate units of accounting 
the determination of our units of accounting did not change with the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance and as such we allocate revenues to each element in a multiple element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows for fiscal our sales arrangements contain multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of instruments  consumables or extended maintenance agreements 
additionally  we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
pursuant to the guidance of asu  revenues from such sales are allocated separately to the instruments  consumables  extended maintenance agreements and incentives based on the relative selling price method 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
revenues allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria  as described above  is met for each element 
revenues associated with incentives in the form of free goods are deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer 
revenues associated with incentives in the form of extended maintenance agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
incentives in the form of extended maintenance agreements are our most significant multiple element arrangement 
starting in fiscal  we participate in selling arrangements in the veterinary market that include multiple deliverables  such as instruments  consumables and service agreements associated with our veterinary reference laboratory 
under these arrangements  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the product or performance of the service during the term of the service contract when the basic revenue recognition criteria  as described above  is met for each element 
we allocate revenues to each element based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
in fiscal  we offered customer incentives comprising of arrangements with customers to include discounts on future sales of services associated with our veterinary reference laboratory 
we apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental 
when the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental  we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement 
to determine whether a discount is significant and incremental  we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product to similar customers  the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement  and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement 
if the discount in the multiple element arrangement approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales  that discount is not considered incremental 
during fiscal our customer incentive programs with future discounts were not significant 

table of contents at march   and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances was million   and million  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances was million  million and million  respectively 
the total increase in deferred revenue balances as of march  is primarily due to an increase in maintenance contracts offered to customers from time to time in the form of free services in connection with the sale of our products  partially offset by deferred revenue recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
customer programs 
from time to time  we offer customer marketing and incentive programs 
our most significant customer programs are described as follows instrument trade in programs 
we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded based on the relative selling price method according to the policies described above 
instrument rental programs 
we periodically offer programs to customers whereby certain instruments are made available to customers for rent or on an evaluation basis 
these programs typically require customers to purchase a minimum quantity of consumables during a specified period for which we recognize revenues on the related consumables according to the policies described above 
depending on the program offered  customers may purchase the instrument during the rental or evaluation period 
proceeds from such sale are recorded as revenues according to the policies described above 
rental income  if any  are also recorded as revenue according to the policies described above 
distributor and customer rebate programs 
we periodically offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives  such as cash rebates  from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period and are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during a qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to distributors or customers who purchase certain products or instruments during a promotional period and are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of veterinary products during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to nine months after sale 
changes in the rebate accrual at each fiscal year end are based upon distributors meeting the purchase requirements during the quarter 
other rebate programs offered to distributors or customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
the following table summarizes the change in total accrued distributor and customer rebates in thousands balance at beginning balance at of year provisions payments end of year year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  royalty revenues 
royalties are typically based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the licensee 
our royalty revenue depends on the licensees use of our technology  and therefore  may vary from period to period and impact our revenues during a quarter 
as a result of the license termination with cepheid during fiscal  our development and licensing revenue was adversely and materially impacted in our consolidated financial statements during fiscal and also  we expect the license termination will adversely and materially impact development and licensing revenue in our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 

table of contents fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
as of march   our investments in cash equivalents  which we classified as available for sale  totaled million  using level inputs since these investments are traded in an active market 
the valuations are based on quoted prices of the underlying security that are readily and regularly available in an active market  and accordingly  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data  including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active 
level also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models  such as interest rates and volatility factors  are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
as of march   our available for sale investments in certificates of deposits  corporate bonds and municipal bonds  totaled million  using level inputs  based on market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities obtained from various third party data providers 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
at march   we also had million in investments classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
in february  we purchased a equity ownership interest in smb  for million in cash 
we use the equity method to account for our investment in this entity that we do not control  but where we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
equity method investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses after the date of investment  additional contributions made and dividends or distributions received  and impairment losses resulting from adjustments to net realizable value 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
we record our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses in interest and other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
at march   our investment in unconsolidated affiliate totaled million 
we assess the potential impairment of our equity method investments when indicators such as a history of operating losses  a negative earnings and cash flow outlook  and the financial condition and prospects for the investee s business segment might indicate a loss in value 
we did not recognize any impairment loss on investment in unconsolidated affiliate during fiscal and warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation on instruments ranges from one to three years  depending on the type of product 
the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenues are recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
cost of revenues reflects estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period and any adjustments in estimated warranty expense for the installed base under our standard warranty obligation based on our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on our historical experience as to product failures  estimated product failure rates  estimated repair costs  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes under the warranty plan 
a provision for defective reagent discs is recorded when the related sale is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of revenues 
the warranty cost includes the replacement costs and freight of a defective reagent disc 

table of contents as of march   our current portion of warranty reserves for instruments and reagent discs totaled million and our non current portion of warranty reserves for instruments totaled  which reflects our estimate of warranty obligations based on the estimated product failure rates  the number of instruments in standard warranty  estimated repair and related costs of instruments  and an estimate of defective reagent discs and replacement and related costs of a defective reagent disc 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate of warranty reserves  including our assumptions 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional accrual to pre existing warranties of  which increased our warranty reserves and our cost of revenues  based on both historical and projected product performance rates of instruments 
for fiscal  and  the provision for warranty expense related to instruments was million   and  respectively 
the increase in the provision related to instruments during fiscal was primarily attributed to a change in our standard warranty period and an increase in the number of instruments under standard warranty 
management periodically evaluates the sufficiency of the warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary 
if an unusual performance rate related to warranty claims is noted  an additional warranty accrual may be assessed and recorded when a failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we review the historical warranty cost trends and analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance of warranty reserves each quarter 
the determination of warranty reserves requires us to make estimates of the estimated product failure rate  expected costs to repair or replace the instruments and to replace defective reagent discs under warranty 
if actual repair or replacement costs of instruments or replacement costs of reagent discs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
additionally  if factors change and we revise our assumptions on the product failure rate of instruments or reagent discs  then our warranty reserves and cost of revenues could be materially impacted in the quarter of such revision  as well as in following quarters 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximate actual costs using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortized intangible assets  whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long lived assets indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value and long lived assets are written down to their respective fair values 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be recovered 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
at march  and  we had no significant uncertain tax positions 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  and  we did not recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of income  and at march  and  we had no accrued interest or penalties 
share based compensation expense 
we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
we have not granted any stock options since the beginning of fiscal and we did not grant stock options during fiscal  or for stock options granted prior to march   we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires highly subjective assumptions  including risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  expected term and expected dividends 

table of contents for restricted stock units  share based compensation expense is based on the fair value of our stock at the grant date and recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as required by fair value provisions of share based compensation  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated over the requisite service period of the awards and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based compensation awards that are granted and cancelled prior to vesting and upon historical experience of employee turnover 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
share based compensation expense resulted in a material impact on our earnings per share and on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal  and the impact of share based compensation expense on our consolidated financial results is disclosed in note  share based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as of march   our unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted to employees and directors to date totaled million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
we expect that share based compensation will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
excluding forfeitures  we estimate expense recognition of restricted stock units over the requisite service period of the award  for awards granted and unvested as of march  as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal results of operations total revenues revenues by geographic region and by product and service category 
revenues by geographic region based on customer location and revenues by product and service category during fiscal  and were as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended march  change to change to revenues by geographic region increase decrease percent change increase decrease percent change north america percentage of total revenues europe percentage of total revenues asia pacific and rest of the world percentage of total revenues total revenues year ended march  change to change to revenues by product and service category increase decrease percent change increase decrease percent change instruments percentage of total revenues consumables percentage of total revenues other products and services percentage of total revenues product and service revenues  net percentage of total revenues development and licensing revenues percentage of total revenues total revenues instruments include chemistry analyzers  hematology instruments  vspro coagulation and specialty analyzers and i stat analyzers

viii total warranty reserves increased by  resulting from an increase in the current portion of warranty reserves of  from million at march  to million as of march  and an increase in the non current portion of warranty reserves of  from  at march  to  as of march  the increase in warranty reserves is primarily based on a the number of instruments in standard warranty  estimated product failure rates and estimated repair costs and b an estimate of defective reagent discs and replacement costs 
the increase in warranty reserves balances is due to a change in our standard warranty period and an increase in the number of instruments under standard warranty 
management periodically evaluates the sufficiency of the warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary 
if an unusual performance rate related to warranty claims is noted  an additional warranty accrual may be assessed and recorded when a failure event is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we anticipate that we will incur incremental additional costs to support our future operations  including further additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products  research and design costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  acquisition of capital equipment for our manufacturing facility and costs to operate avrl 
furthermore  during fiscal  we incurred legal costs related to a a patent infringement lawsuit against cepheid with respect to cepheid s methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa product  on which cepheid has ceased paying license royalties and b compliance in an investigation by the united states federal trade commission of a competitor

as of march   million of our common stock may yet be purchased under such authorization 
the repurchases are made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
repurchased shares are retired 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares for million  including commissions  at an average per share cost of 
financial condition we believe that cash and cash equivalents  investments and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and share repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will largely depend upon the increased market acceptance of our point of care blood analyzer products and of our abaxis veterinary reference laboratories 
however  our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty

operating lease obligations were comprised of our principal facility and various leased facilities and office equipment under operating lease agreements  which expire on various dates from fiscal through fiscal our principal facilities located in union city  california is under a non cancelable operating lease agreement  which expires in fiscal purchase commitments 
in october  we entered into an oem agreement with smb of denmark to purchase coagulation and specialty analyzers and related cartridges 
effective january  we amended and restated our oem agreement  including the terms of our minimum purchase commitments 
under the amended agreement  we committed to purchase a minimum number of coagulation and specialty analyzers and related cartridges on an annual basis during each calendar year through our purchase obligations in the future may be adjusted if our minimum purchase commitments are not met during a calendar year period 
at march   our total remaining outstanding commitment due is approximately million 
in december  we executed a term sheet to enter into a development and supply equipment agreement with diatron of hungary to purchase diatron hematology instruments 
under the terms of this agreement  we committed to purchase a minimum number of hematology instruments on an annual basis during each calendar year through  which can be amended upon agreement by both parties 
at march   our outstanding commitment due is approximately million 
at march   we prepaid million to diatron for future purchases of hematology instruments and reagents  which was recorded in prepaid expenses and other currents assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
the commitment amount is based on the minimum number of hematology instruments that we are required to purchase  the cost of the instruments and the euro exchange rate at period end 
since the exchange rate can fluctuate in the future  the commitment in absolute dollars will change accordingly 
notes payable 
we have a ten year loan agreement with the community redevelopment agency of the city of union city the agency whereby the agency provides us with an unsecured loan of up to million  primarily to purchase capital equipment 
the loan was effective january  bears interest at and is payable quarterly 
as of march   our short term and long term notes payable balances were  and  respectively  and we recorded the short term balance in other accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the entire outstanding balance of the note shall be payable in full on the earlier of i december  or ii the date abaxis ceases operations in union city  california 
the agency also has the right to accelerate the maturity date and declare all balances immediately due and payable upon the event of default as defined in the loan agreement 
we evaluate covenants in our loan agreement on a quarterly basis  and we were in compliance with such covenants as of march  in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  the agency will provide abaxis with an annual credit that can be applied against the accrued interest and outstanding principal balance on a quarterly basis 
the agency determines the annual credit based on certain taxes paid by abaxis to the city of union city  california for a specified period  as defined in the loan agreement 
we anticipate that our annual credits from the agency will be used to fully repay our notes payable due to the agency 
we may carry forward unused quarterly credits to apply against our outstanding balance in a future period 
credits applied to repay our notes payable and accrued interest are recorded in interest and other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
patent licensing agreement 
effective january  we entered into a license agreement with alere 
under our license agreement  we licensed co exclusively certain worldwide patent rights related to lateral flow immunoassay technology in the field of animal health diagnostics in the professional marketplace 
the license agreement provides that alere shall not grant any future rights to any third parties under its current lateral flow patent rights in the animal health diagnostics field in the professional marketplace 
the license agreement enables us to develop and market products under rights from alere to address animal health and laboratory animal research markets 
in exchange for the license rights  we i paid an up front license fee of million to alere in january  ii agreed to pay royalties during the term of the agreement  based solely on sales of products in a jurisdiction country covered by valid and unexpired claims in that jurisdiction under the licensed alere patent rights  and iii agreed to pay a yearly minimum license fee of between  to million per year  which fee will be creditable against any royalties due during such calendar year 
the royalties  if any  are payable through the date of the expiration of the last valid patent licensed under the agreement that includes at least one claim in a jurisdiction covering products we sell in that jurisdiction 
the yearly minimum fees became payable starting in fiscal for so long as we desire to maintain exclusivity under the agreement 
contingencies on june   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against cepheid with respect to cepheid s methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa product  on which cepheid has ceased paying license royalties 
on december   cepheid filed its amended answer and certain counterclaims seeking findings of no breach of contract  non infringement  unenforceability and invalidity of the asserted patents  and a declaration regarding the patent term of one of the patents 
we believe the counterclaims raised by cepheid are without merit and intend to contest them vigorously 
because of the cost involved in pursuing patent infringement cases  we believe the cost of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on abaxis  our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
as of march   we had not recorded future litigation and related expenses to pursuing the patent infringement case and an estimate of such costs cannot be made at this time 
a claims construction hearing was held in june and the court has issued its claims construction order 
the case is ongoing 
a trial date has been set for september  
table of contents we are involved from time to time in various litigation matters in the normal course of business
