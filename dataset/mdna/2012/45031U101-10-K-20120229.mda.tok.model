we reclassified certain items in our consolidated financial statements of prior years to conform to our current year s presentation 
introduction istar financial inc is a fully integrated finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry 
we provide custom tailored investment capital to high end private and corporate owners of real estate and invest directly across a range of real estate sectors 
we are taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  and have invested more than billion over the past two decades 
our primary business segments are lending  net leasing and real estate investment 
the lending portfolio is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from million to million and have original terms generally ranging from three to ten years 
these loans may be either fixed rate based on the us treasury rate plus a spread or variable rate based on libor plus a spread and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers 
our portfolio also includes senior and subordinated loans to corporations  particularly those engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses 
these financings may be either secured or unsecured  typically range in size from million to million and have initial maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
our loan portfolio includes whole loans  loan participations and debt securities 
our net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by us and leased to single creditworthy tenants  where the properties are generally mission critical headquarters or distribution facilities that are subject to long term leases 
most of the leases provide for expenses at the facility to be paid by the tenant on a triple net lease basis 
net lease transactions have initial terms generally ranging from to years and typically range in size from million to million 
our real estate investment portfolio includes real estate held for investment rehi and other real estate owned oreo properties primarily acquired through foreclosure or through deed in lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non performing loans 
through the infusion of capital and or intensive asset management  we generally seek to reposition and redevelop these assets with the objective 
table of contents of maximizing their value 
we have developed significant expertise in the ownership and repositioning of multifamily  condominium  master planned and development properties 
our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that corporate customers pay to lease our properties 
we primarily generate income through the spread or margin  which is the difference between the revenues generated from loans and leases and interest expense and the cost of net lease operations 
going forward  we also expect to earn income from our other real estate investments 
income from real estate investments may include operating revenues as well as income from sales of properties either in bulk or through unit sales 
this income will be reduced by holding costs while the real estate investments are redeveloped  repositioned and eventually sold 
executive overview the recent economic recession adversely affected our business  resulting in significant provisions for loan losses and impairments  increasing amounts of non performing loans  higher financing costs and an inability to access the unsecured debt markets 
during the recession and continuing through  we focused on resolving non performing assets  generating liquidity  retiring debt  decreasing leverage and preserving shareholder value 
in furtherance of these objectives  in we completed billion of secured debt refinancing transactions  which enabled us to meet our debt maturities and improve our debt maturity profile  though at a higher cost of capital 
in addition  we generated billion of liquidity from the portfolio and used the proceeds primarily to retire debt and reduce leverage 
we made meaningful progress in resolving problem assets  primarily evidenced by reductions in our non performing loans and a significantly lower provision for loan losses 
while we continue to incur significant costs repositioning and developing our oreo rehi assets  we believe that these investments should enhance the value of these assets and improve our ultimate returns 
additionally  we maintained book value per common share  which increased slightly from the prior year 
in the coming year we intend to continue to focus on preserving shareholder value by resolving non performing assets  strengthening the balance sheet through reduced leverage and better alignment of our asset and liability profile  and investing in our oreo rehi portfolio 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million 
although this was a decrease from million of net income in  the results in included million in gains primarily related to the sale of a large net lease asset portfolio as compared to million of such gains in the current year 
the provision for loan losses decreased to million in from million in  which resulted primarily from a reduction in non performing loans 
our results also benefited from a million increase in income from equity method investments  due primarily to the sale of our interest in oak hill advisors and a full year of earnings from our investment in lnr  and the redemption of a series of senior secured notes  which resulted in a one time gain of million 
during the year  non performing loans decreased to million as of december   compared to billion at december  in some cases these loans were sold or modified and in many cases we took possession of properties serving as collateral for these loans through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
these foreclosed assets constitute the majority of our real estate investment portfolio  which has increased to billion as of december   from billion at the end of the overall increase in this portfolio was driven primarily by new rehi assets that we took title to during the year  offset by net reductions in oreo due to asset sales 
we generally seek to reposition and redevelop assets within this portfolio through the infusion of capital and or intensive asset management  with the objective of maximizing their value 
while we work on repositioning and redeveloping these assets  we expect to continue to incur significant costs 
these costs  net of rehi revenues  totaled million in and million in during the year ended december   we generated a total of billion in proceeds from our portfolio  comprised of billion in loan principal repayments and million from asset sales 
these proceeds were used in part to reduce our debt obligations by billion 
in march  we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility and used the proceeds to repay approximately 
table of contents billion of outstanding borrowings under our existing secured credit facilities  which were due to mature in june and june  and approximately million of unsecured debt 
additionally  we funded a total of million in new and pre existing investments 
the new investments we made in were primarily sourced from our existing portfolio 
we believe that making additional investments in assets within our portfolio may present more attractive risk adjusted return opportunities than are otherwise available in the market  due to our existing relationships with the customers and knowledge of the assets 
as of december   we had approximately billion of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before december  of this amount  million represents the minimum amortization payable by december  under the secured credit facility  which is collateralized by assets with a carrying value of billion 
we expect to use proceeds from repayments and sales of the pledged collateral to meet these amortization payments 
the remaining billion of maturities represent unsecured debt that is scheduled to mature during  including million in march  million in june and million in october 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash of million and other unencumbered assets with a carrying value of billion 
our capital sources to meet our unsecured debt maturities in the coming year will primarily include debt refinancings  proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments from borrowers  and may include equity capital raising transactions 
we believe that proceeds from these activities will be sufficient to meet our obligations during the remainder of the year  however  the timing and amounts of proceeds from expected asset repayments and sales  and our ability to consummate debt refinancing and equity capital raising transactions are subject to factors outside of our control and cannot be predicted with certainty 
as discussed further in liquidity and capital resources below  our plans are dynamic and we may adjust our plans in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions 
on february   we announced the launch of a syndication of up to million in new senior secured credit facilities 
we expect the facilities to be comprised of two tranches  maturing in and  with differing interest rates 
outstanding borrowings under the facilities will be collateralized by a pool of diversified collateral  including loans  net lease assets and other real estate assets 
the proceeds from the new credit facilities will be used to refinance our unsecured debt maturities 
we are in the process of syndicating the new facilities and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to complete the syndication 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs net lease assets operating costs rehi and oreo depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of assets other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt  net earnings from equity method investments income tax expense benefit income loss from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations income from sales of residential property net income loss 
table of contents revenue the decrease in interest income is primarily due to a decline in the average balance of performing loans to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  the decrease in performing loans was primarily due to loan repayments and sales as well as performing loans moving to non performing status see risk management below 
for the year ended december   performing loans generated a weighted average effective yield of as compared to in the decrease was partially offset by million of interest income recorded during the year ended december   related to certain non performing loans that were resolved  including interest not previously recorded due to the loans being on non accrual status 
within our other income  revenue from rehi assets increased to million in from million in due to additional rehi assets acquired during the last months 
during the year ended december   we received title to properties in full or partial satisfaction of non performing loans of which million were classified as rehi 
this increase in other income was almost entirely offset by lower loan prepayment fees received in the current year 
costs and expenses our total costs and expenses were impacted most significantly by lower provisions for loan losses 
the decline in our provisions for loan losses primarily resulted from fewer loans moving to non performing status and a lower overall balance of non performing loans during the year ended december  as compared to additionally  repayments and sales of performing loans resulted in a lower portfolio balance leading to a reduction in the required general loan loss reserve 
see risk management below 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and employee related costs from both staffing reductions and reduced annual cash compensation offset by additional stock based compensation expense resulting from the modification of our december  restricted stock units
