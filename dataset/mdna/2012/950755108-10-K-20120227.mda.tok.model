table of contents overview we operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry 
in the truckload sector  we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year 
in the logistics sector  besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers  we provide additional sources of truck capacity  alternative modes of transportation  a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently and effectively manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers with respect to our truckload segment or obtain qualified third party capacity at a reasonable price with respect to our vas segment 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
operating revenues reported in our operating statistics table under results of operations are categorized as i trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  ii trucking fuel surcharge revenues  iii non trucking revenues  including vas  and iv other operating revenues 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  and trucking fuel surcharge revenues are generated by the operating units in the truckload segment one way truckload and specialized services 
non trucking revenues  including vas  are generated primarily by the four operating units in our vas segment brokerage  freight management  intermodal and wgl  and a small amount is generated by the truckload segment 
other operating revenues are generated from other business activities such as third party equipment maintenance and equipment leasing 
in  trucking revenues net of fuel surcharge and trucking fuel surcharge revenues accounted for of total operating revenues  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for of total operating revenues 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  are typically generated on a per mile basis and also include revenues such as stop charges  loading and unloading charges  equipment detention charges  and equipment repositioning charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in fuel costs  we identify them separately in the operating statistics table and exclude them from the statistical calculations to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge  are i average revenues per tractor per week  ii average revenues per mile total and loaded  iii average annual miles per tractor  iv average percentage of empty miles miles without trailer cargo  v average trip length in loaded miles and vi average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal trucking industry freight patterns and industry capacity are important factors that impact these statistics 
our truckload segment also generates a small amount of revenues categorized as non trucking revenues  related to shipments delivered to or from mexico where the truckload segment utilizes a third party capacity provider 
we exclude such revenues from the statistical calculations 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  independent contractors  tractors and trailers 
our financial results are affected by company driver and independent contractor availability and the markets for new and used revenue equipment 
our most significant operating costs are fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  driver salaries and benefits  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
to mitigate our risk to fuel price increases  we recover from our customers additional fuel surcharges that generally recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims  workers compensation claims  and associate health claims supplemented by premium based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels 
for that reason  our financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the operating ratio is a common industry measure used to evaluate our profitability and that of our truckload segment operating fleets 
the operating ratio consists of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the truckload segment are driver salaries and benefits  fuel  fuel taxes  payments to independent contractors included in rent and purchased transportation expense  supplies and maintenance and insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary based on the number of miles driven 
we also evaluate these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues could cause costs to increase in these issues include shortages of drivers or independent contractors  changing fuel prices  higher new truck and trailer purchase prices and compliance with new or proposed regulations 
our main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
the truckload segment requires substantial cash expenditures for tractor and trailer purchases 
we fund these purchases with net cash from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 

table of contents we provide non trucking services primarily through the four operating units within our vas segment 
unlike our truckload segment  the vas segment is less asset intensive and is instead dependent upon qualified associates  information systems and qualified third party capacity providers 
the largest expense item related to the vas segment is the cost of purchased transportation we pay to third party capacity providers 
this expense item is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other operating expenses consist primarily of salaries  wages and benefits 
we evaluate vas s financial performance by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating income percentage 
the gross margin percentage can be impacted by the rates charged to customers and the costs of securing third party capacity 
we generally do not have contracted long term rates for the cost of third party capacity  and we cannot assure that our operating results will not be adversely impacted in the future if our ability to obtain qualified third party capacity providers changes or the rates of such providers increase 
results of operations the following operating statistics table sets forth certain industry data regarding our freight revenues and operations for the periods indicated 
trucking revenues  net of fuel surcharge trucking fuel surcharge revenues non trucking revenues  including vas other operating revenues operating revenues operating ratio consolidated average revenues per tractor per week average annual miles per tractor average annual trips per tractor average trip length in miles loaded total miles loaded and empty average revenues per total mile average revenues per loaded mile average percentage of empty miles average tractors in service total tractors at year end company independent contractor total tractors total trailers truckload and intermodal  at year end amounts in thousands 
operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
operating ratio is a common measure used in the trucking industry to evaluate profitability 
net of fuel surcharge revenues 
empty refers to miles without trailer cargo 
the following table sets forth the revenues  operating expenses and operating income for the truckload segment 
revenues for the truckload segment include non trucking revenues of million in  million in and million in  as described on page truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues operating expenses operating income higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge revenues increase our consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses 
eliminating fuel surcharge revenues  which are generally a more volatile source of revenue  provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period 
the following table calculates the truckload segment s operating ratio as if fuel surcharges are excluded from total revenues and instead reported as a reduction of operating expenses 

table of contents truckload transportation services amounts in s revenues less trucking fuel surcharge revenues revenues  net of fuel surcharges operating expenses less trucking fuel surcharge revenues operating expenses  net of fuel surcharges operating income the following table sets forth the vas segment s non trucking revenues  rent and purchased transportation expense  gross margin  other operating expenses and operating income 
other operating expenses for the vas segment primarily consist of salaries  wages and benefits expense 
vas also incurs smaller expense amounts in the supplies and maintenance  depreciation  rent and purchased transportation excluding third party transportation costs  insurance  communications and utilities and other operating expense categories 
value added services amounts in s revenues rent and purchased transportation expense gross margin other operating expenses operating income compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to trucking revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile offset by a decrease in average monthly miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market during was at levels comparable to the average weekly pre booked percentage of loads to trucks pre books for the one way truckload fleets in was fairly consistent with however  in second quarter  we experienced sluggish freight demand compared to unusually strong demand in the same quarter of this continued into the first half of third quarter and began to improve in the second half of third quarter freight demand in fourth quarter was better than fourth quarter we believe that generally favorable truckload freight trends are caused to a greater degree by supply constraints limiting truckload capacity  as opposed to demand generated by economic activity 
freight trends in our one way truckload fleets have shown steady and gradual seasonal improvement each week and freight is generally more balanced across the entire geographic network during the first seven weeks of compared to the same period of  with less non committed  temporary project freight in the period 
overall  freight trends thus far in are similar to those in  noting there was pent up demand in february following severe winter storms that occurred during mid january and early february average revenues per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to in from in in comparison  average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased because our average percentage of empty miles increased 
we attribute the higher revenue per mile to a combination of customer contractual rate increases and improved freight mix 
seasonal project work and periods of strong customer demand for truck capacity also contributed to the increase to a lesser extent 
the average percentage of empty miles increased by basis points from in to in the small increase can be attributed to freight market conditions and freight mix 
for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  we classify a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile or deadhead mile  thus  empty miles include those empty miles generated by our specialized services fleets  most of which are billable to our dedicated customers 
average annual miles per tractor decreased by from to due to fewer trips per tractor and a more challenging driver market 
the driver market conditions resulted in a reduction in the number of trainer team drivers and slightly higher driver turnover 
the average trip length in miles loaded decreased by miles  or  in compared to 
table of contents the average number of tractors in service decreased to  in from  in we currently plan to maintain our total truck count at approximately  trucks 
in the last six months  our truck count has operated slightly below this level due to the increasingly challenging driver market 
we continue to redesign our truckload freight network to optimize and maximize increasing freight opportunities without adding trucks 
as a result  we continue to look for ways to increase our operating income percentage to improve our returns on assets  equity and invested capital  while providing a broad portfolio of services for our customers 
fuel surcharge revenues represent collections from customers for the increase in fuel and fuel related expenses  including the fuel component of our independent contractor cost recorded as rent and purchased transportation expenses and fuel taxes recorded in taxes and licenses expense  when diesel fuel prices rise 
these revenues increased to million in from million in because of higher average fuel prices in on a total mile basis  fuel surcharge revenues increased cents  from cents in to cents in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins  we collect fuel surcharge revenues from our customers for the cost of diesel fuel and taxes in excess of specified base fuel price levels according to terms in our customer contracts 
fuel surcharge rates generally adjust weekly based on an independent doe fuel price survey which is released every monday 
our fuel surcharge programs are designed to i recoup higher fuel costs from customers when fuel prices rise and ii provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline 
these programs generally enable us to recover a majority  but not all  of the fuel price increases 
the remaining portion is generally not recoverable because it results from empty and out of route miles which are not billable to customers and truck idle time 
fuel prices that change rapidly in short time periods also impact our recovery because the surcharge rate in most programs only changes once per week 
we continue to diversify our business model 
our goal is to attain a more balanced revenue portfolio comprised of one way truckload  specialized and logistics which includes the vas segment services by growing our logistics services revenues 
vas revenues are generated by its four operating units and exclude revenues for vas shipments transferred to the truckload segment  which are recorded as trucking revenues by the truckload segment 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in most of the revenue increase occurred in the brokerage and intermodal units  offset partially by a decrease in freight management revenues 
the gross number of vas freight shipments decreased by year over year  but vas shifted fewer shipments not committed to third party capacity providers to our truckload segment 
thus the net number of vas shipments increased by 
vas gross margin dollars increased to million in from million in the vas gross margin percentage increased from in to in because of the lower cost of third party capacity 
the following table shows the changes that are described above in vas shipment volume and average revenue excluding logistics fee revenue per shipment for all vas shipments difference change total vas shipments less non committed shipments to truckload segment net vas shipments average revenue per shipment brokerage revenues increased in compared to due to increased shipment volume and increased revenue per shipment 
brokerage gross margin dollars increased year over year  and the gross margin percentage increased by basis points 
intermodal revenues increased  and its gross margin and operating income improved by an even higher percentage 
wgl revenues grew  while the gross margin and operating income improved significantly 
freight management revenues and the number of shipments declined significantly due to a reduction in customer project business with a specific customer  however its gross margin and operating income dollars showed only a slight decrease 
operating expenses our operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues was in compared to in expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages 
the tables on pages and show the operating ratios and operating margins for our two reportable segments  truckload and vas 

table of contents the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload segment for the periods indicated 
we evaluate operating costs for this segment on a per mile basis  which is a better measurement for comparing the results of operations from year to year 
increase decrease per mile salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other independent contractor costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
independent contractors supply their own tractors and drivers and are responsible for their operating expenses including driver pay  fuel  supplies and maintenance and fuel taxes 
independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this decrease in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
due to this decrease  we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was lower by approximately cents per total mile  and other expense categories had offsetting increases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cents  ii fuel  cents  iii depreciation  cents  iv supplies and maintenance  cents  and v taxes and licenses  cent 
salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment increased cents per mile on a total mile basis in compared to higher expense for workers compensation claims was the largest factor contributing to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits 
the workers compensation increase resulted primarily from increased cost of new claims 
the higher cost per mile of salaries  wages and benefits expense for compared to was also attributed to the shift from rent and purchased transportation expense to this expense category approximately cents per mile because of the decrease in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles 
smaller increases in non driver wages and k matching expense due to restoring the matching contribution percentage to its former level in january  after reducing it by half beginning april were offset by lower student pay due to a decrease in the average number of active trainer teams 
salaries  wages and benefits in the non trucking vas segment increased in compared to vas handled fewer shipments in compared to  including those transferred to the truckload segment  but the net shipments retained by vas increased by we renewed our workers compensation insurance coverage for the policy year beginning april  our coverage levels are the same as the prior policy year 
we continue to maintain a self insurance retention of million per claim 
our workers compensation insurance premiums for the policy year beginning april are similar to those for the previous policy year 
the driver market was increasingly competitive in compared to  and the supply of experienced drivers and recent driving school graduates continued to tighten 
we believe that an improved freight market  extended unemployment benefit payment programs  a reduction in available truck driving school graduates and changing industry safety regulations see the regulation subsection in item of part i of this form k are tightening driver supply 
however  we continue to believe our position in the current market is better than that of many competitors because over of our driving jobs are in more attractive  shorter haul regional and specialized services fleet operations that enable us to return drivers to their homes on a more frequent and consistent basis 
assuming the domestic economy strengthens in  we anticipate the driver market will become even more challenging in we are unable to predict whether we will experience future driver shortages 
if such a shortage were to occur and driver pay rate increases became necessary to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average diesel fuel prices in were cents per gallon higher than in  a increase 

table of contents we continue to employ measures to improve our fuel miles per gallon mpg  such as i limiting truck engine idle time  ii optimizing the speed  weight and specifications of our equipment and iii implementing mpg enhancing equipment changes to our fleet 
we continue to invest in fuel saving equipment solutions  which are also intended to lessen environmental impact  such as i new trucks with epa compliant engines  ii more aerodynamic truck features  iii idle reduction systems  iv tire inflation systems and v trailer skirts to reduce our fuel gallons purchased and improve our mpg 
these measures resulted in a improvement in mpg in compared to however  fuel savings from the mpg improvement is partially offset by higher depreciation expense and the additional cost of diesel exhaust fluid required in certain tractors with engines that meet the epa emission standards 
although our fuel management programs require significant investment and research and development  we intend to continue these and other environmentally conscious initiatives  including our active participation as a smartway transport partner 
the smartway transport partnership is a national voluntary program developed by the epa and freight industry representatives to reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution and promote cleaner  more efficient ground freight transportation 
for the first seven weeks of  the average diesel fuel price per gallon was approximately cents higher than the average diesel fuel price per gallon in the same period of and approximately cents higher than the average for first quarter shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing can have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we have historically been successful recouping a majority  but not all  of fuel cost increases through our fuel surcharge program 
we are unable to predict whether fuel price levels will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to the higher maintenance costs resulted primarily from higher tire expense and increases in other tractor related expenses  such as auxiliary power unit apu maintenance and the maintenance portion of preparing a larger amount of used trucks and trailers for sale 
in  we extended the replacement cycle for company tractors 
a longer replacement cycle resulted in higher maintenance costs  including maintenance that is not covered under warranty  and resulted in more tires being purchased and expensed as replacement tires  rather than capitalized as part of the equipment cost when new trucks are placed in service 
however  a longer replacement cycle delayed higher depreciation from the more expensive new trucks  which offsets a portion of the increased maintenance costs 
we have also incurred higher maintenance expenses on apus as these units reach the end of their warranty period  which along with the depreciation expense on the units partially offsets the resulting lower fuel expense incurred 
by purchasing new tractors during  we reduced the average age of our company truck fleet from years to years 
we believe the reduction of the average age of the company truck fleet may contribute to a decrease in some supplies and maintenance expenses in in the last year  the price of natural rubber has increased as global demand outpaces supply of this raw material  and prices are expected to remain high 
natural rubber is a major component in the production of tires  and most large tire producers have raised tire prices in and a series of price increases during and contributed to higher total tire expense in compared to on a per tire basis  the average cost of our tires increased approximately from the end of to the end of we have contracted pricing arrangements in place with our large tire vendors  but are subject to periodic price changes 
additionally  a shortage of natural rubber could affect availability of new tires  and thus  our truck productivity  and we are unable to predict when and the extent to which future tire pricing  tire availability and truck productivity could be impacted 
we purchased additional inventories of tires in the latter part of and to lessen the effects of a raw material shortage 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment did not change on a total mile basis in compared to higher state mileage taxes and the effect of lower average miles per tractor on the fixed cost components of this operating expense category were offset by fuel tax savings resulting from higher mpg 
an improved mpg results in fewer gallons of diesel fuel purchased and consequently less fuel taxes paid 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment decreased slightly by cents per total mile in compared to the decrease is primarily the result of lower expense related to large liability claims due to improved loss development and reimbursement from insurance carriers of expenses on large liability claims settled in prior periods 
these decreases were nearly offset by higher expense related to small liability claims  both from a higher average cost per new claim and from net unfavorable development on prior period claims in compared to net favorable loss development in the larger portion of our insurance and claims expense results from our claim experience and claim development under our self insurance program  the smaller portion results from insurance premiums for high dollar claim coverage 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continue to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million and an annual aggregate of million for claims in excess of million and less than million 

table of contents we maintain liability insurance coverage with insurance carriers substantially in excess of the million per claim 
see item of part i of this form k for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year that began august  are comparable to the previous policy year on a per mile basis 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to due primarily to higher tractor depreciation resulting from the higher cost of new trucks compared to the used trucks they are replacing  and  to a lesser extent  the effect of lower miles per truck 
the average cost of new trucks purchased in is approximately higher than the average cost of used trucks being sold in depreciation expense was historically affected by two changes to the engine emissions standards imposed by the epa that became effective in october and january  resulting in increased truck purchase costs 
we began to take delivery of trucks with these standard engines in first quarter to replace older trucks in our fleet 
a final set of more rigorous epa mandated emissions standards became effective for all new engines manufactured after january  trucks with standard engines have a higher purchase price than trucks manufactured to meet the standards  but the standard engines are more fuel efficient 
in  we purchased trucks with standard engines to replace older trucks that we sell or trade 
depreciation expense per mile increased due to higher prices for these new trucks and is expected to increase further as we continue to replace tractors 
as of december   of the engines in our fleet of company owned trucks were manufactured by caterpillar 
in june  caterpillar announced it would not produce on highway engines for use in the united states that would comply with the epa engine emissions standards  but caterpillar would continue to sell on highway engines internationally 
in  it was estimated that approximately one million trucks in the us domestic market have caterpillar heavy duty engines  and caterpillar has stated it will fully support these engines going forward 
the company has been successful in selling used trucks with caterpillar engines in the used truck market 
rent and purchased transportation expense consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas segment and other non trucking operations and payments to independent contractors in the truckload segment 
the payments to third party capacity providers generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the vas segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in due primarily to increased fuel prices that resulted in higher reimbursements to independent contractors for fuel  partially offset by a shift from rent and purchased transportation expense to salaries  wages and benefits and several other expense categories because of the decrease in independent contractor truck miles as a percentage of total miles 
fuel reimbursements to independent contractors amounted to million in compared to million in our customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company and independent contractor trucks 
challenging operating conditions continue to make independent contractor recruitment and retention difficult 
such conditions include inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and a shortage of financing available to independent contractors for equipment 
we have historically been able to add company tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decrease in the number of independent contractors 
if a shortage of independent contractors and company drivers occurs  increases in per mile settlement rates for independent contractors and driver pay rates for company drivers may become necessary to attract and retain these drivers 
this could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would not be able to obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
we entered into non cancelable operating leases for certain tractors during second quarter and expect the expense for these leases to be approximately million per quarter until second quarter these leases also contributed to the higher expense in compared to other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in compared to gains on sales of assets primarily used trucks and trailers are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses which include costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets increased to million in from million in in  we realized significantly higher average gains per truck sold and sold more trucks and trailers than in average gains per trailer sold were slightly higher 
the market for the sale of used trucks and trailers remains strong  and we believe our premium used trucks are becoming more attractive to fleets that want to upgrade their older trucks without incurring the higher cost of new trucks with standard engines 
we believe our wholly owned subsidiary and used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the larger class used truck and equipment retail entities in the united states 
fleet truck sales continues to be our resource for remarketing our used trucks and trailers  in addition to trading used trucks to original equipment manufacturers when purchasing new trucks 
cost increases related to professional fees and bad debt expense offset a portion of the improved gains 

table of contents other expense income we earned interest income of million in compared to million in income taxes our effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes remained at for and compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile 
a decrease in the average number of tractors in service was substantially offset by a increase in average monthly miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market improved throughout compared to  however  the level of improvement was better in the first half of the year than in the latter half 
the average weekly pre books for the one way truckload fleets in were better than those in throughout much of the year 
however  beginning in september  freight volumes softened and average weekly pre books for the remainder of were comparable to average revenues per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to in from in in comparison  average revenues per total mile increased because our average percentage of empty miles improved 
the improved freight market during  combined with rising contractual pricing and higher spot market rates  resulted in the increased revenue per mile 
weak market conditions in resulted in a high level of customer bid activity in the first half of  which contributed to lower rate levels in and early improving market conditions in  aided by a decreasing supply of truck capacity  enabled us to negotiate rate increases for some of our contractual business which became effective in the latter half of the average percentage of empty miles improved by basis points from in to in on a per trip basis  empty miles declined from miles per trip in to miles per trip in improved freight market conditions and our proactive fleet management decisions enabled us to be more selective with our freight choices  resulting in fewer empty miles 
the average number of tractors in service decreased to  in from  in average annual miles per tractor increased by from to  as more trips per tractor were offset by a shorter average trip length 
the average trip length in miles loaded decreased by miles  or  in compared to this decrease is the result of having fewer medium to long haul van trucks and more trucks in the shorter haul regional and specialized services fleet operations 
this trend has occurred since when we began to reduce the size of our medium to long haul van fleet 
fuel surcharge revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in vas revenues increased to million in from million in most of the revenue increase occurred in the brokerage and wgl units 
the gross number of vas freight shipments increased by year over year 
vas shifted about the same number of shipments not committed to third party capacity providers to our truckload segment  thus the net number of vas shipments increased by 
vas gross margin dollars increased to million in from million in however  the vas gross margin percentage decreased from in to in because of the higher cost of third party capacity in an improving freight market 
the following table shows the changes that are described above in shipment volume and average revenue excluding logistics fee revenue per shipment for all vas shipments difference change total vas shipments less non committed shipments to truckload segment net vas shipments average revenue per shipment

intermodal revenues increased  and its gross margin percentage and operating results improved in compared to wgl revenues grew  while the gross margin percentage and operating results decreased significantly due to a decrease in the number of higher margin shipments related to several international projects that ended during the latter part of second quarter operating expenses our operating ratio was in compared to in expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages 
the tables on pages and show the operating ratios and operating margins for our two reportable segments  truckload and vas 
the following table sets forth the cost per total mile of operating expense items for the truckload segment for the periods indicated 
increase decrease per mile salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this slight increase in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from other expense categories to the rent and purchased transportation category 
due to this increase  we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was higher by approximately cents per total mile  and other expense categories had offsetting decreases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cent  ii fuel  cent  and iii depreciation  cent 
salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment increased cents per mile on a total mile basis in compared to higher expense for workers compensation claims and unemployment taxes were the primary factors contributing to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits 
the workers compensation increase resulted primarily from increased negative loss development on existing claims and an increased cost of new claims 
our unemployment tax expense increased by million in from because various states in which we operate significantly raised their required unemployment tax contribution rates in smaller increases in driver and non driver wages were offset by lower student pay due to a decrease in the average number of active trainer teams 
the higher cost per mile of salaries  wages and benefits expense for compared to was offset slightly by the shift from this expense category to rent and purchased transportation expense because of the increase in independent contractor miles as a percentage of total miles 
during  we decreased the company matching contribution percentage for our k plan by half  and effective january   we restored it to the previous level 
non driver salaries  wages and benefits in the non trucking vas segment increased in compared to vas handled more shipments in compared to  including those transferred to the truckload segment  but the net shipments retained by vas increased by 
we renewed our workers compensation insurance coverage for the policy year that began april  our coverage levels were the same as the prior policy year 
we maintained a self insurance retention of million per claim 
our workers compensation insurance premiums for the policy year that began april were slightly lower than the previous policy year  due primarily to a lower premium rate per payroll dollar 
the driver recruiting and retention market became more competitive beginning in second quarter which continued into first quarter during third quarter  we implemented proactive measures that successfully improved our driver recruitment and retention despite the competitive driver market 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average diesel fuel prices in were cents per gallon higher than in  a increase 

table of contents during  we continued to employ fuel saving measures such as i limiting truck engine idle time  ii lowering non billable miles  iii utilizing aerodynamic  more fuel efficient trucks in the company truck fleet and iv equipping company trucks with apus or diesel fired heater units 
these measures resulted in a improvement in fuel mpg in compared to supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to the higher maintenance costs resulted primarily from an increase in the average age and odometer mileage of our company truck fleet 
because of the ongoing cost increases for new trucks and the weak used truck market  we extended the replacement cycle for company tractors in taxes and licenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a decrease in fuel taxes per mile resulting from the improvement in the company truck mpg 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to the decrease is primarily the result of lower expense related to smaller liability claims due to a significantly lower severity of claims and a lower frequency of claims in compared to  and  to a lesser extent  lower expense related to large liability claims due to improved loss development on older liability claims 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continued to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million and an annual aggregate of million for claims in excess of million and less than million 
we maintain liability insurance coverage with insurance carriers substantially in excess of the million per claim 
our liability insurance premiums for the policy year that began august  were slightly higher than the previous policy year  increasing less than cents per total mile 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a lower ratio of trailers to tractors and more trailers becoming fully depreciated  offset partially by higher tractor depreciation resulting from the higher cost of new trucks 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense increased to in compared to in because of the higher cost of third party capacity in an improving freight market 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in due primarily to increased fuel prices that resulted in higher reimbursements to independent contractors for fuel  as well as a shift to rent and purchased transportation expense from salaries  wages and benefits and several other expense categories because of the increase in independent contractor truck miles as a percentage of total miles 
fuel reimbursements to independent contractors amounted to million in compared to million in other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets increased to million in from million in the market for the sale of used trucks and trailers remained fairly stable in the first half of and began to improve in third quarter  and that trend accelerated in fourth quarter during  we realized higher average gains per truck and sold more trailers 
other expense income we earned interest income of million in compared to million in income taxes our effective income tax rate was for versus for the lower income tax rate in is attributed to higher income before income taxes  which caused non deductible expenses  such as driver per diem  to comprise a smaller percentage of our income before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million  a increase million  compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributed primarily to i a million decrease in income tax payments due to federal bonus depreciation provisions that apply to our increased new tractor and trailer purchases in  ii increased net income of million and iii an million increase in cash flows related to accounts payable 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in cash flows related to increased accounts receivable due to shipment growth at the end of the year and higher fuel surcharge billings at the end of due to higher fuel prices at the end of cash flow from operations increased million in from  or 
the increase in cash flow from operations in compared to was attributed primarily to i a million increase in cash flows related to insurance and claims accruals both current and long term due primarily to the settlement of some larger claims in  ii higher net income of million  iii an million increase in cash flows related to accounts payable and iv a million 
table of contents increase in cash flows related to accrued payroll 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in cash flows related to increased accounts receivable due to shipment growth at the end of the year and higher fuel surcharge billings at the end of due to higher fuel prices in and ii higher income tax payments of million during we were able to make net capital expenditures and pay dividends because of the cash flow from operations and existing cash balances  supplemented by net borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in from million in and by million in from net property additions primarily revenue equipment were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period of and million during this increase occurred primarily because we purchased more new trucks in the period than in the and periods 
as of december   we were committed to property and equipment purchases  net of trades  of approximately million 
we currently expect our estimated net capital expenditures primarily revenue equipment to be about to lower in the range of million to million in we intend to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
net financing activities used million in  million in and million in the decrease from to resulted from the decrease in the special dividend payment 
we paid quarterly and special dividends of million in  million in and million in the dividends paid in each of these years included special dividends of per share million total paid in december  per share million total paid in december and per share million total paid in december the decrease in financing cash flows provided by stock option exercises and the related tax benefits was nearly offset by financing inflows from checks issued in excess of cash balances 
from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on stock market conditions and other factors 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to our current board of directors repurchase authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes our financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of stockholders equity 
cash is invested primarily in government portfolio money market funds 
as of december   we had million of available credit pursuant to two credit facilities  of which we had no borrowings outstanding 
the million of credit available under these facilities is reduced by the million in letters of credit under which we are obligated 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies 
based on our strong financial position  management does not foresee any significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years period unknown contractual obligations unrecognized tax benefits property and equipment purchase commitments operating leases total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments unused lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments total obligations 
table of contents we have committed credit facilities with two banks totaling million that mature in may million and november million 
borrowings under these credit facilities bear variable interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities with banks 
in january  we borrowed million 
the credit available under these facilities is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit under which we are obligated 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the unused lines of credit are available to us in the event we need financing for the replacement of our fleet or for other significant capital expenditures 
management believes our financial position is strong  and we therefore expect that we could obtain additional financing  if necessary 
property and equipment purchase commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures  net of trades  primarily for revenue equipment 
as of december   we have recorded a million liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect million to be settled within the next twelve months and are unable to reasonably determine when the million categorized as period unknown will be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we began leasing certain tractors under non cancelable operating leases in may our future payment obligation under these leases at december  was approximately million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the i reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and ii reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from months to years 
during  we changed the estimated useful lives and salvage values used for depreciating our tractors to reflect an extended replacement cycle 
previously  we generally depreciated tractors over an estimated useful life of months  using an estimated salvage value equal to of the cost 
beginning in second quarter  we extended the estimated useful life to months and reduced the estimated salvage value to this change did not affect the monthly depreciation rate and thus had no effect on depreciation expense recorded during the year  but allows depreciation expense to continue beyond months in recognition of the extended replacement cycle for tractors 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjust these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  the carrying amount is not recoverable when the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows 
we do not separately identify assets by operating segment because tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of our long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all of our assets 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and non current are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates including negative development and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience 
an actuary reviews our self insurance reserves for bodily injury and property damage claims and workers compensation claims every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider including independent contractors under contract with us is utilized to provide some or all of the service and we i are the primary obligor in regard to the shipment delivery  ii establish customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  iii generally have discretion in carrier selection and or iv have credit risk on the shipment  we record both revenues for the dollar value of services we bill to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for transportation costs we pay to 
table of contents the third party provider upon the shipment s delivery 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  we record revenues net of those expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine i the provision for income taxes  ii whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part and iii the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if facts or financial circumstances change and consequently impact the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  we would need to apply management s judgment to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses and revenue adjustments in our existing accounts receivable 
we review the financial condition of customers for granting credit and monitor changes in customers financial conditions on an ongoing basis 
we determine the allowance based on analysis of individual customers financial condition  our historical write off experience and national economic conditions 
we have formal policies in place to continually monitor credit extended to customers and to manage our credit risk 
we maintain credit insurance for some customer accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on information currently available 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation may impact our operating costs 
a prolonged inflation period could cause rises in interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs 
these inflationary increases could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding at december  interest rates on our unused credit facilities are based on the libor 
increases in interest rates could impact our annual interest expense on future borrowings 
as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations attributed to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have recovered a majority  but not all  of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of our customers to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon 
however  we do not recover all of the fuel cost increase through these surcharge programs 
we cannot predict the extent to which fuel prices will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign countries  including mexico  canada  china and australia 
to date  most foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and we receive payment for foreign freight services primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk 
assets and liabilities maintained by a foreign subsidiary company in the local currency are subject to foreign exchange gains or losses 
foreign currency translation gains and losses primarily relate to changes in the value of revenue equipment owned by a subsidiary in mexico  whose functional currency is the peso 
foreign currency translation losses were million in  and gains were million in and million in and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the exchange rate between the mexican peso and the us dollar was pesos to at december  compared to pesos to at december  and pesos to at december
