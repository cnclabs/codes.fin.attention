item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operations overview we are primarily engaged in real estate operations  which include agriculture and development  as well as golf course operations 
we own approximately  acres in florida  net of the approximate acres we have written off as described below  of which approximately  are located within and form a substantial portion of the western boundary of the city of daytona beach 
our lands are well located in central florida s interstate corridor  providing an opportunity for reasonably stable growth in future years 
until the dramatic downturn in the national and local economies in  activity on company owned lands had been strong over the preceding several years 
during  land transactions were minimal with no activity occurring in or over the last several years  roads and interstate overpasses  which benefit company owned land  have been constructed  extended  or improved 
historical sales and profits are not indicative of future results because of the unique nature of real estate transactions and variations in the cost basis of owned land 
a significant portion of the company s profits in any given year may be generated through relatively large commercial real estate transactions 
the process for these real estate transactions  from the time of preliminary discussions through contract negotiations  due diligence periods  and the closing  can last from several months to several years 
the trend in company profits in through  in particular profits from real estate transactions during that period  followed the overall general trend of the national and local economies and the real estate markets 
the residential real estate market reached its peak in late and early  weakening thereafter with the market hampered by the overall economy and credit crisis 
the local commercial real estate market lagged the residential market downturn by approximately two years 
we entered with a relatively strong contract backlog of real estate contracts 
as the economy  real estate markets  and credit markets continued to slow  several of the contracts in place did not result in closings as buyers took a more conservative approach 
although there have been recent signals of improvement in the overall economy and credit markets  we do not expect a significant improvement of economic conditions  in particular the real estate market  during the company does anticipate the possibility of a few select opportunities to generate real estate transactions in the near term 
as part of our strategy to prepare the company for the potential upturn in the real estate market  two major land use initiatives were pursued a major comprehensive land use plan change on approximately  acres of land west of i and south of state road and a rescission of the  acre lpga development of regional impact development order 
the comprehensive land use change  which was approved in late  provides for significantly increased residential and commercial density on the land  which includes  residential units and million square feet of commercial development 
we expect that the rescission that was approved in june will relieve the company of many regulatory requirements 
the company has evaluated the carrying value of certain assets 
in doing so  we have written off as an impairment charge the  cost basis of the acre property within the lpga development  due to recently rising assessments and carrying costs associated with these parcels relative to the current market environment 
in  we initiated a strategy of investing in income properties utilizing the proceeds from real estate transactions qualifying for income tax deferral through like kind exchange treatment for tax purposes 
through the end of  we had invested approximately million in twenty six income properties through this process  one of which was sold at the end of the year 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the lakeland  florida property  formerly occupied by barnes noble  was sold in the fourth quarter of at a price of  a profit approximating  was recognized on this transaction 
proceeds from this transaction are anticipated to be reinvested in an additional income producing property through the section tax deferred like kind exchange process 
with the investment base in income properties  lease revenue of approximately million is projected to be generated annually 
this income  along with income from additional net lease income property investments  is expected to continue to decrease earnings volatility in future years and add to overall financial performance 
this has enabled us to enter into the business of building  leasing  and holding in our portfolio select income properties that are strategically located on our lands 
the lease on the barnes noble store located on international speedway boulevard in daytona beach  florida  was scheduled to expire at the end of january  excluding option years

the company owns three rbc centura bank rbc retail banking sites in florida and georgia 
in june  rbc agreed to sell its us retail banking unit to pnc financial services group inc the company does not expect the sale  which is scheduled to close in  to have an immediate impact on these properties 
during the fourth quarter of  rbc closed its branch in altamonte springs  florida 
the tenant is obligated on the lease and continues to make lease payments 
the company is continually reviewing its income property portfolio for potential asset sales 
the review has resulted in the listing of six income properties for sale 
we have received offers on two of these properties
