item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements and estimates that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences from estimates include those discussed under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors contained in item above 
overview westmoreland coal company is an energy company employing approximately  employees whose operations include six surface coal mines in montana  wyoming  north dakota and texas  and two coal fired power generating units in north carolina 
we sold million tons of coal in our two principal operating segments are our coal segment and our power segment  in addition to two non operating segments 
one of the major factors affecting the volume of coal that we sell in any given year is the domestic demand for coal generated electric power  as well as the specific demand for coal by our customers 
numerous factors affect the domestic demand for electric power and the specific demands of customers including weather patterns  the presence of hydro or wind in any particular energy grid  environmental and legal challenges  political influences  energy policies  international and domestic economic conditions  power plant outages and other factors discussed herein 
we sell almost all of our coal and electricity production under long term agreements 
our long term coal contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised in line with cost inflation 
the contract may adjust the price in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
we refer to these contracts as cost plus contracts 
for our contracts that are not cost plus in nature  we have exposure to inflation and price risk for supplies that are used in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel and explosives 
in line with the worldwide mining industry  we have experienced increased operating costs for mining equipment  diesel fuel and supplies  such as tires 
we manage these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivatives from time to time 
recent developments on december   we entered into an agreement with chevron mining inc  to acquire the kemmerer surface coal mine located in kemmerer  wyoming 
we closed on this acquisition on january  this transaction included approximately million tons of total proven or probable coal reserves as of december   and has an estimated life at current production levels of approximately years 
we funded the acquisition through a combination of cash proceeds of million from our additional note offering plus the assumption of liabilities  including retiree medical benefits for current and prospective union employees  the underfunded portion of the pension and certain reclamation obligations 
in january  we completed the private placement of million of senior secured notes due in  which notes were additional notes issued under the existing parent notes indenture 
we funded the kemmerer acquisition through the net proceeds from the offering 
we are required to register the debt issued under the add on notes offering with the sec within days after the completion of the offering  which was january  in november  an explosion and subsequent fire occurred at unit of xcel energy s sherburne county generating station  which is the largest customer of our absaloka mine 
xcel indicated that unit will be offline for an extended period while xcel investigates the source of the explosion and the extent of the damage 
westmoreland resources  inc  or wri  our wholly owned subsidiary that runs the absaloka mine  maintains business interruption insurance coverage and submitted a notice of loss to its insurance carriers 
while our insurance carriers have accepted liability under the policy for the business interruption claim  we are currently unable to determine the financial impact of this fire on us due to the uncertainty of when unit will resume operation 
our contract with coyote station  located adjacent to our beulah mine  expires in may we have been negotiating with the coyote station owners in a competitive bid process for another long term supply contract 
based on the direction of those negotiations  we have changed various accounting estimates due to the uncertainty of entering into a new agreement upon the conclusion of the current contract in these changes in estimates took effect in the fourth quarter of and resulted in revised depreciable asset and coal reserve lives and asset retirement obligations 
in  the change in estimate increased depreciation  depletion and accretion expense by million and increased the asset retirement obligation by million 

table of contents results of operations items that affect comparability of our results for and each of the prior two years  our results have included items that do not relate directly to ongoing operations 
the income expense components of these items were as follows september  september  september  year ended december  in thousands loss on extinguishment of debt fair value adjustment on derivative and related amortization of debt discount heritage legal claim settlement reclamation claim impact pre tax tax effect of other comprehensive income gains items recorded in we recorded million of loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of the parent notes offering 
the loss included a million make whole payment for rova s debt and million of non cash write offs of unamortized discount on debt and related capitalized debt costs and convertible debt conversion expense 
upon the parent notes offering and subsequent retirement of our convertible debt  we recorded an expense of million resulting from the mark to market accounting for the conversion feature in the notes with million of interest expense of a related debt discount 
items recorded in we recorded expense of million resulting from the mark to market accounting of the conversion feature in our convertible notes  primarily due to an increase in our stock price during  with million of interest expense of a related debt discount 
items recorded in we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to a tax effect of other comprehensive income gains  primarily related to a decrease in our postretirement medical obligations 
we recorded income of million resulting from the mark to market accounting of the conversion feature in our convertible notes and a decrease in the value of our warrant offset with million of interest expense of a related debt discount 
we recorded a gain of million related to a settlement of past heritage claims  as a result of efforts to reduce our heritage costs 
we recorded million in net expense related to the settlement of the reclamation claim at our rosebud mine 
this included a million reduction in revenue  offset with a million reduction in cost of sales

the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a million decrease in our coal segment revenues due to unusually strong hydropower conditions that displaced our customers coal generated power  flooding conditions that disrupted rail service resulting in a disruption of deliveries to a key customer  and to a lesser extent  a fire at a key customer s plant 
in addition  our power segment revenues decreased million due to a decrease in megawatt hours sold as a result of a planned maintenance outage 
our net loss applicable to common shareholders increased by million during excluding the million of expense in and the million of expense in discussed in items that affect comparability of our results 
the primary factors  in aggregate  driving this increase in net loss were september  in millions increase in interest expense primarily due to the parent notes offering decrease in our coal segment operating income primarily driven by hydropower and flooding conditions  and a fire at a key customer s plant increase in our heritage segment operating expenses primarily driven by updated cost projections and unfavorable discount rates increase in our corporate segment operating expenses primarily due to office relocation expenses decrease due to other factors increased losses attributable to noncontrolling interest related to increased losses from a partially owned consolidated coal segment subsidiary increase in our power segment operating income primarily due to decreased maintenance expenses  partially offset with decreased megawatt hours sold due to longer planned maintenance outages total

our coal segment revenues and operating income decreased primarily because of the unusually strong hydropower conditions  which displaced our customers coal generated power 
coal revenues also decreased due to flooding conditions  which disrupted rail service to our absaloka mine and  to a lesser extent  due to a fire at a key customer s plant

our power segment revenues for decreased primarily due to longer planned maintenance outages 
our power segment operating income increased because in  we executed a planned major maintenance project that occurs every five years 
maintenance expenses were therefore lower in and the decrease in maintenance expenses was partially offset by the reduction in revenues discussed above

nonoperating results including interest expense  interest income  other income loss  income tax benefit  and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest our interest expense for increased to million compared with million for primarily due to the higher overall debt levels resulting from the parent notes offering 
our interest income for decreased to million compared with million for due to lower interest rates 
our other loss for was comparable to our income tax benefit for increased to million compared with million for due to lower taxable income 
our loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for increased to million compared with million for related to increased losses from a partially owned consolidated coal segment subsidiary

the increase in revenues was primarily driven by a million increase in our coal segment revenues due to price increases under existing coal supply agreements and the commencement of new agreements including the new cost plus contract with our rosebud mine s unit buyers 
additionally in  we experienced customer shutdowns at our rosebud and beulah mines  whereas comparable shutdowns did not occur during we refer to these shutdowns as the customer shutdowns 
in addition  our power segment revenues increased million related to an increase in megawatt hours sold as a result of a planned major maintenance outage  which occurs every five years  and a significant unplanned outage  both of which occurred in no comparable outages occurred in our net loss applicable to common shareholders decreased by million during excluding the million of expense in and the million of income in discussed in items that affect comparability of our results

our coal segment revenues increased primarily from the increase in tons sold due to the customer shutdowns  price increases under existing coal supply agreements  and the start of new agreements including the new cost plus contract with our rosebud mine s unit buyers 
our coal segment operating income increased by million  excluding the million related to the reclamation claim discussed in items that affect comparability of our results 
this increase was primarily driven by the factors increasing revenue described above as well as strong cost management performance by several of our mines

this decrease was primarily due to the agreement we entered into to modernize how we provide prescription drug benefits to our retirees 
in addition  while we continue to work towards further heritage cost reductions  selling and administrative costs decreased due to reduced cost containment expenses 
finally  we experienced a favorable change in the valuation of our black lung liabilities due to changes in discount rates 
corporate segment operating results our corporate segment operating expenses for remained consistent with expenses for nonoperating results including other income expense  income tax benefit  and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest our other expense for increased to million compared with million of expense for this is primarily due to the million impact of the fair value adjustment on derivatives and related amortization of debt discount discussed in items that affect comparability of our results 
our income tax benefit was million in compared with million in excluding the million tax effect of other comprehensive income gains discussed in items that affect comparability of our results  our income tax benefit remained consistent with our loss attributable to noncontrolling interest for increased to million compared with million for related to increased losses from a partially owned consolidated coal segment subsidiary 
reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss the discussion in results of operations in  and includes references to our adjusted ebitda results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are key metrics used by us to assess our operating performance and we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because these measures are used widely by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  and 
table of contents help investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
the items excluded from ebitda and adjusted ebitda are significant in assessing our operating results 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
for example  ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments  do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements necessary to pay income taxes  do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  and do not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on certain of our debt obligations 
in addition  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
other companies in our industry and in other industries may calculate ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently from the way that we do  limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda and adjusted ebitda only as supplemental data 
the tables below show how we calculated adjusted ebitda  including a breakdown by segment  and reconciles adjusted ebitda to net less  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
september  september  september  december  in thousands reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net loss net loss income tax benefit expense from continuing operations other income loss interest income loss on extinguishment of debt interest expense depreciation  depletion and amortization accretion of aro and receivable amortization of intangible assets and liabilities ebitda customer reclamation claim gain loss on sale of assets share based compensation adjusted ebitda september  september  september  december  in thousands adjusted ebitda by segment coal power heritage corporate total 
table of contents september  september  september  december  in thousands adjusted ebitda guarantor and issuer non guarantor total significant anticipated variances between and and related uncertainties we expect a number of factors to result in differences in our results of operation  financial condition and liquidity in relative to  including the following we expect increased revenues  profits and operating cash flows as a result of the kemmerer acquisition  we expect our overall coal tons delivered to increase primarily as a result of the kemmerer acquisition and due to the fact that our tonnage sales were materially adversely impacted by a record hydropower year and flooding issues  we expect a decrease in coal tons delivered by our absaloka mine due to the explosion and subsequent fire that occurred at unit of xcel energy s sherburne county generating station 
we expect profits lost due to the explosion to be covered by business interruption insurance  we expect increased profits  as we do not expect a similar loss on debt extinguishment to occur in as occurred in  we expect an increase in our depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expenses in due primarily to the kemmerer acquisition  we expect to make additional capital investments during in the range of million to million to improve our mining and power operations and decrease our equipment maintenance costs 
additionally  we expect to increase the investments made in acquiring coal reserves in  we expect higher overall levels of cash and liquidity throughout as a result of the kemmerer acquisition and if we are successful in entering into a revolving credit facility  we expect higher overall levels of debt throughout as a result of the add on notes offering  we expect an increase in the amortization of long term debt resulting from the increase in scheduled repayments of our wml term debt  our interest expense and interest payments will increase in due to the add on notes offering  we expect our pension expenses and required contributions to increase as a result of the kemmerer acquisition and decreases in pension discount rates  we expect our postretirement medical expenses to increase as a result of the kemmerer acquisition and decreases in postretirement medical discount rates  and we expect increased surety bond collateral requirements due to the kemmerer acquisition 
the impact of items listed above will vary depending on the results of the purchase price accounting relating to the kemmerer acquisition 
liquidity and capital resources following the parent and add on notes offerings  we expect our primary sources of liquidity to be cash from operations supplemented as necessary with cash on hand 
as a result of significant increases in operating profits  the benefits of the cash flow from the kemmerer acquisition and a decrease in our heritage health benefit costs  we anticipate that our cash from operations  cash on hand and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our investing  financing  and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  was million 

table of contents we are actively working with potential creditors to enter into a revolving credit facility of up to million at the parent level  as permitted by the indenture 
if we are successful  this revolving credit facility would be secured by a first priority lien on our  the co issuer s  the guarantors and absaloka coal  llc s inventory  accounts receivable and proceeds thereof  and the notes will then be secured by a second priority lien on that collateral 
we are a holding company and conduct our operations through subsidiaries  some of which have obtained separate financing 
as a holding company  we have significant cash requirements to fund our debt obligations  ongoing heritage health benefit costs and pension contributions  and corporate overhead expenses 
the principal sources of cash flow to us are distributions from our principal operating subsidiaries 
the cash at wml is available to us through quarterly distributions 
the wml credit agreement requires a debt service account and imposes timing and other restrictions on the ability of wml to distribute funds to us 
as we begin to repay large portions of the principal on the wml notes  cash available for dividend from wml is also affected 
the cash at wrmi is available to us through dividends and is subject to maintaining a statutory minimum level of capital  which is two hundred and fifty thousand dollars

the indenture governing the parent notes requires us to offer to redeem the notes on an annual basis with certain excess cash flow as defined in the indenture  and amounts used for such redemptions will not be available for other purposes 
we do not have excess cash flow for in connection with the parent notes offering  we terminated the wri and rova revolving credit agreements 
the wml credit agreements remained in place following the offering 
following the parent notes offering  we are able to enter into a parent level revolving credit facility without the consent of the holders of the notes  subject to certain conditions 

table of contents kemmerer mine acquisition the net proceeds from the add on notes offering financed the million cash portion of the purchase price and an estimated million to satisfy the cash bonding obligations for the kemmerer mine 
the proceeds also covered the cash transaction costs associated with the kemmerer acquisition and the add on notes offering of approximately million 
the balance of the proceeds will be used to fund the initial operating expenses associated with the kemmerer mine

wml s revolving line of credit is only available to fund the operations of its respective subsidiaries 
wml s credit agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants 
operational covenants in the agreements prohibit  among other things  wml from incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  creating liens on its assets  making investments or engaging in asset sales or transactions with affiliates  in each case subject to specified exceptions 
financial covenants in the agreements impose requirements relating to specified debt service coverage and leverage ratios 
the debt service coverage ratio must meet or exceed a specified minimum 
the leverage ratio covenant requires that wml not permit the ratio of total debt at the end of each quarter to ebitda both as defined for the four quarters then ended to be greater than a specified amount 
wml met all of its covenant requirements as of december  and expects to meet all covenant requirements for the foreseeable future

represents benefit payments for our postretirement medical benefits  black lung  workers compensation  and combined benefit fund plans  as well as contributions for our defined benefit pension plans and final reclamation costs 
amounts shown are subsequent to the notes offering in january amounts shown are subsequent to the kemmerer mine acquisition in january critical accounting policies postretirement medical benefits we have an obligation to provide postretirement medical benefits to our former employees and their dependents 
detailed information related to this liability is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our liability for our employees postretirement medical benefit costs is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in amounts equal to the actuarially determined liability  as this obligation is not funded 
we use various assumptions including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the cost and obligation for this item 
our discount rate for postretirement medical benefit is determined by utilizing a hypothetical bond portfolio model  which approximates the future cash flows necessary to service our liability 
this model is calculated using a yield curve that is developed using the average yield for bonds in the tenth to ninetieth percentiles  which excludes bonds with outlier yields 
our discount rate at december  was compared to at december  in  our postretirement medical benefit liability increased million primarily from decreases in discount rates and updated cost projections 
we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree health care obligations 
our medical trend assumption is developed by annually examining the historical trend of our cost per claim data and projecting forward the participant claims and our current benefit coverage 
these projections include the continuation of cost savings we achieved in from the modernization of how we provide prescription drug benefits to retirees 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to satisfy these or additional obligations 
the ppaca could potentially impact these benefits 
the ppaca has both short term and long term implications on healthcare benefit plan standards 
implementation of this legislation is planned to occur in phases  with plan standard changes taking effect beginning in  but to a greater extend with the benefit plan year and extending through we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ppaca in future periods as additional information  interpretations and guidance becomes available 

table of contents below we have provided a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the significance of the health care cost trend rate assumptions in relation to reported amounts 
september  september  postretirement medical benefits health care cost trend rate increase decrease in thousands effect on service and interest cost components effect on postretirement medical benefit obligation asset retirement obligations  final reclamation costs and reserve estimates our asset retirement obligations primarily consist of cost estimates for final reclamation of surface land and support facilities at both surface mines and power plants in accordance with federal and state reclamation laws 
asset retirement obligations are based on projected pit configurations at the end of mining and are determined for each mine using estimates and assumptions including estimates of disturbed acreage as determined from engineering data  estimates of future costs to reclaim the disturbed acreage  the timing of these cash flows  and a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
as changes in estimates occur such as mine plan revisions  changes in estimated costs  or changes in timing of the final reclamation activities  the obligation and asset are revised to reflect the new estimate after applying the appropriate credit adjusted  risk free rate to the changes 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could be materially different from currently estimated 
moreover  regulatory changes could increase our obligation to perform final reclamation and mine closing activities 
certain of our customers have either agreed to reimburse us for final reclamation expenditures as they are incurred or have pre funded a portion of the expected reclamation costs 
see additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes and deferred income taxes as of december   we had significant deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets include federal and state regular net operating losses  or nols  alternative minimum tax  or amt  credit carryforwards  indian coal tax credits  or ictc  carryforwards  and net deductible reversing temporary differences related to on going differences between book and taxable income 
we believe we will be taxed under the amt system for the foreseeable future due to the significant amount of statutory tax depletion in excess of book depletion expected to be generated by our mining operations 
as a result  we have determined that a valuation allowance is required for all of our regular federal net operating loss carryforwards and amt credit carryforwards since they are only available to offset future regular taxes 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance for all of our state nols since we believe they will not be realized 
we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required for all of our ictc carryforward 
the ictc can generally be used to offset amt liability 
we do not believe we have sufficient positive evidence to substantiate that our deferred tax asset for the ictc carryforward is realizable at a more likely than not level of assurance 
as a result  we will continue to record a full valuation allowance on our ictc carryforward  reversing valuation allowance only if utilized in a future year 
we have determined that since our net deductible temporary differences will not reverse for the foreseeable future  and we are unable to forecast when we will have regular taxable income when they do reverse  a full valuation allowance is required for these deferred tax assets  other than the deferred tax asset relating to our uncertain tax positions 
the tax effect of pretax income or loss from continuing operations is generally determined by a computation that does not consider the tax effects of items that are not included in continuing operations 
the exception to that incremental approach is that all items for example  items recorded in other comprehensive income  extraordinary items  and discontinued operations be considered in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that shall be allocated to continuing operations 
recent accounting pronouncements the accounting standards adopted in did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
we utilize surety bonds and letters of credit issued by financial institutions to third parties to assure the performance of our obligations relating to reclamation  workers compensation obligations  postretirement medical benefit obligations  and other obligations 
these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use a combination of surety bonds and letters of credit to secure our financial obligations for reclamation  workers compensation  postretirement medical benefit and other obligations as follows as of december  september  september  september  september  september  reclamation obligations workers compensation obligations post retirement medical benefit obligations other total in thousands surety bonds letters of credit item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  which includes adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk we manage our price risk for coal sales  electricity and steam production through the use of long term agreements  rather than through the use of derivatives 
we estimate that almost of our coal and our electricity production are sold under long term agreements 
these coal contracts typically contain price escalation and adjustment provisions  pursuant to which the price for our coal may be periodically revised 
the price may be adjusted in accordance with changes in broad economic indicators such as the consumer price index  commodity specific indices such as the ppi light fuel oils index  and or changes in our actual costs 
for our contracts which are not cost plus  we have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel and explosives 
we manage these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivatives from time to time 
at december   we had fuel supply contracts outstanding with a minimum purchase requirement of million gallons of diesel fuel per year 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exception under hedge accounting 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates due to our existing indebtedness that is indexed to either prime rate or libor 
however  based on the balances outstanding as of december   our exposure to interest rate risk is not material as of such date 
in the future  if we were to draw on our wml revolving credit facility  or if we enter into a new credit facility indexed to a variable interest rate  such as the prime rate or libor  then we would be exposed to market risk associated with interest rates 
we have not historically used interest rate hedging instruments to manage our interest rate risk
