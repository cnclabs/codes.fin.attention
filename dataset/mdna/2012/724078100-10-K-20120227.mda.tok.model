external factors impacting our business performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity 
overall market conditions are a product of many factors  which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable 
these factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors  including their level of participation in the financial markets 
in turn  these decisions may affect our business results 
with respect to financial market activity  our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions  the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets  changes in interest rates especially rapid and extreme changes  the level and shape of various yield curves  the volume and value of trading in securities  and the demand for asset management services as reflected by the amount of assets under management 
factors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results 
for example  our business focuses on a middle market clientele in specific industry sectors 
if the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted disproportionately as compared to the economy as a whole  or does not recover on pace with other sectors of the economy  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
in addition  our business could be affected differently than overall market trends 
given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses  our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results 
as a participant in the financial services industry  we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of our business 
in recent years and following the credit crisis of  legislators and regulators increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry  resulting in fundamental changes to the manner in which the industry is regulated and increased regulation in a number of areas 
for example  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in bringing sweeping change to financial services regulation in the us changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could affect our business and the competitive environment  potentially adversely 

table of contents outlook for uncertain macroeconomic conditions and increased volatility weighed heavily on the capital markets in higher volatility in the second half of created an environment where equity financing activity  particularly initial public offerings  was curtailed in the u 
s and hong kong 
although certain us economic and market fundamentals appear to be improving  we anticipate that a challenging environment will persist in due to uncertainties surrounding the pace and sustainability of the global economic recovery  implications of high government deficit levels  concerns about european sovereign debt defaults  and the us national elections 
our hong kong operations were particularly hard hit in as the global macroeconomic challenges  rate of economic growth in china  and certain factors specific to china based companies severely impacted revenue generation and profitability from our hong kong operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we took actions to reduce our asian cost infrastructure  however  we expect our asian operations to remain challenged in in  debt financing revenues were negatively impacted by reduced municipal underwriting levels stemming from continued uncertainties over municipal issuer credit quality and fiscal budgets 
we expect the municipal underwriting market to improve during  although remain below historical volumes 
interest rates in were at historically low levels as the us economic recovery remained sluggish and the european debt crisis remained unresolved 
this drove us treasury yields lower and credit spreads widened  which negatively impacted our fixed income institutional business as we experienced reduced customer activity and investors moved into shorter term securities 
we expect interest rates to remain at relatively low levels in and that the difficult fixed income environment will continue 
lastly  the volatile market conditions in created a challenging environment for our asset management business 
our asset management performance in will continue to be dependent upon equity valuations and our investment performance  which can impact the amount of client inflows and outflows of assets under management 
based upon our expectation of continued challenging market fundamentals facing certain aspects of our business  we anticipate taking additional actions in to reduce our cost infrastructure 
these actions may result in restructuring related expenses in  although we cannot presently determine the timing or magnitude of any such expenses  such expenses could be material to our operating results in the period taken depending  in part  on the results for that period 
restructuring of european operations in the fourth quarter of  we restructured our european operations to focus resources on two areas the distribution of us and asia securities to european institutional investors and merger and acquisition advisory services 
with the narrowed focus  our european operations returned to profitability in

management fees are generally based on the level of assets under management aum measured monthly or quarterly  and an increase or reduction in assets under management  due to market price fluctuations or net client asset flows  will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed  with higher fees earned on equity and mlp investments  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
performance fees are earned when the investment return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark targets or other performance targets over a specified measurement period 
the level of performance fees earned can vary significantly from period to period and these fees may not necessarily be correlated to changes in total assets under management

recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  and are incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to practices within the securities industry 
the preparation of financial statements in compliance with gaap and industry practices requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require us to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by us to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical  including whether the estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information eg third party or independent sources  the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be used under gaap 
for a full description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are our critical accounting policies 
valuation of financial instruments financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  and certain firm investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments recorded at fair value  either as required by accounting guidance or through the fair value election 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the nature of our business and our role as a dealer in the securities industry  the fair value of our financial instruments are determined internally 
our processes are designed to ensure that the fair values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  unobservable inputs are developed based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data  including prices evidenced by market transactions  interest rates  credit spreads  volatilities and correlations and other security specific information 
valuation adjustments related to illiquidity or counterparty credit risk are also considered 
in estimating fair value  we may utilize information provided by third party pricing vendors to corroborate internally developed fair value estimates 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all 
table of contents products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
results from valuation models and other valuation techniques in one period may not be indicative of the future period fair value measurement 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of such financial instruments are the cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar quality and yield  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
in addition  even where we derive the value of a security based on information from an independent source  certain assumptions may be required to determine the security s fair value 
for example  we assume that the size of positions that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current estimated fair value 
depending upon the product and terms of the transaction  the fair value of our derivative contracts can be observed or priced using models based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments  including contractual terms  market prices  recovery values  yield curves  credit curves and measures of volatility 
the valuation models and underlying assumptions are monitored over the life of the derivative product 
if there are any changes necessary in the underlying inputs  the model is updated for those new inputs 
fasb accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to inputs with little or no pricing observability level iii measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement

we employ specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair value of our financial instruments 
our processes are designed to ensure that our internally estimated fair values are accurately recorded 
table of contents and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques used are appropriate  consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
individuals outside of our trading departments perform independent pricing verification reviews 
in developing these procedures  we consider the nature and complexity of securities involved eg term  coupon  collateral  and other key drivers of value  level of market activity for securities  and availability of market data 
our procedures include  but are not limited to  analysis of trade data both internal and external where available  corroboration to the valuation of positions with similar characteristics  risks and components  or comparison to an alternative pricing source  such as a discounted cash flow model 
senior management provides oversight and overall responsibility for the internal control processes and procedures related to fair value measurements 
goodwill and intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million 
this goodwill balance consists of million recorded in as a result of the acquisition of ari and million recorded in as a result of the acquisition of famco 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist that could indicate possible impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting units based on the following factors our market capitalization  a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
valuation multiples may be based on revenues  price to earnings and tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and business segments 
these multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences including size  operating leverage and other factors 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are compared with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
as noted above  the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and the subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets or businesses will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
our estimated cash flows typically extend for five years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended time period 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces and changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  discount rates and market conditions 
to assess the reasonableness of cash flow estimates and validate assumptions used in our estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and our industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november   which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
the charge relates to our capital markets reporting unit and primarily pertains to goodwill created from the acquisition of our predecessor  piper jaffray companies 
table of contents inc  and its subsidiaries by us bancorp  which was retained by us when we spun off from us bancorp on december  we estimated the fair value of our capital markets reporting unit using the following factors our market capitalization  a discounted cash flow model and public market comparables 
our market capitalization was measured based on the average closing price for piper jaffray companies common stock over the month of november and was adjusted to include an estimate for a control premium 
our discounted cash flow model was based on our five year plan and included an estimated terminal value based upon historical transaction valuations 
public market industry peers were valued based on earnings and tangible common equity 
there were no recent mergers and acquisitions involving public transactions to consider in the goodwill evaluation 
the impairment charge resulted from deteriorating economic and market conditions and declining profitability in  which led to reduced valuations in the factors discussed above 
our annual goodwill impairment testing resulted in no impairment associated with the famco or ari reporting units  within our asset management operating segment 
we also tested the intangible assets indefinite and definite lived acquired as part of the famco and ari acquisitions and concluded there was no impairment 
stock based compensation as part of our compensation to employees and directors  we use stock based compensation  consisting of restricted stock and stock options 
the company accounts for equity awards in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at grant date fair value over the service period of the award  net of estimated forfeitures 
we grant shares of restricted stock to current employees as part of year end compensation annual grants and as a retention tool 
employees may receive restricted stock upon initial hiring or as a retention award sign on grants 
we have also granted restricted stock awards with service conditions to key employees retention grants  as well as restricted stock awards with performance conditions to members of senior management performance grants 
upon closing of the ari acquisition in march  we granted restricted stock to ari employees inducement grants 
annual grants are made each february for the prior fiscal year performance and constitute a portion of an employee s annual incentive for the prior year 
we recognize the compensation expense prior to the grant date of the award as we determined that the service inception date precedes the grant date 
these grants are not subject to service requirements that employees must fulfill in exchange for the right to these awards  as the grants continue to vest after termination of employment  so long as the employee does not violate certain post termination restrictions as set forth in the award agreements or any agreements entered into upon termination 
prior to  annual grants were subject to three year cliff vesting 
beginning in  annual grants are subject to annual ratable vesting over a three year period 
unvested shares are subject to post termination restrictions 
these post termination restrictions do not meet the criteria for an in substance service condition as defined by asc accordingly  such shares of restricted stock comprising annual grants are expensed in the period to which those awards are deemed to be earned  which is the calendar year preceding the february grant date 
if any of these awards are forfeited  the lower of the fair value at grant date or the fair value at the date of forfeiture is recorded within the consolidated statements of operations as other income 
sign on grants are used as a recruiting tool for new employees and are issued to current employees as a retention tool 
the majority of these awards have three year cliff vesting terms and employees must fulfill service requirements in exchange for the right to the awards 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis from the grant date over the requisite service period 
employees forfeit unvested shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded 
retention grants and inducement grants are subject to ratable vesting based upon a five year service requirement and are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis from the grant date over the requisite service period 
employees forfeit unvested retention shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded 

table of contents performance based restricted stock awards granted in and cliff vest upon meeting a specific performance based metric prior to may performance grants are amortized on a straight line basis over the period we expect the performance target to be met 
the performance condition must be met for the awards to vest and total compensation cost will be recognized only if the performance condition is satisfied 
the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved and that the awards will vest is reevaluated each reporting period with changes in actual or estimated outcomes accounted for using a cumulative effect adjustment to compensation expense 
in the third quarter of  we deemed it improbable that the performance condition related to the performance grants would be met 
as a result  we recorded a million cumulative effect compensation expense reversal in the third quarter of as of december   we continue to believe it is improbable that the performance condition will be met prior to the expiration of the award 
stock based compensation granted to our non employee directors is in the form of unrestricted common shares of piper jaffray companies stock 
the stock based compensation paid to directors is immediately expensed and is included in our results of operations as outside services expense as of the grant date 
we granted stock options in fiscal years through the options were expensed on a straight line basis over the required service period  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model required management to exercise judgment with respect to certain assumptions  including the expected dividend yield  the expected volatility  and the expected life of the options 
as described above pertaining to our annual grants of restricted shares  stock options granted to employees were expensed in the calendar year preceding the annual february grant 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  established reserves for potential losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  contingencies  to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties regarding timing  size  volume and outcome of pending and potential legal proceedings and other factors  the amounts of reserves are difficult to determine and of necessity subject to future revision 
income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return  which includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries 
we also are subject to income tax in various states and municipalities and those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
amounts provided for income taxes are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in reporting certain items  principally  amortization of share based compensation 
the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recognized to the extent that it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we believe that 
table of contents our future taxable profits will be sufficient to recognize our us deferred tax assets 
however  if our projections of future taxable profits do not materialize  we may conclude that a valuation allowance is necessary  which would impact our results of operations in that period 
given our hong kong subsidiary s current level of cumulative losses and the deterioration in the asian capital markets  we have recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million as of december   representing the entire deferred tax asset  related to our hong kong subsidiary s net operating loss carryforwards 
we previously recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to our uk subsidiary s net operating loss carryforwards 
in the third quarter of  we reversed million of the uk subsidiary s deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on current year profitability and projected future earnings 
we record deferred tax benefits for future tax deductions expected upon the vesting of share based compensation 
if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation ie  the value of the share based compensation at the time of vesting exceed the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting ie  the grant date fair value of the compensation computed in accordance with asc  we record the excess tax benefit as additional paid in capital 
conversely  if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation are less than the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting  we offset the deficiency first to any previously recognized excess tax benefits recorded as additional paid in capital and any remaining deficiency is recorded as income tax expense 
as of december   we did not have any available excess tax benefits within additional paid in capital 
approximately  shares vested in the first quarter of at values less than the grant date fair value resulting in million of income tax expense in the first quarter of we establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes  when it is not more likely than not that a certain position or component of a position will be ultimately upheld by the relevant taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
our tax provision and related accruals include the impact of estimates for uncertain tax positions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
to the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes  such change in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period of change and  in turn  our results of operations 
liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity is of critical importance to us given the nature of our business 
insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances contributes to  and may be the cause of  financial institution failure 
accordingly  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions  and we have implemented a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances  although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances 
the majority of our tangible assets consist of assets readily convertible into cash 
financial instruments and other inventory positions owned are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable in most market conditions 
receivables and payables with customers and brokers and dealers usually settle within a few days 
as part of our liquidity strategy  we emphasize diversification of funding sources to the extent possible and maximize our lower cost financing alternatives 
our assets are financed by our cash flows from operations  equity capital  and other funding arrangements 
the fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities are directly related to daily operating activities from our various businesses 
one of our most important risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet 
while our asset base changes due to client activity  market fluctuations and business opportunities  the size and composition of our balance sheet reflect our overall risk tolerance  our ability to access stable funding sources and the amount of equity capital we hold 

table of contents the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents  or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash  marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time balance at december  average balance for the twelve months ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash in banks money market investments total cash and cash equivalents average balance calculated based upon ending daily balances 
in addition  we had cash and cash equivalents segregated of million and million that was available exclusively for customer liabilities included on our balance sheet as of december  and  respectively 
this cash and cash equivalents segregated consists of deposits in accordance with rule c of the securities exchange act of  which subjects piper jaffray co  our us broker dealer subsidiary carrying client accounts  to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of our clients 
a portion of these financial instruments are held within our regulated entities and our ability to transfer these financial instruments out of our regulated entities is limited by net capital requirements that apply to those entities only 
our regulated entities could seek regulatory approval to dividend these financial instruments to the parent for liquidity purposes  however  this could curtail our revenue producing activities within our regulated entities if it reduced our net capital 
certain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our inventory positions  requiring us to hold larger inventory positions for longer than expected or requiring us to take other actions that may adversely impact our results 
a significant component of our employees compensation is paid in annual discretionary incentive compensation 
the timing of these incentive compensation payments  which generally are made in february  has a significant impact on our cash position and liquidity 
we currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we have a bank syndicated credit agreement  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  and it includes a restrictive covenant that restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in shares of our common stock through september  in  we repurchased  shares or million of our common stock related to this authorization 
based upon prior repurchases  million of this authorization remained available as of december  our bank syndicated credit agreement includes a covenant that limits the annual amount of common shares we can repurchase to the amount of new equity granted during that fiscal year 
we also purchase shares of common stock from restricted stock award recipients upon the award vesting as recipients sell shares to meet their employment tax obligations 
during  we purchased approximately  common shares for this purpose 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from december  operating activities provided million of cash 
late in  to manage risk due to volatile market conditions  we reduced long inventory balances  which increased our cash position 
this reduction in long inventory 
table of contents resulted in a decreased receivable related to unsettled inventory trades  which provided additional cash flow 
the reduction in long inventory also allowed us to reduce our short inventory hedges  which resulted in a decrease of our securities purchased under agreements to resell  when compared to december  partially offsetting these increases in cash was a decrease in operating liabilities  particularly related to accrued compensation and other liabilities and accrued expenses 
additionally  included in our net loss of million was a non cash goodwill charge of million 
investing activities in used million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was used through financing activities 
a significant portion of our funding needs are driven by the levels of long inventory positions 
as we lowered our levels of long inventory late in  it led to a reduction in funding needs  particularly related to repurchase agreements 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from december  operating activities used million of cash due to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
during  market conditions improved and as a result  we increased certain inventory balances to take advantage of opportunities in the market and to serve our clients 
investing activities in used million of cash  the majority of which related to our acquisition of ari 
cash of million was provided through financing activities  primarily an increase in repurchase agreements and issuance of commercial paper  offset in part by million utilized to repurchase common stock 
cash from financing activities was used to fund our acquisition of ari and increased levels of securities inventory 
additionally  we entered into a bank syndicated credit agreement in late  which provided million in financing that was used to repay the million in variable rate senior notes that were due on december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from december  operating activities used million of cash due primarily to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
in late  as the market environment improved  we began to bring our inventory to more normalized levels 
investing activities used million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was provided through financing activities due in part to the issuance of variable rate senior notes in the amount of million and commercial paper in the amount of million during the additional cash provided by the issuance of variable rate senior notes and commercial paper reduced the need to enter into repurchase agreements at december   resulting in an million decrease in cash inflows related to repurchase agreements 
additionally  million was utilized to repurchase common stock 
leverage ratios the following table presents total assets  adjusted assets  total shareholders equity and tangible shareholders equity with the resulting leverage ratios as of december  and dollars in thousands total assets deduct goodwill and intangible assets adjusted assets total shareholders equity deduct goodwill and intangible assets tangible shareholders equity leverage ratio adjusted leverage ratio leverage ratio equals total assets divided by total shareholders equity 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity 

table of contents adjusted assets and tangible shareholders equity are non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numeric measure of financial performance that includes adjustments to the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  or for which there is no specific gaap measure 
goodwill and intangible assets are subtracted from total assets and total shareholders equity in determining adjusted assets and tangible shareholders equity  respectively  as we believe that goodwill and intangible assets do not constitute operating assets which can be deployed in a liquid manner 
we view the resulting measure of adjusted leverage  also a non gaap financial measure  as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services companies 
our leverage ratio and adjusted leverage ratio decreased from december  to december  resulting from the impact of the goodwill impairment charge and commensurate with the decrease in our securities inventory 
funding and capital resources the primary goal of our funding activities is to ensure adequate funding over a wide range of market conditions 
given the mix of our business activities  funding requirements are fulfilled through a diversified range of short term and long term financing 
we attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
our ability to support increases in total assets is largely a function of our ability to obtain funding from external sources 
access to these external sources  as well as the cost of that financing  is dependent upon various factors  including market conditions  the general availability of credit and credit ratings 
we currently do not have a credit rating  which could adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position by increasing our financing costs and limiting access to sources of liquidity that require a credit rating as a condition to providing the funds 
short term financing our day to day funding and liquidity is obtained primarily through the use of repurchase agreements  commercial paper issuance  and bank lines of credit  and is typically collateralized by our securities inventory 
these funding sources are critical to our ability to finance and hold inventory  which is a necessary part of our institutional brokerage business 
the majority of our inventory is very liquid and is therefore funded by overnight or short term facilities 
these short term facilities ie  our committed line  term repurchase agreement and commercial paper have been established to mitigate changes in the liquidity of our inventory based on changing market conditions 
our funding sources are also dependent on the types of inventory counterparties are willing to accept as collateral and the number of counterparties available 
from time to time the number of counterparties that will enter into municipal repurchase agreements can be limited based on market conditions 
currently  the majority of our bank lines and commercial paper will accept municipal inventory as collateral  which helps mitigate this municipal repurchase agreement counterparty risk 
we also have established arrangements to obtain financing by another broker dealer at the end of each business day related specifically to our convertible inventory 
funding is generally obtained at rates based upon the federal funds rate and or the london interbank offer rate 
uncommitted lines we use uncommitted lines in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under our uncommitted lines varies daily based on our funding needs 
our uncommitted secured lines total million with three banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral  as determined by the bank agreement  to secure an advance under the line 
collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under these secured lines 
we also have a million uncommitted unsecured facility with one of these banks 
all of these uncommitted lines are discretionary and are not a commitment by the bank to provide an advance under the line 
more specifically  these lines are subject to approval by the respective bank each time an advance is requested and advances may be denied  which may be particularly true during times of market stress or market perceptions of our exposures 
we manage our relationships with the banks that provide these uncommitted facilities in order to have appropriate levels of funding for our business 
at december   we had no advances against these lines of credit 

table of contents committed lines our committed line is a million revolving secured credit facility 
we use this credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under the facility varies daily based on our funding needs 
advances under this facility are secured by certain marketable securities 
the facility includes a covenant that requires piper jaffray co  our us broker dealer subsidiary  to maintain a minimum net capital of million  and the unpaid principal amount of all advances under the facility will be due on december  at december   we had no advances against this line of credit 
commercial paper program we issue secured commercial paper to approximately counterparties as of december  to fund a portion of our securities inventories 
the maximum amount that may be issued under the program is million  of which million was outstanding at december  the commercial paper notes are secured by our securities inventory with maturities on the commercial paper ranging from days to days from the date of issuance

suntrust bank is the administrative agent agent for the lenders 
the term loan amortizes percent in year one  percent in year two and percent in year three 
as of december   million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility  and million was outstanding on the amortizing term loan 
of the remaining term loan principal outstanding  we are required to pay million in and the remaining million in the credit agreement includes customary events of default  including failure to pay principal when due or failure to pay interest within three business days of when due  failure to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement and related documents  failure to pay or another event of default under other material indebtedness in an amount exceeding million  bankruptcy or insolvency of the company or any of our subsidiaries  a change in control of the company or a failure of piper jaffray co 
to extend  renew or refinance our existing million committed revolving secured credit facility on substantially the same terms as the existing committed facility 
if there is any event of default under the credit agreement  the agent may declare the entire principal and any accrued interest on the loans under the credit agreement to be due and payable and exercise other customary remedies 
the credit agreement includes covenants that  among other things  limit our leverage ratio  require maintenance of certain levels of cash and regulatory net capital  require our asset management segment to achieve minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and impose certain limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and to repurchase or declare dividends on our capital stock 
the credit agreement limits annual share repurchases to the amount of equity granted in conjunction with our annual equity compensation awards 
with respect to the net capital covenant  our us broker dealer subsidiary is required to maintain minimum net capital of million 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes the contractual amounts at december   in total and by remaining maturity 
excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including secured financing transactions  trading liabilities  short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities 
dollars in millions through through and thereafter total operating lease obligations purchase commitments investment commitments a loan commitments b bank syndicated credit agreement a the investment commitments have no specified call dates  however  the investment period for these funds is through the timing of capital calls is based on market conditions and investment opportunities 
b we may commit to merchant banking financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite debt 
we are unable to estimate the timing on the funding of these commitments and have no commitments outstanding at this time 

table of contents purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase commitments with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase commitments contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 
the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligation table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
capital requirements as a registered broker dealer and member firm of finra  our us broker dealer subsidiary is subject to the uniform net capital rule of the sec and the net capital rule of finra 
we have elected to use the alternative method permitted by the uniform net capital rule  which requires that we maintain minimum net capital of the greater of million or percent of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions  as this is defined in the rule 
finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying dividends if resulting net capital would be less than percent of aggregate debit balances 
advances to affiliates  repayment of subordinated liabilities  dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are subject to certain notification and other provisions of the uniform net capital rules 
we expect that these provisions will not impact our ability to meet current and future obligations 
we also are subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital from our broker dealer subsidiary 
at december   our net capital under the sec s uniform net capital rule was million  and exceeded the minimum net capital required under the sec rule by million 
although we operate with a level of net capital substantially greater than the minimum thresholds established by finra and the sec  a substantial reduction of our capital would curtail many of our capital markets revenue producing activities 
piper jaffray ltd  our broker dealer subsidiary registered in the united kingdom  is subject to the capital requirements of the uk financial services authority 
each of our piper jaffray asia entities licensed by the hong kong securities and futures commission is subject to the liquid capital requirements of the securities and futures financial resources rule promulgated under the securities and futures ordinance 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we enter into various types of off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements at december  and expiration per period at december  total contractual amount dollars in thousands later december  december  customer matched book derivative contracts trading securities derivative contracts credit default swap index contracts foreign currency forward contracts private equity investment commitments consists of interest rate swaps 
we have minimal market risk related to these matched book derivative contracts  however  we do have counterparty risk with two major financial institutions  which is mitigated by collateral deposits 
in addition  we have a limited number of counterparties contractual amount of million at december  who are not required to post collateral 
based on market movements  the uncollateralized amounts representing the fair value of the derivative contracts could become material  exposing us to the credit risk of these counterparties 
at december   we had million of credit exposure with these counterparties  including million of credit exposure with one counterparty 
we believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional or contract amount overstates the expected payout 
at december  and  the net fair value of these derivative contracts approximated million and million  respectively 
we have committed capital of million to certain entities  typically partnerships 
certain of these commitments have no specific call date 
derivatives derivatives notional contract amounts are not reflected as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
rather  the fair value of the derivative transactions are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as assets or liabilities in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  as applicable 
derivatives are reported on a net basis by counterparty when a legal right of offset exists and on a net basis by cross product when applicable provisions are stated in a master netting agreement 
we enter into derivative contracts in a principal capacity as a dealer to satisfy the financial needs of clients 
we also use derivative products to hedge the interest rate and market value risks associated with our security positions 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
for a complete discussion of our activities related to derivative products  see note  financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments we may commit to bridge loan financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite corporate debt 
we had no loan commitments outstanding at december  
table of contents private equity and other principal investments a component of our private equity and principal investments are made through investments in various legal entities  typically partnerships or limited liability companies  established for the purpose of investing in securities of public or private companies or municipal debt obligations 
we commit capital or act as the managing partner of these entities 
some of these entities are deemed to be variable interest entities 
for a complete discussion of our activities related to these types of entities  see note  variable interest entities  to our consolidated financial statements 
we have committed capital to certain entities and these commitments generally have no specified call dates 
we had million of commitments outstanding at december  other off balance sheet exposure our other types of off balance sheet arrangements include contractual commitments 
for a discussion of our activities related to these off balance sheet arrangements  see note  contingencies  commitments and guarantees  to our consolidated financial statements 
enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business 
in the course of conducting business operations  we are exposed to a variety of risks 
market risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal  regulatory and compliance risk  and reputational risk are the principal risks we face in operating our business 
we seek to identify  assess and monitor each risk in accordance with defined policies and procedures 
the extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
with respect to market risk and credit risk  the cornerstone of our risk management process is daily communication among traders  trading department management and senior management concerning our inventory positions and overall risk profile 
our risk management functions supplement this communication process by providing their independent perspectives on our market and credit risk profile on a daily basis 
the broader goals of our risk management functions are to understand the risk profile of each trading area  to consolidate risk monitoring company wide  to assist in implementing effective hedging strategies  to articulate large trading or position risks to senior management  and to ensure accurate mark to market pricing 
in addition to supporting daily risk management processes on the trading desks  our risk management functions support our financial risk committee 
this committee oversees risk management practices  including defining acceptable risk tolerances and approving risk management policies 
risk management techniques  processes and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk  and any risk management failures could expose us to material unanticipated losses 
market risk market risk represents the risk of financial volatility that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary for our clients  to our market making activities and our proprietary activities 
market risks are inherent to both cash and derivative financial instruments 
the scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market sensitive financial instruments 
our different types of market risk include interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates  
table of contents changes in the shape of the yield curve  changes in credit spreads  and the rate of prepayments on our interest earning assets including client cash balances  investments  inventories  and resale agreements and our funding sources including client cash balances  short term and bank syndicated financing  and repurchase agreements  which finance these assets 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of appropriate hedging in us government securities  agency securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  interest rate swaps  options  futures and forward contracts 
we utilize interest rate swap contracts and mmd rate lock agreements to hedge a portion of our fixed income inventory 
these interest rate swap contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
equity price risk equity price risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level or volatility of equity prices 
we are exposed to equity price risk through our trading activities in the us market on both listed and over the counter equity markets 
we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our market making and in our inventory of equity securities by establishing limits on the notional level of our inventory and by managing net position levels within those limits 
currency risk currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of non us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of operations or a foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to other comprehensive income within the shareholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 
value at risk value at risk var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we perform a daily var analysis on substantially all of our trading positions  including fixed income  equities  convertible bonds  exchange traded options  and all associated economic hedges 
these positions encompass both customer related activities and proprietary investments 
we use a var model because it provides a common metric for assessing market risk across business lines and products 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of risk exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes and individual securities 
we use a monte carlo simulation methodology for var calculations 
we believe this methodology provides var results that properly reflect the risk profile of all our instruments  including those that contain optionality  and also accurately models correlation movements among all of our asset classes 
in addition  it provides improved tail results as there are no assumptions of distribution  and can provide additional insight for scenario shock analysis 
model based var derived from simulation has inherent limitations including reliance on historical data to predict future market risk  var calculated using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the modeling of the market risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table quantifies the model based var simulated for each component of market risk for the periods presented computed using the past days of historical data 
when calculating var we use a percent confidence level and a one day time horizon 
this means that  over time  there is a in chance that daily 
table of contents trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual losses occurring on any given day arising from changes in market conditions will not exceed the var amounts shown below or that such losses will not occur more than once in a day trading period 
at december  dollars in thousands interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
we view average var over a period of time as more representative of trends in the business than var at any single point in time 
the table below illustrates the daily high  low and average value at risk calculated for each component of market risk during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
because high and low var numbers for these risk categories may have occurred on different days  high and low numbers for diversification benefit would not be meaningful 
trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on occasions during the aggregate var as of december  was higher compared to levels reported as of december  although fixed income inventories were lower from those on december   equity inventories were higher when compared to a year ago  driving the modest increase in var at the end of in addition to var  we also employ additional measures to monitor and manage market risk exposure including the following net market position  duration exposure  option sensitivities  and inventory turnover 
all metrics are aggregated by asset concentration and are used for monitoring limits and exception approvals 

table of contents liquidity risk market risk can be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
depending on the specific security  the structure of the financial product  and or overall market conditions  we may be forced to hold a security for substantially longer than we had planned 
our inventory positions subject us to potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk in our day to day funding activities 
we have a relatively low leverage ratio of and adjusted leverage ratio of as of december   as discussed above 
we manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products 
for example  our treasury department actively manages the use of our committed bank line  repurchase agreements  commercial paper issuance and secured and unsecured bank borrowings each day depending on pricing  availability of funding  available collateral and lending parameters from any one of these sources 
in addition to managing our capital and funding  the treasury department oversees the management of net interest income risk and the overall use of our capital  funding  and balance sheet 
we currently act as the remarketing agent for approximately billion of variable rate demand notes  all of which have a financial institution providing a liquidity guarantee 
at certain times  demand from buyers of variable rate demand notes is less than the supply generated by sellers of these instruments 
in times of supply and demand imbalance  we may but are not obligated to facilitate liquidity by purchasing variable rate demand notes from sellers for our own account 
our liquidity risk related to variable rate demand notes is ultimately mitigated by our ability to tender these securities back to the financial institution providing the liquidity guarantee 
credit risk credit risk in our business arises from potential non performance by counterparties  customers  borrowers or issuers of securities we hold in our trading inventory 
the global credit crisis also has created increased credit risk  particularly counterparty risk  as the interconnectedness of the financial markets has caused market participants to be impacted by systemic pressure  or contagion  that results from the failure or potential failure of market participants 
we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring position limits for each counterparty  monitoring trading counterparties  conducting credit reviews of financial counterparties  and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
we have concentrated counterparty credit exposure with six non publicly rated entities totaling million at december  this counterparty credit exposure is part of our derivative program  consisting primarily of interest rate swaps 
one derivative counterparty represents percent  or million  of this exposure 
credit exposure associated with our derivative counterparties is driven by uncollateralized market movements in the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts and is monitored regularly by our financial risk committee 
we attempt to minimize the credit or repayment risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by senior management 
we are exposed to credit risk in our role as a trading counterparty to dealers and customers  as a holder of securities and as a member of exchanges and clearing organizations 
our client activities involve the execution  settlement and financing of various transactions 
client activities are transacted on a delivery versus payment  cash or margin basis 
our credit exposure to institutional client business is mitigated by the use of industry standard delivery versus payment through depositories and clearing banks 
credit exposure associated with our customer margin accounts in the us and hong kong is monitored daily 
our risk management functions have credit risk policies establishing appropriate credit limits and collateralization thresholds for our customers utilizing margin lending 

table of contents merchant banking debt investments that have been funded are recorded in other assets at amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
at december   we had three funded merchant banking debt investments totaling million 
merchant banking investments are monitored regularly by our financial risk committee 
our risk management functions review risk associated with institutional counterparties with whom we hold repurchase and resale agreement facilities  stock borrow or loan facilities  derivatives  tbas and other documented institutional counterparty agreements that may give rise to credit exposure 
counterparty levels are established relative to the level of counterparty ratings and potential levels of activity 
we are subject to credit concentration risk if we hold large individual securities positions  execute large transactions with individual counterparties or groups of related counterparties  extend large loans to individual borrowers or make substantial underwriting commitments 
concentration risk can occur by industry  geographic area or type of client 
potential credit concentration risk is carefully monitored through review of counterparties and borrowers and is managed through the use of policies and limits 
we also are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in the credit spreads of debt instruments 
credit spread risk arises from potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or the market s perception of the issuer s credit worthiness 
we use credit default swap index contracts to mitigate this risk 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or from external events 
we rely on the ability of our employees  our internal systems and processes and systems at computer centers operated by third parties to process a large number of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of our systems or processes or improper action by our employees or third party vendors  we could suffer financial loss  a disruption of our businesses  regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation 
we have business continuity plans in place that we believe will cover critical processes on a company wide basis  and redundancies are built into our systems as we have deemed appropriate 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operations policies and procedures are being followed and that our various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
legal  regulatory and compliance risk legal  regulatory and compliance risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk that a counterparty s performance obligations will be unenforceable 
we are generally subject to extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
we have established procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements  including  but not limited to  those related to regulatory net capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  credit extension  money laundering  privacy and recordkeeping 
we have established internal policies relating to ethics and business conduct  and compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  as well as training and other procedures designed to ensure that these policies are followed 
reputation and other risk we recognize that maintaining our reputation among clients  investors  regulators and the general public is critical 
maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors  including the conduct of our business activities and the types of clients and counterparties with whom we conduct business 
we seek to maintain our reputation by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical standards and performing appropriate reviews of clients and counterparties 

table of contents other risks include political  regulatory and tax risks 
these risks reflect the potential impact that changes in local and international laws and tax statutes have on the economics and viability of current or future transactions 
in an effort to mitigate these risks  we review new and pending regulations and legislation 
effects of inflation because our assets are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as employee compensation  office space leasing costs and communications charges  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services we offer to our clients 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations
