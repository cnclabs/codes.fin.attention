deposits 
we offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
we currently offer passbook and statement savings accounts  interest bearing transaction accounts  checking accounts  money market accounts and time deposits 
we also offer ira accounts and qualified retirement plans 
deposit flows are influenced significantly by general and local economic conditions  changes in prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits and competition 
in determining our deposit rates  we consider local competition  us treasury securities offerings and the rates charged on other sources of funds 
our deposits are primarily obtained from market areas surrounding our branch offices 
we also open deposit accounts through the internet for customers throughout the united states 
we rely primarily on paying competitive rates  providing strong customer service and maintaining long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits 
we do not use brokers to obtain deposits 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
there are large money center and regional financial institutions operating throughout our market area  and we also face strong competition from other community based financial institutions 
we grew our deposits by million in and by million in we have restrained our deposit growth in recent years due to low market interest rates impacting the yields available to us for mortgage related assets and investment securities total deposits increased million  or  during due primarily to a billion increase in our money market accounts 
this increase was partially offset by a billion decrease in our time deposits and a million decrease in savings and interest bearing transaction accounts 
total core deposits defined as non time deposit accounts represented approximately of total deposits as of december  compared with as of december  this increase is due to the growth in our money market accounts as a result of our favorable rates as compared to our competitors 
the aggregate balance in our time deposit accounts was billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  time deposits with remaining maturities of less than one year amounted to billion at december  compared with billion at december  these time deposits are scheduled to mature as follows billion with an average cost of in the first quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the second quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the third quarter of and billion with an average cost of in the fourth quarter of based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing rate

we have entered into agreements with selected brokers and the fhlb to repurchase securities sold to these parties 
these agreements are recorded as financing transactions as we have maintained effective control over the transferred securities

the obligations to repurchase the securities are reported as a liability in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the securities underlying the agreements are delivered to the party with whom each transaction is executed 
they agree to resell to us the same securities at the maturity or put date of the agreement 
we retain the right of substitution of the underlying securities throughout the terms of the agreements 
we have also obtained advances from the fhlb  which are generally secured by a blanket lien against our mortgage portfolio 
borrowings with the fhlb are generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned 
borrowed funds at december are summarized as follows principal weighted average rate principal weighted average rate dollars in thousands securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb other brokers total securities sold under agreements to repurchase advances from the fhlb total borrowed funds accrued interest payable

as a result  if interest rates were to decrease  or stay at current levels  these borrowings would probably not be put back to us and our average cost of existing borrowings would not decrease even as market interest rates decrease 
conversely  if interest rates increase above the market interest rate for similar borrowings  these borrowings would likely be put back to us at their next put date and our cost to replace these borrowings would increase 
since market interest rates have remained very low for an extended period of time  we have not had any lenders put borrowings back to us 
as a result  many of our quarterly putable borrowings have become putable within three months 
of the billion reported  billion  with a weighted average rate of  could be put back to the company during any three month period 
we believe  given current market conditions  that the likelihood that a significant portion of these borrowings would be put back to us will not increase substantially unless interest rates were to increase by at least basis points 
the bank completed the restructuring transaction in the first quarter of which resulted in the extinguishment of billion of structured putable borrowings with an average cost of 
the extinguishment of the borrowings in the restructuring transaction was funded by the sale of billion of securities with an average yield of and re borrowing billion of short term fixed maturity borrowings with an average cost of 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the bank extinguished billion of structured putable borrowings with a weighted average cost of 
the extinguishment of the borrowings was funded primarily by the company s existing cash position 
this cash position was the result of the calls of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  prepayments on mortgage related assets 
the loss on the extinguishment of debt from the restructuring transaction and the extinguishment of debt during the fourth quarter of  collectively referred to as the transactions  amounted to billion 
during the year ended december   we also modified billion of putable borrowings to fixed maturity borrowings thereby eliminating the put option and further reducing our interest rate risk 
our borrowings also include billion of one time putable borrowings that are a result of modifying quarterly putable borrowings in and we did not enter into any new repurchase agreements during the scheduled maturities and potential put dates of our borrowings as of december  are as follows borrowings by scheduled maturity date borrowings by earlier of scheduled maturity or next potential put date year principal weighted average rate principal weighted average rate dollars in thousands total

regulation of hudson city savings bank and hudson city bancorp general hudson city savings has been a federally chartered savings bank since january  when it converted from a new jersey chartered savings bank 
its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic under the deposit insurance fund dif 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the reform act 
pursuant to the reform act  on july   the ots effectively merged into the occ  with the occ assuming all functions and authority from the ots relating to federally chartered savings banks  and the frb assuming all functions and authority from the ots relating to savings and loan holding companies 
as a result  hudson city savings is now regulated  examined and supervised by the occ and hudson city bancorp is now regulated by the frb 
hudson city savings must file reports with the occ concerning its activities and financial condition  and must obtain regulatory approval from the occ prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the occ will conduct periodic examinations to assess hudson city savings compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the occ has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose an enforcement 
table of contents action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the occ that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and  if action is not taken by the occ  the fdic has the authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
similarly  hudson city bancorp is subject to frb regulation  examination  supervision  and reporting requirements 
we are also subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a federal savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the dif and depositors and other consumers 
the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in laws and regulations including laws concerning taxes  banking  securities  accounting and insurance  whether by the frb  occ  fdic or another government agency  or through legislation  could have a material adverse impact on hudson city bancorp and hudson city savings and their operations and shareholders 
certain of the regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to hudson city bancorp and hudson city savings are described below 
this description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on hudson city bancorp and hudson city savings and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
informal regulatory agreement memorandum of understanding 
on june   the bank and company each entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with our former regulator  the ots 
in accordance with the mou entered into by the bank the bank mou which is now enforceable by the occ  the bank has adopted and has implemented enhanced operating policies and procedures that will enable us to continue to a reduce our level of interest rate risk  b reduce our funding concentration  c diversify our funding sources  d enhance our liquidity position  e monitor and manage loan modifications and f maintain our capital position in accordance with our existing capital plan 
in addition  we agreed to implement an increased governance structure over compliance and risk management practices including the establishment of a risk committee of the board of directors 
in accordance with the mou entered into by the company the company mou which is now enforceable by the frb  the company must  among other things support the bank s compliance with the bank mou 
the company mou also requires the company to a provide notice to the regulators in accordance with published regulatory guidance prior to declaring a dividend to shareholders and b provide notice to and obtain written non objection from the regulators prior to the company incurring any debt outside the ordinary course of business 
the board and management are continuing to implement the items required by the bank mou and the company mou 
however  a finding by our regulators that the company or the bank failed to comply with the mou could result in additional regulatory scrutiny  constraints on our business  or formal enforcement action 
any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations  financial condition  growth or other aspects of our business 
regulatory reform 
on july   the president signed into law the reform act 
the reform act imposes new restrictions and extends the framework of regulatory oversight for financial institutions  including depository institutions 
among other things  the reform act requires enhanced prudential standards for bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets 
in addition  the reform act changed the jurisdictions of existing bank regulatory agencies and in particular transferred the regulation of federal savings associations from the ots to the occ  effective july  savings and loan holding companies are now regulated by the frb 
the new law also established an independent federal consumer protection bureau within the frb 
the following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the new law that affect hudson city bancorp and hudson city savings 

table of contents the following aspects of the reform act are related to the operations of hudson city savings the current prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed  effective july   deposit insurance is permanently increased to  and unlimited deposit insurance for noninterest bearing transaction accounts provided through december   deposit insurance assessment base calculation equals the depository institution s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period  and the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif increased to of estimated annual insured deposits or the comparable percentage of the assessment base 
the reform act also created the cfpb  which is authorized to supervise certain consumer financial services companies and insured depository institutions with more than billion in total assets for consumer protection purposes 
on july   the cfpb took over rulemaking responsibility for the federal consumer financial protection laws  such as the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the real estate settlement procedures act  and the truth in saving act  among others 
furthermore  the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority with respect to compliance with such federal consumer financial protections laws and regulations by institutions under its supervision and is authorized to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is  or has  engaged in conduct that violates the federal consumer financial laws 
investigations may be conducted jointly with the federal bank regulatory agencies  and the cfpb may bring an administrative enforcement proceeding or civil actions in federal district court 
as a new independent bureau within the frb  it is possible that the cfpb will focus more attention on consumers and may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies 
in addition  the reform act provides that the same standards for federal preemption of state consumer financial laws apply to both national banks and federal savings associations and eliminates the applicability of preemption to subsidiaries and affiliates of national banks and federal savings associations 
the reform act also includes provisions  subject to further rulemaking by the federal bank regulatory agencies  that may affect our future operations  including provisions that create minimum standards for the origination of mortgages  restrict proprietary trading by banking entities  and restrict the sponsorship of and investment in hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities 
we will not be able to determine the impact of these provisions until final rules are promulgated to implement these provisions and other regulatory guidance is provided interpreting these provisions 
in addition  as required by the reform act  the frb has adopted a rule that places restrictions on interchange fees applicable to debit card transactions and is thus expected to lower fee income generated from this source 
effective october   interchange fees on debit card transactions are limited to a maximum of cents per transaction plus basis points of the transaction amount 
a debit card issuer may recover an additional one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud related requirements prescribed by the frb 
also  the reform act mandates that certain companies periodically submit to the frb and fdic the plan of such company for rapid and orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of a material financial distress or failure 
as a complement to such requirement  in january  the fdic adopted a rule requiring an insured depository institution with billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingent plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure 
the rule requires institutions to develop and submit detailed plans demonstrating how such insured depository institutions could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership 
the first plan would be due to be submitted by to the fdic on or before july  whether we will be required to prepare a plan will depend on the size of our balance sheet prior to that date 

table of contents the following aspects of the financial reform and consumer protection act are related to the operations of hudson city bancorp authority over savings and loan holding companies transferred to the frb  leverage capital requirements and risk based capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and bank holding companies will be extended to thrift holding companies  and the federal deposit insurance act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries 
federally chartered savings bank regulation activity powers 
hudson city savings derives its lending  investment and other activity powers primarily from the home owners loan act  as amended  commonly referred to as hola  and the regulations of the occ thereunder 
under these laws and regulations  federal savings banks  including hudson city savings  generally may invest in real estate mortgages  consumer and commercial loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  a limit of of an association s capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  a limit of of an association s assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  a limit of of an association s assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  a limit of of assets on non conforming loans certain loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and a limit of the greater of of assets or an association s capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property 
hudson city savings may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for hudson city savings  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities 
capital requirements 
the occ capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks to meet three minimum capital ratios a tangible capital ratio  a if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent examination leverage core capital ratio and an total risk based capital ratio 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the occ takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary 
hudson city savings  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios that exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with hudson city savings risk profile 
generally  under existing risk based and leverage capital rules  banks  bank holding companies and savings associations collectively  banking organizations are required to deduct certain assets from tier capital  and though a banking organization is permitted to net any associated deferred tax liability against some of such assets prior to making the deduction from tier capital  such netting generally is not permitted for goodwill and other intangible assets arising from a taxable business combination 
in these cases  the full or gross carrying amount of the asset is deducted 
however  banking organizations may reduce the amount of goodwill arising from a taxable business combination that they may deduct from tier capital by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with that goodwill 
we have no deferred tax liabilities associated with goodwill and  as a result  the full amount of our goodwill is deducted from tier capital 

table of contents for banking organizations that elect to apply this rule  the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital would reflect the maximum exposure to loss in the event that the entire amount of goodwill is impaired or derecognized for financial reporting purposes 
a banking organization that reduces the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital by the amount of the deferred tax liability is not permitted to net this deferred tax liability against deferred tax assets when determining regulatory capital limitations on deferred tax assets 
at december   hudson city savings exceeded each of the applicable capital requirements as shown in the following table occ requirements bank actual minimum capital adequacy for classification as well capitalized amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands december  tangible capital n a n a leverage core capital total risk based capital december  tangible capital n a n a leverage core capital total risk based capital the reform act requires the federal banking agencies to establish consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies 
these requirements must be no less than those to which insured depository institutions are currently subject to 
as a result  by july we will become subject to consolidated capital requirements which we have not been subject to previously 
in addition  on september   the basel committee adopted the basel iii capital rules 
these rules  which will be phased in over a period of years  set new standards for common equity  tier and total capital  determined on a risk weighted basis 
the basel iii capital rules will be implemented through regulations issued by the federal banking agencies the agencies 
the impact on hudson city savings and hudson city bancorp of the reform act requirements and the basel iii rules cannot be determined at this time 
in accordance with the requirements of the reform act  in january  the occ issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  which would require national banks and federal savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than billion  such as hudson city savings  to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests 
under the proposed rule  the occ will provide institutions with a minimum of three economic scenarios  reflecting baseline  adverse  and severely adverse conditions 
using financial data as of september th of each year  we would be required to use the scenarios to calculate  for each quarter end within a nine quarter planning horizon  the impact of such scenarios on revenues  losses  loan loss reserves  and regulatory capital levels and ratios  taking into account all relevant exposures and activities 
on or before january of each year  we would be required to submit a report of the results of our stress test to the occ 
within days thereafter  we would be required to publish a summary of the results 
the proposed rule also would require each institution to establish and maintain a system of controls  oversight  and documentation  including policies and procedures  designed to ensure that the stress testing processes used by the institution are effective in meeting the requirements of the proposed rule 
in addition to the proposed rule  the occ anticipates issuing proposed guidance and procedures for scenario development for comment at a later date 

table of contents in june  the agencies also proposed guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than billion in total consolidated assets  such as hudson city savings 
the proposed guidance provides an overview of how a banking organization should structure its stress testing activities and ensure they fit into overall risk management 
the guidance outlines broad principles for a satisfactory stress testing framework and describes the manner in which stress testing should be employed as an integral component of risk management that is applicable at various levels of aggregation within a banking organization  as well as for contributing to capital and liquidity planning 
the occ expects that the annual stress tests required under the january proposed rule described above would be only one component of the broader stress testing activities to be conducted by banking organizations under the june proposed guidance 
interest rate risk 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  required that the agencies revise their risk based capital standards to take into account irr concentration of risk and the risks of non traditional activities 
previously  the ots monitored the irr of individual institutions through a variety of means  including an analysis of the change in net portfolio value npv 
in addition  ots thrift bulletin a provided guidance on the management of irr 
however  following the december  reporting period  the agencies will discontinue use of the ots npv irr model and  effective march   ots thrift bulletin a will be rescinded 
the occ regulations do not include a specific irr component of the risk based capital requirement 
however  the occ expects all federal savings associations to have an independent irr measurement process in place that measures both earnings and capital at risk  as described in the irr advisory and the irr policy statement each described below 
in june  the agencies adopted a joint agency policy statement on irr the irr policy statement 
the irr policy statement provides guidance to examiners and bankers on sound practices for managing irr 
the irr policy statement also outlines fundamental elements of sound management that have been identified in prior regulatory guidance and discusses the importance of these elements in the context of managing irr 
specifically  the guidance emphasizes the need for active board of director and senior management oversight and a comprehensive risk management process that effectively identifies  measures and controls irr 
in january  the agencies released an advisory on interest rate risk management the irr advisory to remind institutions of the supervisory expectations regarding sound practices for managing irr 
while some degree of irr is inherent in the business of banking  the agencies expect institutions to have sound risk management practices in place to measure  monitor and control irr exposures  and irr management should be an integral component of an institution s risk management infrastructure 
the agencies expect all institutions to manage their irr exposures using processes and systems commensurate with their earnings and capital levels  complexity  business model  risk profile and scope of operations  and the irr advisory reiterates the importance of effective corporate governance  policies and procedures  risk measuring and monitoring systems  stress testing  and internal controls related to the irr exposures of institutions 
the irr advisory encourages institutions to use a variety of techniques to measure irr exposure  including simple maturity gap analysis  income measurement and valuation measurement for assessing the impact of changes in market rates  as well as simulation modeling to measure irr exposure 
institutions are encouraged to use the full complement of analytical capabilities of their irr simulation models 
the irr advisory also reminds institutions that stress testing  which includes both scenario and sensitivity analysis  is an integral component of irr management 
the irr advisory indicates that institutions should regularly assess irr exposures beyond typical industry conventions  including changes in rates of greater magnitude eg  up and down and basis points  as compared to up and down basis points  which has been the general practice across different tenors to reflect changing slopes and twists of the yield curve 

table of contents the irr advisory emphasizes that effective irr management not only involves the identification and measurement of irr  but also provides for appropriate actions to control this risk 
the adequacy and effectiveness of an institution s irr management process and the level of its irr exposure are critical factors in the agencies evaluation of an institution s sensitivity to changes in interest rates and capital adequacy 
safety and soundness standards 
pursuant to the requirements of the fdicia  as amended by the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  the agencies adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director  or principal shareholder 
in addition  the occ adopted regulations pursuant to fdicia to require a savings bank that is given notice by the occ that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the occ 
if  after being so notified  a savings bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the occ may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
if a savings bank fails to comply with such an order  the occ may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties 
prompt corrective action 
fdicia established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
under this system  the bank regulators are required to take certain  and authorized to take other  supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions  based upon five categories of capitalization which fdicia created well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank s capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
the occ is required to monitor closely the condition of an undercapitalized bank and to restrict the growth of its assets 
an undercapitalized bank is required to file a capital restoration plan within days of the date the bank receives notices that it is within any of the three undercapitalized categories  and the plan must be guaranteed by every parent holding company 
the aggregate liability of a parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to five percent of the bank s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized  and the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the bank into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such bank as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
banks that are significantly or critically undercapitalized are subject to a wider range of regulatory requirements and restrictions 
under the occ regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater and its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the occ to meet a specific capital level 
as of december   hudson city savings met the applicable requirements to be considered well capitalized 

table of contents in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions with respect to undercapitalized institutions  insured banks and their holding companies may be subject to potential enforcement actions by their regulators for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their business or for violations of law or regulation  including the filing of a false or misleading regulatory report 
enforcement actions under this authority may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties generally bank insiders 
further  the frb may bring an enforcement action against a depository institution holding company either to address undercapitalization in the holding company or to require the holding company to take measures to remediate undercapitalization or other safety and soundness concerns in a depository institution subsidiary 
insurance activities 
hudson city savings is generally permitted to engage in certain activities through its subsidiaries 
however  the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations prohibiting depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity that is not affiliated with the depository institution 
the regulations also require prior disclosure of this prohibition to potential insurance product or annuity customers 
deposit insurance 
hudson city savings is a member of the dif and pays its deposit insurance assessments to the dif 
under the federal deposit insurance act  as amended fdia  the fdic may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of hudson city savings does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
under the fdic s risk based assessment system  the fdic assigns an institution to one of four risk categories  with the first category having two sub categories  based on the institution s most recent supervisory ratings and capital ratios 
for institutions within risk category i  assessment rates generally depend upon a combination of camels capital adequacy  asset quality  management  earnings  liquidity  sensitivity to market risk component ratings and financial ratios  or for large institutions with long term debt issuer ratings  assessment rates depend on a combination of long term debt issuer ratings  camels component ratings and financial ratios 
the fdic has the flexibility to adjust rates  without further notice and comment rulemaking  provided that no such adjustment can be greater than three basis points from one quarter to the next  that adjustments cannot result in rates more than three basis points above or below the base rates and that rates cannot be negative 
the fdic  which sets a designated reserve ratio drr annually  also established of estimated insured deposits as the drr of the dif 
in december  the fdic amended its regulations to increase the drr of the dif from to of estimated insured deposits of the dif effective january  in december  the fdic held the drr at for the fdic is authorized to change the assessment rates as necessary  subject to the previously discussed limitations  to maintain the drr 
as a result of the failures of a number of banks and thrifts  there has been a significant increase in the loss provisions of the dif 
this resulted in a decline in the dif reserve ratio during below the then minimum designated reserve ratio of 
as a result  the fdic was required to establish a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to within a period of five years  which was subsequently extended to eight years 
in order to restore the reserve ratio to  the fdic adopted a final rule in february which set the initial base assessment rates beginning april  and provided for the following adjustments to an institution s assessment rate a decrease for long term unsecured debt  including most senior and subordinated debt  an increase for secured liabilities above a threshold amount  and for non risk category i institutions  an increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount 

table of contents the reform act gave the fdic much greater discretion to manage the dif  including where to set the drr 
among other things  the reform act i raises the minimum drr  which the fdic is required to set each year  to from the former minimum of and removed the upper limit on the drr which was formerly capped at  ii requires that the fund reserve ratio reach by september   and iii requires that the fdic offset the effect of requiring the reserve ratio to reach on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion  so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio will be borne by the institutions with more than billion in assets  such as hudson city savings 
in october  the fdic adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the reform act 
among other things  the restoration plan provided that the fdic would forego a uniform three basis point increase in initial assessments rates that was previously scheduled to take effect on january  the fdic is expected to pursue further rulemaking regarding the method that will be used to reach the reserve ratio of so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to will be borne by institutions with more than billion in assets 
in accordance with the reform act  on february   the fdic adopted a final rule that redefines the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than on deposit bases  and adopts a new assessment rate schedule  as well as alternative rate schedules that become effective when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels

as discussed above  the reform act requires the agencies to establish consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies 
these requirements must be no less than those to which insured depository institutions are currently subject 
in addition  the reform act specifically authorizes the frb to issue regulations relating to capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies 
as a result  by july  we will become subject to consolidated capital requirements which we have not been subject to previously 
in addition  pursuant to the reform act  we are required to serve as a source of strength for hudson city savings 
as required by the reform act  in december of  the frb issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing several enhanced prudential standards to manage systemic risks presented by bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more and by nonbank financial institutions that are designated as systemically important by the financial stability oversight council  with respect to i risk based capital requirements and leverage limits  ii liquidity requirements  iii single counterparty credit limits  iv risk management  v stress tests  vi the debt to equity ceiling  and vii early remediation

in addition  we would be required to conduct semi annual stress tests 
a summary of both the frb run and the company run stress tests would be required to be published 
the stress test requirement is predicated on a company being subject to consolidated capital requirements and  therefore  the frb will delay effectiveness of this requirement for savings and loan holding companies until the frb has established risk based capital requirements for such institutions 
in general  savings and loan holding companies would not be subject to the requirements in the proposed rule  except for the stress test requirements described above 
however  the frb has indicated that it intends to issue a separate proposal to initially apply the enhanced prudential standards to savings and loan holding companies 
in addition  while the enhanced prudential standards under the proposed rule apply to institutions with more than billion in consolidated assets  certain provisions of the rule also apply to bank holding companies with more than billion in total consolidated assets and the frb has indicated that it may determine to apply any of the enhanced prudential standards to any savings and loan holding company  if appropriate to ensure the safety and soundness of such company  on a case by case basis

distributions 
to the extent that hudson city savings makes non dividend distributions to shareholders  such distributions will be considered to result in distributions from hudson city savings unrecaptured tax bad debt reserve base year reserve  ie  its reserve as of december   to the extent thereof and then from its supplemental reserve for losses on loans  and an amount based on the amount distributed will be included in hudson city savings taxable income 
non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of hudson city savings current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of hudson city savings current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in hudson city savings income 

table of contents the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is equal to the lesser of hudson city savings base year reserve and supplemental reserve for losses on loans or an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  in certain situations  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate 
hudson city savings does not intend to pay dividends that would result in the recapture of any portion of its bad debt reserve

risk factors our net interest margin may contract further in the current interest rate environment and changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during the first quarter of we completed the restructuring transaction which included the extinguishment of billion of structured putable borrowings funded by the sale of billion of securities and billion of new short term fixed maturity borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank extinguished billion of structured putable borrowings with a weighted average cost of 
the extinguishment of the borrowings in the fourth quarter of was funded primarily by the company s existing cash position 
this cash position was the result of the calls of investment securities and  to a lesser extent  prepayments on mortgage related assets 
the transactions were intended to reduce our level of interest rate risk and improve our net interest margin 
while net interest margin has improved from the levels that we would have experienced had we not completed the transactions  the current protracted low interest rate environment will result in a continued trend of net interest margin compression 
during this period of low market interest rates  elevated levels of prepayments and refinancings have resulted in a decrease in the yields earned on our interest earning assets while our interest bearing liabilities are repricing at a slower rate and include borrowings that are not expected to reprice in the near term 
in september  the fomc announced its plan to purchase billion of treasury securities with maturities of to years funded by the sale of an equal amount of treasury securities with remaining maturities of years or less in a program commonly referred to as operation twist 
this shift in security holdings by the frb is intended to put downward pressure on longer term interest rates 
the fomc also decided to maintain the overnight lending rate at zero to through at least we expect the actions commenced by the fomc will place additional downward pressure on our net interest margin as our interest earning assets re price to lower levels 
we are required to comply with the terms of the bank mou and the company mou that we have entered into with our regulators  and lack of compliance could result in additional regulatory enforcement actions 
the bank and the company each entered into a mou with our former regulator  the ots on june  in accordance with the bank mou  the bank has adopted and has implemented enhanced operating policies and procedures that will enable us to continue to a reduce our level of interest rate risk  b reduce our funding concentration  c diversify our funding sources  d enhance our liquidity position  e monitor and manage loan modifications and f maintain our capital position in accordance with our existing capital plan 
in addition  we agreed to implement an increased governance structure over compliance and risk management practices including the establishment of a risk committee of the board of directors 
implementation of the bank mou requirements has resulted in  and may continue to result in  increased non interest expense as we further enhanced our technology  added more staff to comply with such requirements and engaged outside consultants 
in accordance with the company mou  the company must  among other things support the bank s compliance with the bank mou 
the company mou also requires the company to a provide notice to the regulators in accordance with published regulatory guidance prior to declaring a dividend to shareholders and b provide notice to and obtain written non objection from the regulators prior to the company incurring any debt outside the ordinary course of business 

table of contents the board and management are continuing to implement the items required by the bank mou and the company mou 
a finding by our regulators that the company or the bank failed to comply with the mou could result in additional regulatory scrutiny  constraints on our business  or formal enforcement action 
any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our future operations  financial condition  growth or other aspects of our business 
our ability to originate mortgage loans for portfolio has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the unprecedented involvement of the us government and gses in the residential mortgage market 
over the past few years  we have faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the unprecedented involvement of the gses in the mortgage market 
this involvement is a result of the recent economic crisis and has caused the interest rate for thirty year fixed rate mortgage loans that conform to the gses loan purchase guidelines to remain exceptionally low 
in addition  the us congress has expanded the conforming loan limits in many of our operating markets  allowing larger balance loans to continue to be acquired by the gses 
we originate and purchase such conforming loans and retain them for portfolio 
in february  the market interest rates for gse conforming mortgage loans hit record lows 
as a portfolio lender  we limited the growth of our balance sheet since we did not believe it was prudent to reinvest in long term mortgage related assets at current market interest rates 
we expect that our one to four family loan repayments will remain at elevated levels and will continue to outpace our loan production as a result of these factors 
accordingly  we are likely to continue to experience a decrease in the size of our balance sheet while current economic conditions prevail 
the ultimate resolution of fannie mae and freddie mac may materially impact our results of operations 
both fannie mae and freddie mac are under conservatorship with the federal housing finance agency 
on february   the obama administration presented the us congress with a report of its proposals for reforming america s housing finance market with the goal of scaling back the role of the us government in  and promoting the return of private capital to  the mortgage markets and ultimately winding down fannie mae and freddie mac 
without mentioning a specific time frame  the report calls for the reduction of the role of fannie mae and freddie mac in the mortgage markets by  among other things  reducing conforming loan limits  increasing guarantee fees and requiring larger down payments by borrowers 
the report presents three options for the long term structure of housing finance  all of which call for the unwinding of fannie mae and freddie mac and a reduced role of the government in the mortgage market a system with us government insurance limited to a narrowly targeted group of borrowers  a system similar to above except with an expanded guarantee during times of crisis  and a system where the us government offers catastrophic reinsurance for the securities of a targeted range of mortgages behind significant private capital 
we cannot be certain if or when fannie mae and freddie mac will be wound down  if or when reform of the housing finance market will be implemented or what the future role of the us government will be in the mortgage market  and  accordingly  we will not be able to determine the impact that any such reform may have on us until a definitive reform plan is adopted 

table of contents the regulatory reform legislation that became effective in has created uncertainty and may have a material effect on our operations and capital requirements 
as a result of the financial crisis which occurred in the banking and financial markets commencing in the second half of  the overall bank regulatory climate is now marked by caution  conservatism and a renewed focus on compliance and risk management 
there are many provisions of the reform act which are to be implemented through regulations to be adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies within specified time frames following the effective date of the reform act  which creates a risk of uncertainty as to the effect that such provisions will ultimately have 
we believe the following provisions of the reform act will have an impact on us the elimination of our primary federal regulator  the ots  and the assumption by the occ of regulatory authority over all federal savings associations  such as hudson city savings  and the acquisition by the frb of regulatory authority over all savings and loan holding companies  such as hudson city bancorp  as well as all subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies other than depository institutions 
although the laws and regulations currently applicable to us generally will not change by virtue of the elimination of the ots except to the extent such laws have been modified by the reform act  the application of these laws and regulations may vary as administered by the occ and the frb 
the significant roll back of the federal preemption of state consumer protection laws that is currently enjoyed by federal savings associations and national banks 
as a result  we may now be subject to state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business  and those laws may be interpreted and enforced differently in different states 
the establishment of consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies  as discussed below 
the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the dif from to of insured deposits  which must be reached by september   and the requirement that deposit insurance assessments be based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than on deposit bases 
as a result of these provisions  our deposit insurance premiums have substantially increased 
effective april   hudson city savings may be subject to a new rule promulgated by the fdic which requires insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the fdic a contingent plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure 
for hudson city  the first plan would be due to be submitted by to the fdic on or before july  whether such plan will be required will depend on the size of our balance sheet prior to that date 
the reform act also includes provisions that create minimum standards for the origination of mortgage loans 
pursuant to the reform act  on april   the frb requested public comment on a proposed rule under regulation z that would impose extensive regulations governing an institution s obligation to evaluate a borrower s ability to repay a mortgage loan 
the rule would apply to all consumer mortgages except home equity lines of credit  timeshare plans  reverse mortgages or temporary loans 
consistent with the reform act  the proposal provides four options for complying with the ability to repay requirement 
the proposal would also implement the reform act s limits on prepayment penalties 
it is possible that this rule may require use to change our underwriting practices and may cause a further increase in compliance costs 

table of contents as a result of the reform act and other proposed changes  we may become subject to more stringent capital requirements and other enhanced prudential standards 
the reform act requires the federal banking agencies to establish consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies 
these requirements must be no less than those to which insured depository institutions are currently subject 
in addition  the reform act specifically authorizes the frb to issue regulations relating to capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies 
as a result  by july  we will become subject to consolidated capital requirements which we have not been subject to previously 
in addition  in december the basel committee on banking supervision announced the new basel iii capital rules  which set new standards for common equity  tier and total capital  determined on a risk weighted basis 
it is not yet known how these standards  which will be phased in over a period of years  will be implemented by us regulators generally or how they will be applied to financial institutions of our size 
also  as required by the reform act  in december of  the frb issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing several enhanced prudential standards to manage systemic risks presented by bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more and by nonbank financial institutions that are designated as systemically important by the financial stability oversight council  with respect to i risk based capital requirements and leverage limits  ii liquidity requirements  iii single counterparty credit limits  iv risk management  v stress tests  vi the debt to equity ceiling  and vii early remediation 
under the proposed rule  the enhanced prudential standards  other than the stress testing requirement  are not currently applicable to savings and loan holding companies 
however  the frb has indicated that it intends to issue a separate proposal to initially apply the enhanced prudential standards to savings and loan holding companies 
further  some of these standards are expected to apply to institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more 
our transition to the occ as hudson city savings primary banking regulator and the frb as our holding company regulator  as well as implementation of the many other provisions of the reform act  may increase our compliance costs 
on july   the ots was eliminated and the occ took over the regulation of all federal savings associations  including hudson city savings and the frb acquired the ots authority over all savings and loan holding companies  including hudson city bancorp 
consequently  we are now subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the occ and the frb  rather than the ots 
additionally  we have been advised by the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb that it will be supervising our compliance with consumer protection laws 
as a result of becoming subject to regulation by these three entities  in light of the overall enhanced regulatory scrutiny in our industry and in taking into consideration the requirements of the bank mou and company mou  we have decided to enhance various systems and add staff to keep up with the operational and regulatory burden associated with an institution of our size 
for example  we are developing a comprehensive enterprise risk management program and a comprehensive compliance management program 
these enhancements have resulted in additional investments in both technology and staffing that will increase our non interest expense 
moreover  as our new regulators adopt implementing regulations and guidance with respect to their supervision of federal savings banks  we may need to evaluate and modify various policies and procedures  further enhance our technology and add more staff to ensure continued compliance with this regulatory burden  which will further increase our non interest expense 

table of contents the reform act created a new consumer financial protection bureau  which may increase our costs of operations and compliance costs 
the reform act created the cfpb with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the cfpb has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the cfpb has examination and enforcement authority over all banks with more than billion in assets 
banks with billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators 
as a new independent bureau within the frb  it is possible that the cfpb will focus more attention on consumers and may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies  which at a minimum  could increase our operating and compliance costs 
we are subject to regulatory requirements and limitations that may impact our ability to pay future dividends 
we are a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the frb and almost all of our operating assets are owned by hudson city savings bank 
we rely primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to our shareholders and to engage in share repurchase programs 
the occ regulates all capital distributions by the bank directly or indirectly to us  including dividend payments 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  the bank must file a notice or seek affirmative approval from the occ at least days prior to each proposed capital distribution 
whether an application is required is based on a number of factors including whether the institution qualifies for expedited treatment under the occ rules and regulations or if the total amount of all capital distributions including each proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years 
currently  hudson city savings must seek approval from the occ for future capital distributions 
in addition  as the subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company  hudson city savings must also seek approval from the frb before declaring a dividend 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends to us if  after paying those dividends  it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the occ has notified the bank that it is in need of more than normal supervision 
under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia  an insured depository institution such as the bank is prohibited from making a capital distribution  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdia 
payment of dividends by the bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to pay dividends at past levels  or at all  in the future 
in addition to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit it makes to its affiliates and on investments in stock or other securities of its affiliates 
we are considered an affiliate of the bank 
these restrictions prevent affiliates of the bank  including us  from borrowing from the bank  unless various types of collateral secure the loans 
federal law limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in any single affiliate to of the bank s capital stock and surplus and also limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in all affiliates to of the bank s capital stock and surplus 
if we do not receive sufficient cash dividends or are unable to borrow from the bank  then we may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 

table of contents the reform act imposes further restrictions on transactions with affiliates and extensions of credit to executive officers  directors and principal shareholders  by  among other things  expanding covered transactions to include securities lending  repurchase agreement and derivatives activities with affiliates 
these changes are expected to become effective by july  pursuant to the terms of the company mou  we are required to file a notice with the frb at least days prior to declaring any future cash dividend  which notice must evidence our compliance with applicable guidance regarding payment of dividends issued by the frb 
this process will enable the frb to comment on  object to or otherwise prohibit us from paying the proposed dividend 
the supervisory guidance issued by the frb states that we should either eliminate  defer or significantly reduce dividends if i our net income available to common shareholders over the past year is insufficient to fully fund a dividend  ii our prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with our capital needs and our overall current or prospective financial condition or iii we will not meet  or are in danger of not meeting  our minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
declines in the market value of our common stock may have a material effect on the value of our reporting unit which could result in a goodwill impairment charge and adversely affect our results of operations 
at december   the carrying amount of our goodwill totaled million 
we performed a goodwill impairment test on december  and determined there was no goodwill impairment 
due to market volatility during  we experienced a decline in our market capitalization 
our market capitalization continues to be less than our total stockholders equity at december  we considered this and other factors in our goodwill impairment analyses 
no assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in a subsequent period 
however  our tangible capital ratio and hudson city savings regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential non cash expense 
the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 
originating loans secured by residential real estate is our primary business 
our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  either nationally or in our local new jersey and metropolitan new york market areas  including the level of short term and long term interest rates  decreases in real estate values  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government  the strength of the economy in the united states generally and in the company s market area in particular  and other significant external events 
as a result of our lending practices  we have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
at december   approximately of our total loans are residential first mortgage loans and approximately of our total loans are in the new york metropolitan area 
financial institutions continue to be affected by the sharp declines in the real estate market that occurred over the last three years as well as the effects of the recent recessionary economy 
declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  decreases in real estate values have adversely affected the value of property used as collateral for our loans and result in higher loss experience on our non performing loans 
adverse changes in the economy  particularly in employment conditions  may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
as a result of the concentration of loans in the new york metropolitan area  a prolonged or more severe downturn in the local economy could result in 
table of contents significant increases in nonperforming loans  which would negatively affect the company s interest income and result in higher provisions for loan losses  which would hurt the company s earnings 
if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans  our profits may decrease because our investment alternatives may earn less income for us than real estate loans 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of our business activities 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the frb  the occ  the cfpb and the fdic 
as a result  we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and our depositors  as well as other consumers  and not to benefit our shareholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  we must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 
as a result of the recent financial crisis which occurred in the banking and financial markets  the overall bank regulatory climate is now marked by caution  conservatism and a renewed focus on compliance and risk management 
non performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets adversely affect the company s net earnings in various ways 
the company expects to continue to have a provision for loan losses relating to non performing loans that is higher than its historical experience 
the company generally does not record interest income on non performing loans or other real estate owned  thereby reducing its earnings  while its loan administration costs are higher for non performing loans 
when the company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  the company is required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral  which may ultimately result in a loss 
until the recent recessionary cycle  it was our experience that as a non performing loan approached foreclosure  the borrower sold the underlying property or  if there was a second mortgage or other subordinated lien  the subordinated lien holder would purchase the property to protect their interest thereby resulting in the full payment of principal and interest to hudson city savings 
this process normally took approximately months 
however  due to the unprecedented level of foreclosures and the desire by most states to slow the foreclosure process  we are now experiencing a time frame to repayment or foreclosure ranging from to months from the initial non performing period 
given the delays in foreclosures in our market area  the level of our non performing assets is expected to continue to increase 
an increase in the level of non performing assets increases the company s risk profile and may affect the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate 
at december  our non performing loans amounted to billion or of total loans as compared to million or of total loans at december  and our charge offs amounted to million for as compared to million in there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future increases in non performing assets 
recent occ guidance regarding mortgage foreclosure processes and an occ mandated self assessment may increase our compliance costs and could impact our foreclosure process 
several of the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers have experienced highly publicized issues with respect to their foreclosure processes 
in light of these issues  on june   the occ issued supervisory guidance regarding the occ s expectations for the oversight and management of mortgage foreclosure activities by banks engaged in mortgage servicing  such as hudson city  to ensure that mortgage servicers comply with foreclosure laws  conduct foreclosure processing in a safe and sound manner and establish responsible business practices that provide accountability and appropriate treatment of borrowers in the foreclosure process 

table of contents the occ s supervisory guidance requires that the bank conduct a self assessment of foreclosure management policies  including compliance with legal requirements  testing and file reviews and to take immediate corrective action with respect to any identified weaknesses in their foreclosure processes 
as part of the self assessment we are also required to determine if such weaknesses resulted in any financial harm to borrowers and provide remediation where appropriate 
compliance with the occ s supervisory guidance and the mandated self assessment is likely to increase our non interest expense 
in addition  while we do not believe that there are any material weaknesses in our foreclosure process or that our borrowers experienced any financial harm  we may be required to enhance our policies and procedures to meet heightened standards and restrictions not currently set forth in any statutory laws or regulations
