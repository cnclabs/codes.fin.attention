overview heartland express  inc is a short to medium haul truckload carrier with corporate headquarters in north liberty  iowa 
the company provides regional dry van truckload services through its regional terminals and its corporate headquarters 
the company transports freight for major shippers and generally earns revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered 
the company s eleven regional operating divisions  not including operations at the corporate headquarters  accounted for  and of the operating revenues for the year ended december   and  respectively 
the company takes pride in the quality of the service that it provides to its customers 
the company believes the keys to maintaining a high level of service are the availability of late model equipment and experienced drivers 
operating efficiencies and cost controls are achieved through equipment utilization  operating a fleet of late model equipment  maintaining an industry leading driver to non driver employee ratio  and the effective management of fixed and variable operating costs 
during industry capacity tightened and demand for freight services has increased in although current freight volumes are still below volumes experienced prior to the recent recession 
the tightening capacity in the industry with an increase in freight volumes  compared to  allowed for stabilization and certain improvements in freight rates in late which continued throughout the company has experienced increasing difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers 
the company continues to be challenged by a shrinking pool of qualified drivers 
competition for drivers  which is always intense  escalated during due to general improvements in the demand for freight services 
as fuel prices soared to historical highs during  containment of fuel cost became a top priority of management 
the company continues to implement fuel initiative strategies to effectively manage fuel costs since that time 
these initiatives included strategic fueling of our trucks whether it be terminal fuel or over the road fuel  reduction of tractor idle time  controlling out of route miles  trailer skirting  and increased fuel economy through the purchase of newer more fuel efficient tractors 
these initiatives continued to prove beneficial throughout the company continues to be challenged by increased fuel prices and anticipates that fuel prices will remain at or above current levels 
average diesel fuel prices increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for  the company s net fuel cost per mile fuel expense less fuel surcharge revenue not passed on to owner operators over company driver miles increased 
average diesel fuel prices during january and february have been approximately higher than average fuel prices at the end of the company is not able to pass through all fuel price increases through fuel surcharge agreements with customers due to empty and out of route miles 
the company continues to focus on fuel surcharge pricing  truck idling hours  and fuel purchasing decisions in an effort to lessen the impact of higher fuel costs 
at december   of the company s tractor fleet is equipped with idle management controls 
at december   the company s tractor fleet had an average age of years which is slightly lower than an average age of at december  the company has continued to upgrade its trailer fleet during taking advantage of a robust used trailer market 
at december   the company s trailer fleet had an average age of years compared to as of december  and is expected to improve throughout based on the company s commitment to replace certain older trailers with new trailers throughout the company continues to focus on growing internally by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in the company s regional operating areas 
in addition to the development of its regional operating centers  the company has made five acquisitions since we believe our commitment to quality service allowed the company to hold its freight rates relatively stable throughout the recent recession  in comparison to our competitors  better positioning the company for future growth as market capacity continues to tighten 
future growth is dependent upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand  the available capacity in the trucking industry  potential acquisition opportunities  and the availability and ability to attract and retain experienced drivers that meet our hiring standards 
the company hires only experienced drivers minimum year of driving experience with safe driving records 
in order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service  the company has sought to solidify its position as an industry leader in driver compensation in the company s operating markets 
the company offers the top or near the top compensation pay per mile to drivers in the markets in which the company operates 
the company became publicly traded in november  and is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol htld 
the company has been recognized as one of the forbes magazine s best small companies in america eighteen times in the past twenty five years and for eight of the past ten years as well as being awarded logistics management magazine quest for quality award for the ninth straight year as well as bp lubricants usa safe driving award for the past five consecutive years

the company has paid cash dividends over the past thirty four consecutive quarters  including special dividends of million in may of and million in october of in addition the company has paid approximately million to repurchase million shares through stock repurchases over the past five years 
the company ended the year of with operating revenues of million  including fuel surcharges  net income of million  and basic earnings per share of on basic weighted average outstanding shares of million compared to operating revenues of million  including fuel surcharges  net income of million  and basic earnings per share of on basic weighted average shares of million in the company posted an operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of and a net margin net income as a percentage of operating revenues for compared to in same period of the company had total assets of million at december  the company achieved a return on assets of and a return on equity of over the immediate past four quarters ended december  the company s cash flow from operations for the twelve months ended december  of million was of operating revenues compared to million and in the company used million in net investing cash flows  mainly due to the purchases of revenue equipment net of proceeds from equipment sales  as the company upgraded its tractor and trailer fleet during the year  and further offset by calls of auction rate securities during the year  at par 
the company used million in financing activities mainly related to repurchases of common stock as well as dividend payments during the year ended december  as a result  the company increased cash and cash equivalents million during the year ended december  the company ended with cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million and a debt free balance sheet 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total operating revenue for the periods indicated year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and benefits rent and purchased transportation fuel operations and maintenance operating taxes and license insurance and claims communications and utilities depreciation other operating expenses gain on disposal of property and equipment operating income interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income year ended december  compared with the year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was mainly the result of a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue from million in to million in line haul and other revenues decreased million on a decrease in total miles  offset by an increase in freight rates per total mile 
fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel charge recovery rates and billed loaded miles 
fuel surcharge revenues increased mostly as a result of a increase in average doe diesel fuel prices during the year ended december  compared to the same period of  as well as an improvement in loaded miles versus total miles comparing the two periods 
salaries  wages  and benefits decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the decrease was the net result of a million decrease in driver wages  a million increase in office and shop wages  a million increase in workers compensation and a million decrease in health insurance  and a million increase in other benefits and payroll taxes 
the company driver wage decrease was mainly due a decrease in miles driven year over year as well as a decrease in the overall company average wage rate per mile due mainly to the mix of company drivers based on operating region locations 
office and shop personnel wages increased primarily as a result of more non driver personnel in compared to the same period of health insurance and workers compensation decreased and increased  respectively  due to frequency and severity of claims 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable period of the decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in amounts paid to independent contractors due to fewer miles driven as a result of fewer independent contractors driving for the company 
during the year ended december   independent contractors accounted for of the total fleet miles compared to approximately for the same period in fuel increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the increase is primarily the result of increased fuel prices  million  which was offset by a decrease in volume of million mainly due to fewer miles driven 
fuel cost per mile  net of fuel surcharge  increased in the period compared to the same period of the doe average diesel price per gallon for the year ended december  was per gallon compared to the same period of of per gallon a increase 
the difference in the increase in the doe average price and the company s fuel cost per mile  net of fuel surcharge is largely attributable to newer  more fuel efficient  revenue equipment and improvements in the company s total average fuel economy as well as increases in fuel surcharge revenues 
depreciation decreased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of the decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in average depreciation per tractor due to timing of tractor purchases and the company s tractor depreciation method 
as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase 
the majority of the company s current tractor fleet were purchased throughout therefore each year after the initial purchase  depreciation expense is lower on a per unit basis 
tractors purchased subsequent to january  are being depreciated using the declining balance method and accounted for approximately of the total tractor fleet at december  which was increased to during the th quarter of tractors purchased prior to january  are depreciated using the declining balance method 
the change was the result of the cost of new tractors  current tractor trade values and the expected values in the used equipment market 
the decrease in tractor depreciation due to the aging of equipment was partially offset by higher depreciation on new tractors placed in service during tractor depreciation decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period as a result of the above items 
there was an increase of million in trailer depreciation in the year ended december  compared to the increase in trailer depreciation was the direct result of trailers that had previously been depreciated to salvage value in a prior period being replaced by new trailers 
the change in all other depreciation was not significant 
operating and maintenance expense increased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of operating and maintenance costs increased mainly due to increased tire costs  million  due to a combination of amortization of tires on newly acquired revenue equipment  amortization of replacement tires  and increased tire prices paid in gains on the disposal of property and equipment increased million  to million during the year ended december  from million in the same period of the increase was the combined effect of increases in gains on sales of tractor equipment of million and increased gains on trailer equipment sales of million 
the increase in gains on tractors and trailers was largely due to the company selling approximately more tractors and approximately more trailer equipment during the year ended december  compared to the same period of due to favorable market conditions and the company s continued fleet upgrade program 
the company intends to use strong pricing of used equipment as an opportunity to continue to upgrade its trailer fleet in but to a lessor extent than it did in interest income decreased million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the period 
the decrease is mainly the result of lower average portfolio returns due to the continued historical lows of short term interest rates 
the decrease in the company s overall return was largely attributable to a larger mix of cash and cash equivalents on average held throughout the year compared to the prior year due to calls of long term auction rate security investments tied to longer term interest rates being converted to cash and cash equivalents upon receipt of calls of auction rate securities 
the company s effective tax rate was and for year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to a decrease in favorable income tax expense adjustments during the period compared to the same period of resulting from the roll off of certain state tax contingencies coupled with more taxable income during the current year compared to the same period of as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with during the year ended december  net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  operating revenue increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the increase in revenue was the result of an increase in line haul revenue and other revenues of approximately million and a million increase in fuel surcharge revenue from million in to million in fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel charge recovery rates and billed loaded miles 
fuel surcharge revenues increased mostly as a result of a increase in average doe diesel fuel prices for compared to with additional increases due to increases in miles driven during line haul revenues increased by million based on more miles driven million and increases in average freight rates million 
other revenues increased million as these other fees are directly associated with loads and miles driven 
more miles during compared to resulted from a combination of increased demand for shipping services as shippers were generally shipping more quantities of goods during based on improvements in overall economic conditions 
salaries  wages  and benefits decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the period 
the decrease was the net result of a million increase in driver wages  a million decrease in office and shop wages  a million decrease in workers compensation and a million increase in health insurance and other benefits and payroll taxes 
during  employee drivers accounted for and independent contractors for of the total fleet miles compared to and  respectively  for the company driver wage increase was the net of an increase in miles driven due to freight volume increases in compared to  offset by a decrease in mileage rates paid to new drivers hired subsequent to may to december  office and shop personnel wages decreased primarily as a result of fewer non driver personnel during compared to workers compensation expense decreased million due to an overall decrease in frequency and severity of claims incurred 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the compared period of the decrease is mainly attributable to amounts paid to independent contractors 
the decrease in amounts paid to independent contractors is attributable to fewer miles driven as a result of less independent contractors driving for the company 
during independent contractors accounted for of the company s total miles which was down from in fuel increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period of the increase is the combined result of increased fuel prices million and an increase in miles driven offset by fuel economy improvements and idle reduction initiatives million 
the company s fuel cost per company owned tractor mile increased in compared to the same period of on a increase in cost per gallon compared to fuel cost per mile  net of fuel surcharge  decreased in compared to the same period of despite the increases in fuel prices 
the department of energy doe average diesel price per gallon for was per gallon compared to the same period of of per gallon a increase 
insurance and claims decreased million  to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period of due to a decrease in the frequency and severity of larger auto liability related claims during compared to as well as favorable loss development versus management s estimate 
the company increased the retention limits for auto liability claims from million to million for each claim occurring on or after april  in an effort to offset raises in insurance premium costs 
depreciation increased million  to million during from million in the increase is mainly attributable to an increase in tractor purchases during and and as part of the company s latest fleet upgrade program 
as tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method  depreciation expense declines in years subsequent to the first year after initial purchase 
the majority of the latest tractor fleet upgrade took place throughout therefore  depreciation expense during did not reflect a full first year of depreciation on newly acquired tractors 
tractors purchased subsequent to january  are being depreciated using the declining balance method 
tractors purchased prior to january  are depreciated using the declining balance method 
the change was the result of the cost of new tractors  current tractor trade values and the expected values in the used equipment market 
during the second half of through the company placed in service  new tractors which have a higher base cost than previous tractors purchased approximately and were in their first or second year of depreciation during tractor depreciation increased million to million in from million in the increase in tractor depreciation was offset by a decrease of million in trailer depreciation in compared to the decrease in trailer depreciation was the direct result of an increase in the portion of our trailer fleet being depreciated to the estimated salvage value and accordingly there is not any further depreciation expense on these respective trailers 
the change in all other depreciation was not significant 
operating and maintenance expense increased million  to million during from million in operating and maintenance costs increased due to higher freight volumes when comparing the two periods as well as costs to prepare tractors for trades and certain updates to older trailers within the company s fleet 
the company also experienced increases in over the road repairs mainly due to heightened awareness of maintenance issues under csa compliance guidelines 
gain on the disposal of property and equipment decreased million  to million during from million in the gain decrease was the net effect of a decrease in gains on trades and sales of tractor equipment of million offset by an increase in gains on trailer equipment sales of million and other sales of million 
the decrease in gains on tractors was primarily attributable to a decline in the number of units traded or sold in compared to the increase in gains on trailer sales was due to the company not selling any trailers during interest income decreased million  to million in from million in the decrease is mainly the result of lower average returns due to the decline in interest rates applicable to short and long term investments which persisted throughout the decrease in the company s overall return was largely attributable to a larger mix of cash and cash equivalents tied to short term interest rates from long term auction rate security investments due to a significant amount of calls received during the company s effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to a decrease in a favorable income tax expense adjustments during compared to the same period of resulting from the roll off of certain state tax contingencies 
this is due to the application of the authoritative guidance on uncertain income tax positions coupled with more taxable income during the current year compared to the same period of the company s effective tax rate without adjustments for uncertain income tax positions was consistent from to as a result of the foregoing  the company s operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during the year ended december  compared with during the year ended december  net income increased million  to million for the year ended december  from million during the compared period as a result of the net effects discussed above 
inflation and fuel cost most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  inflation has been fairly modest with its impacts mostly related to revenue equipment prices  tire prices and the compensation paid to the drivers 
innovations in equipment technology  epa mandated new engine emission requirements on tractor engines manufactured after january  and january   and driver comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices 
the company historically has limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
during the fleet upgrade in and  tractors purchased with engines meeting january  epa requirements the company experienced an average increase in tractor prices of mostly attributed to newer engine emission requirements  when compared to tractor prices associated with the previous fleet upgrade tractors with pre january engines 
during  the company purchased additional tractors tractors with engines meeting january  epa requirements and experienced an additional increase in tractor prices 
during  there was significant pricing pressure on freight rates which eased slightly during mid when the company began to experience increases in freight rates in certain markets 
economic conditions continued to improve throughout although the rate increases received in and have significantly lagged the increased prices paid for new revenue equipment over the same period 
in addition to inflation  fluctuations in fuel prices can affect profitability 
most of the company s contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although the company historically has been able to pass through most long term increases in fuel prices and operating taxes to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  shorter term increases are not fully recovered 
during average department of energy doe fuel prices fluctuated between per gallon and per gallon with significant increases in relatively short periods of time 
during and changes in doe average fuel prices were more modest  fluctuating between per gallon and per gallon with increases covering a longer period of time 
during doe average fuel prices were between per gallon and per gallon 
as a result  for the years ended december    and  fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge revenue and fuel stabilization paid to independent contractors along with favorable fuel hedge settlements in  was   and  respectively  of the company s total operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue and gains on sale of equipment 
significant fluctuations in fuel prices increase our cost of operations as the company is unable to pass through all increases in fuel prices 
the company is not able to recover fuel surcharge on empty miles or fuel used in idling so as there are significant changes in fuel prices the company s operating results could be adversely effected 
liquidity and capital resources the growth of the company s business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment 
historically the company has been debt free  funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operations and sales of equipment  which has been the case during the most recent tractor and trailer upgrades 
the company ended with cash and cash equivalents of million 
the company s primary source of liquidity has historically been from operating activities which during was million compared to million during the same period of this was primarily a result of net income excluding non cash depreciation  changes in deferred taxes  and gains on disposal of equipment being approximately million higher during compared to offset by a decrease in cash flow generated by operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the net decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities for compared to the same period of was mainly attributable to increased spending on prepaid tires and an increase in accounts receivable 
cash flow from operating activities was of operating revenues for the year ended december  compared with for the same period of cash flows used in investing activities was million during compared to cash flow provided by investing activities of million during or a decrease of million 
the decrease of investing cash flows was mainly the result of an increase in net capital expenditures cash used in equipment purchases less cash provided from equipment sales of million  as the company continued to upgrade its tractor and trailer fleets with new equipment 
in addition to the increased use of cash for capital expenditures the company experienced a reduction in net cash investment maturities and calls less purchases provided by investments of million 
there was a reduction of million in cash provided by calls of tax free  auction rate student loan educational bonds ars 
the company currently anticipates net capital expenditures on revenue equipment to be approximately million to million for most of which relates to the company s purchase commitment to buy additional trailers in although the company expects to sell trailers during  as anticipated trailer purchases replace older trailers  to provide additional sources of cash flows for new trailers  there are no guaranteed commitments from third parties to buy trailers during and therefore these estimated trailer proceeds have not been used to reduce the company s outstanding commitment 
in september of  the board of directors of the company authorized a program to repurchase million shares  adjusted for stock splits  of the company s common stock in open market or negotiated transactions using available cash  cash equivalents and investments 
the authorization remained open at december  and has no expiration date 
there were million shares repurchased in the open market during the year ended december  for million 
the shares repurchased in were accounted for as treasury stock and are available to be reissued 
no shares were repurchased during the year ended december  approximately million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the program as of december  subsequent to december   the board of directors of the company approved an increase in the amount of shares authorized for repurchase of approximately million shares 
as of february  the total shares authorized for repurchase was million shares 
the specific timing and amount of the repurchases will be determined by market conditions  cash flow requirements  securities law limitations  and other factors 
repurchases will continue from time to time  as conditions permit  until the number of shares authorized to be repurchased have been bought  or until the authorization to repurchase is terminated  whichever occurs first 
the share repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration dates 
the repurchase program may be suspended  modified  or discontinued at any time 
the company paid income taxes  net of refunds  of million in which was million lower than income taxes paid during of million 
the decrease is largely driven by a reduction in estimated federal income tax payments as a result of bonus depreciation for tax purposes on new tractor and trailer equipment purchases during as of the purchase price of new equipment was expensed in for tax purposes  there will not be any tax depreciation deduction available on these assets over the assets estimated tax life and therefore  cash payments for income taxes are expected to be significantly higher in compared to management believes the company has adequate liquidity to meet its current and projected needs in the foreseeable future 
management believes the company will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term which are expected to be funded from cash flows provided by operations  existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  and in certain cases  proceeds from the sale of used equipment 
the company s balance sheet remains debt free 
at december   the company had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  a decrease of million from december  although the company spent million on net equipment purchases and stock repurchases during the year ended december  all of the company s short term and long term investment balances at december  and december  were invested in tax free  auction rate student ars loan educational bonds that are classified as available for sale 
the investments typically have an interest reset provision of days with contractual maturities that currently range from december  to may  at the reset date  the company has the option to roll the investments and reset the interest rate or sell the investments in an auction 
the company receives the par value of the investment plus accrued interest on the reset date if the underlying investment is sold 
as of december   of ars holdings  at par  were backed by the us government and held aaa or equivalent ratings from recognized rating agencies 
as of december   all of the company s auction rate student loan bonds were associated with unsuccessful auctions 
as such  the estimated fair value of the underlying investments had declined below amortized cost of the investments as a result of liquidity issues in the auction rate markets 
to date  there have been no instances of delinquencies or non payment of applicable interest from the issuers and all calls of securities by the issuers have been at par value plus accrued interest 
since the first auction failures in february when the company had approximately million ars at par  the company has received approximately million of calls from issuers  at par  plus accrued interest at the time of the call 
this includes million received during the year ended december  accrued interest income is included in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet and all ars continue to pay interest in accordance with contractual terms 
the company estimates the fair value of the auction rate securities applying the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements which establishes fair value as an estimate of what the company could sell the investments for in an orderly transaction with a third party as of each measurement date 
it is not the intent of the company to sell such securities at discounted pricing 
the authoritative guidance established a three level fair value hierarchy with level investments deriving fair value from quoted prices in active markets and level investments deriving fair value from model based techniques that use significant inputs and assumptions not observable to market participants 
until auction failures began  the fair value of these investments were calculated using level observable inputs and fair value was deemed to be equivalent to amortized cost due to the short term and regularly occurring auction process 
based on auction failures beginning in mid february and continued failures through december   there were no significant observable quoted prices or other relevant inputs for identical or similar securities 
the fair value of these investments as of the december  and measurement dates could not be determined with precision based on lack of observable market data and could significantly change in future measurement periods 
the company performs an internal cash flow analysis on an individual investment basis to estimate fair value of ars using inputs determined based on management s understanding of market conditions as well as information derived from other publicly available third party sources 
this approach considers the anticipated estimated outstanding average life of the underlying student loans range of to years that are the collateral to the trusts  principal outstanding  expected rates of returns over the average life of the underlying student loans using forward rate curves  and payout formulas 
management also uses notices received of intent to call certain securities before their contractual maturities within the cash flow models 
the range of estimated outstanding lives is based on call notices received by the company  communications with trusts  and communications with third party financial institutions 
these underlying cash flows  by individual investment  were discounted using interest rates consistent with instruments of similar quality and duration adjusted for a lack of liquidity in the market 
the company also obtains estimated fair value of ars from third party financial advisors 
the company obtains an understanding of assumptions in models used by third party financial institutions to estimate fair value 
all of this information is considered when determining the estimated fair value of these instruments as recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s discounted cash flow approach requires the use of multiple input factors including an estimated rate of return  base discount rate  and a liquidity discount rate to reflect the current lack of liquidity of ars in capital markets due to auction failures 
we understand that models employed by the company s third party financial advisors are also subject to changes in similar input factors 
as such  the fair value of ars is subject to change based on significant changes to the underlying input factors 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of a basis point change to the rate of return  discount rate  and liquidity discount rate noting that this would not materially impact the recorded fair value 
the table below shows the inputs in the company s cash flow models as of december  for the remaining ars investments compared to the inputs used in cash flow models as of december  inputs used in company models of all securities held as of december  and december   excluding investments whose fair value is estimated to be par value as of the reporting period due to call notices being received by the company were as follows december  december  average life of underlying loans years years rate of return discount rate liquidity discount rate the unrealized loss of million is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss and the company has not recognized any other than temporary impairments in the consolidated statements of income 
there were not any realized gains or losses related to these investments for the years ended december  and the company can not currently project when liquidity will be obtained from these investments and plans to continue to hold such securities until the securities are called  redeemed  or resecuritized by the debt issuers 
off balance sheet transactions the company s liquidity or financial condition is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years purchase obligation obligations for unrecognized tax benefits subsequent to december  the company entered into a commitment to further execute management s plan to upgrade the company s existing trailer fleet 
delivery of trailer equipment under the current program will be throughout estimated gross purchase commitment is approximately million 
obligations for unrecognized tax benefits represent potential liabilities and include interest and penalties 
the company is unable to reasonably determine when these amounts will be settled 
at december  and december   the company had a total of million and million in gross unrecognized tax benefits  respectively 
of this amount  million and million represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate as of december  and  respectively 
unrecognized tax benefits were a net decrease of million and million during the years ended december  and respectively  due mainly to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation net of additions 
this had the effect of reducing the effective state tax rate during these respective periods 
the total net amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in long term income taxes payable per the consolidated balance sheet 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income tax filing positions for the company s corporate subsidiaries 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
these changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations  examinations or other unforeseen circumstances 
as of december   the company is under examinations by two state agencies and has received a notice of intent of an audit from a third state agency 
the company is also currently under an examination with the irs regarding the company s federal tax return for the company does not have any outstanding litigation related to tax matters 
at this time  management s best estimate of the reasonably possible change in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits to be a decrease of approximately million to million during the next twelve months mainly due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations 
as of december   the company is under examinations by two state agencies and has received a notice of intent of an audit from a third state agency 
the company is also currently under an examination with the irs regarding the company s federal tax return for the federal statute of limitations remains open for the years and forward 
tax years and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on the tax code and administrative practice of each state 
as of december  the company did not have any significant operating lease obligations  capital lease obligations or outstanding long term debt obligations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the company s management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
the company has identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of the company s current financial condition and results of operations 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect the financial statements include the following revenue and cost recognition revenue is recognized when freight is delivered and is estimated for loads in transit at the end of an accounting period based on the number of miles run prior to end of the accounting period 
revenue associated with loads delivered but not billed as of the end of an accounting period are estimated as part of revenue for that period 
driver wages and other direct operating expenses are recognized when freight is delivered and are estimated for loads in process at the end of an accounting period 
property  plant and equipment management estimates the useful lives of revenue equipment based on estimated use of the asset 
for tractors  it has been the historical practice of the company to buy tractor and trailer equipment new directly from manufacturers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers are and years  respectively 
management estimates the useful lives on tractors based on average miles per truck per year as well as manufacturer warranty periods 
the company has not historically run tractors outside of manufacturer warranty periods 
management estimates the useful lives of trailers based on manufacturer warranty periods as well as the company s internal maintenance programs 
estimates of salvage value are based upon the expected market values of equipment at the end of the expected useful life 
a key component to expected market values of equipment is the company s historical maintenance programs which in management s opinion is critical to the resale value of equipment 
management selects depreciation methods that it believes most accurately reflects the timing of benefit received from the applicable assets 
tractors are depreciated using the declining balance method for tractors acquired before january  and for tractors acquired after january  as management believes this is the best matching of depreciation expense with the decline in estimated tractor value based on use of the tractor 
the company periodically evaluates property and equipment for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount over which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
there were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended december    self insurance accruals management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
these accruals are based upon individual case estimates  including reserve development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
industry development as well as the company s historical case results are used to determine development of individual case claims 
these liabilities are undiscounted and represent management s best estimate of its ultimate obligations 
share based payments compensation expense and period recognition associated with service based restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and estimated forfeitures over the required service period 
income taxes significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
recent tax law changes have not significantly effected the company s expectation of tax rates 
a valuation allowance is required to be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
the company has recorded a million valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets associated with the unrealized loss due to auction rate securities fair value adjustments 
this valuation allowance was recorded as the company does not have historical capital gains nor does it expect to generate capital gains sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset generated by the fair value adjustments 
the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets as it is management s opinion that it is more likely than not the company will be able to utilize the remaining deferred tax assets based on the company s history of profitability and taxable income 
management judgment is required in the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements based on recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income filing positions and not federal income tax filing positions 
measurement of uncertain income tax positions is based on statutes of limitations  penalty rates  and interest rates on a state by state and year by year basis 
auction rate securities auction rate security investments are valued at fair value applying a fair value hierarchy as established by applicable authoritative accounting guidance 
fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as there is no current active market for these securities  management utilizes a combination of internal discounted cash flow models with key inputs and assumptions being the discount rate  rate of return and duration as well as external market data provided by financial institutions 
management does not consider there to be significant credit risk due to government support of the underlying loans and current credit ratings 
management monitors its investments and ongoing market conditions to assess impairments considered to be other than temporary 
should estimated fair values continue to remain below cost or the fair value decrease significantly from current fair value due to credit related issues  the company may be required to record an impairment of these investments  through a charge in the consolidated statement of income 
to date  the company has not recorded any impairment of these investments in the consolidated statement of income 
the company performs an internal cash flow analysis on an individual investment basis to estimate fair value of ars using inputs determined based on management s own internal considerations as well as information derived from other publicly available third party sources 
this approach considers the anticipated estimated outstanding average life of the underlying student loans range of two years to twelve years that are the collateral to the trusts  principal outstanding  expected rates of returns over the average life of the underlying student loans using forward rate curves  and payout formulas 
the range of estimated outstanding lives is based on call notices received by the company  communications with trusts  and communications with third party financial institutions 
these underlying cash flows  by individual investment  were discounted using interest rates consistent with instruments of similar quality and duration adjusted for a lack of liquidity in the market 
the company also obtains estimated fair value of ars from third party financial advisors 
the company obtains an understanding of assumptions in models used by third party financial institutions to estimate fair value 
all of this information is considered when determining the estimated fair value of these instruments as recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s discounted cash flow approach requires the use of multiple input factors including an estimated rate of return  base discount rate  and a liquidity discount rate to reflect the current lack of liquidity of ars in capital markets due to auction failures 
we understand that models employed by the company s third party financial advisors are also subject to changes in similar input factors 
as such  the estimated fair value of ars is subject to change based on significant changes to the underlying input factors 
the company has analyzed the potential impact of a basis point change to the rate of return  discount rate  and liquidity discount rate noting that this would not materially impact the recorded fair value 
the table below shows the input factors in the company s cash flow models as of december  and december  for the ars investments held on those dates 
december  december  average life of underlying loans years years rate of return discount rate liquidity discount rate the unrealized loss of million is recorded as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss and the company has not recognized any other than temporary impairments in the consolidated statements of income 
there were not any realized gains or losses related to these investments for the years ended december   and new accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and the respective dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general we are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our investments and from changes in commodity prices  primarily fuel and rubber 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes  although we have used in the past for fuel price risk management  and do not use them for either speculation or trading 
because our operations are confined to the united states  we are not subject to a material foreign currency risk 
investments all of the company s short term and long term investment balances at december  and at december  were invested in tax free  auction rate student ars loan educational bonds that are classified as available for sale 
should the company have a need to liquidate any of these investments  the company may be required to discount these securities for liquidity but the company currently does not have this liquidity requirement 
based on historical and current operating cash flows  the company does not currently anticipate a requirement to liquidate underlying investments at discounted prices 
if the investments are downgraded in the credit ratings or the company witnesses other indicators of issues with collection  the company may be required to recognize an other than temporary impairment on these securities and record a charge in the statement of income 
assuming the company maintains short term and long term investment balances consistent with balances as of december   million amortized cost  and if market rates of interest on our investments decreased by basis points  the estimated reduction in annual interest income would be approximately million 
interest rate risk the company has no debt outstanding as of december  and therefore  has no market risk related to debt 
management believes that an increase in short term interest rates could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition only if we incur substantial indebtedness and the interest rate increases are not offset by freight rate increases or other items 
management does not foresee or expect in the near future any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how that exposure is managed by us 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk primarily with respect to purchases of fuel and rubber 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of our short term fuel price increases from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
we believe that the majority of the fuel price increases are generally passed to our customers although based on the company s historical experience  the company is not able to pass through to customers of fuel price increases 
the company is not able to pass through fuel costs associated with out of route miles and tractor idle time 
we use a significant amount of tires to maintain our revenue equipment 
the company is not able to pass through of price increases from tire suppliers due to the severity and timing of increases and current rate environment 
historically  we have sought to minimize tire price increases through bulk tire purchases from our suppliers
