overview irobot designs and builds robots that make a difference 
for over years  we have developed proprietary technology incorporating advanced concepts in navigation  mobility  manipulation and artificial intelligence to build industry leading robots 
our roomba floor vacuuming robot and scooba floor washing robot perform time consuming domestic chores in the home  while our looj gutter cleaning robot and verro pool cleaning robot perform tasks outside the home 
our packbot and small unmanned ground vehicle sugv tactical ground military robots perform battlefield reconnaissance and bomb disposal 
our ka seaglider unmanned underwater robot performs long endurance oceanic missions 
we sell our robots to consumers through a variety of distribution channels  including chain stores and other national retailers  and through our on line store  and to the us military and other government agencies worldwide 
we maintain certifications for as and capability maturity model integration 
these certifications enable us to service our military products and services 

table of contents as of december   we had full time employees 
we have developed expertise in the disciplines necessary to build durable  high performance and cost effective robots through the close integration of software  electronics and hardware 
our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to develop next generation and new products  reducing the time  cost and risk of product development 
our significant expertise in robot design and engineering  combined with our management team s experience in military and consumer markets  positions us to capitalize on the expected growth in the market for robots 
although we have successfully launched consumer and government and industrial products  our continued success depends upon our ability to respond to a number of future challenges 
we believe the most significant of these challenges include increasing competition in the markets for both our consumer and government and industrial products  our ability to obtain us federal government funding for research and development programs  and our ability to successfully develop and introduce products and product enhancements 
revenue we currently derive revenue from product sales  government research and development contracts  and commercial research and development contracts 
product revenue is derived from the sale of our various home cleaning robots and government and industrial robots and related accessories 
research and development revenue is derived from the execution of contracts awarded by the us federal government  other governments and a small number of other partners 
in the future  we expect to derive increasing revenue from product maintenance and support services due to a focused effort to market these services to the expanding installed base of our robots 
we currently derive a majority of our product revenue from the sale of our home cleaning robots  and our packbot and sugv tactical military robots 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   product revenues accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   our funded research and development contracts accounted for approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to perform funded research and development work with the intent of leveraging the technology developed to advance our new product development efforts 
in the future  based on changes in operational needs from us armed forces  and significant pressures on us spending levels  we anticipate that revenue from product sales to the us armed forces could remain flat or decrease in the near term 
in addition  we expect that revenue from funded research and development contracts could decrease on an absolute dollar basis 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   approximately and  respectively  of our home robot product revenue resulted from sales to customers 
for fiscal and fiscal  the customers were comprised of both us retailers and international distributors 
direct to consumer revenue generated through our domestic and international on line stores accounted for of our home robot product revenue for the fiscal year ended december  compared to in the fiscal year ended january  we typically sell our recently launched products direct on line  and then subsequently offer these products through other channels of distribution 
in addition  and of military product revenue  and and of funded research and development contract revenue  resulted from orders and contracts or subcontracts with the us federal government in the fiscal years ended december  and january   respectively 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   sales to non us customers accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
our revenue from product sales is generated through sales to our retail distribution channels  our distributor network and to certain us and foreign governments 
we recognize revenue from the sales of home robots under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer  net of estimated returns  provided that collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no significant obligations remain 
revenue from our military robot sales and revenue from funded research and development contracts are occasionally influenced by the september fiscal year end of the us federal government 
in addition  our revenue can be affected by the timing of the release of new products and the size and timing of contract awards from military and other government agencies 
historically  revenue from consumer product sales has been significantly seasonal  with a majority of our consumer product revenue generated in the second half of the year 
table of contents in advance of the holiday season 
as a result of the growth of our international consumer business  which is less seasonal than our domestic consumer business  our consumer product revenue is currently spread more evenly throughout the year 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of raw materials and labor that go into the development and manufacture of our products as well as manufacturing overhead costs such as manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  logistics and warranty costs 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   cost of product revenue was and of total product revenue  respectively 
the decrease in cost of product revenue as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by changes in product mix to higher margin home robot products  improved leverage of our overhead expense against higher revenue  and lower return provisions and warranty expense 
raw material costs  which are our most significant cost items  can fluctuate materially on a periodic basis  although many components have been historically stable 
additionally  unit costs can vary significantly depending on the mix of products sold 
there can be no assurance that our costs of raw materials will not increase 
labor costs also comprise a significant portion of our cost of revenue 
we outsource the manufacture of our home robots to contract manufacturers in china 
while labor costs in china traditionally have been favorable compared to labor costs elsewhere in the world  including the united states  we believe that labor in china is becoming more scarce 
in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates could increase the cost of labor 
consequently  the labor costs for our home robots could increase in the future 
cost of contract revenue includes the direct labor costs of engineering resources committed to funded research and development contracts  as well as third party consulting  travel and associated direct material costs 
additionally  we include overhead expenses such as indirect engineering labor  occupancy costs associated with the project resources  engineering tools and supplies and program management expenses 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   cost of contract revenue was and of total contract revenue  respectively 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of revenue varies according to the mix of product and contract revenue  the mix of products sold  total sales volume  the level of defective product returns  and levels of other product costs such as warranty  scrap  re work and manufacturing overhead 
for the years ended december  and january   gross margin was and of total revenue  respectively 
the increase in margin was driven primarily by changes in product mix to higher margin home robot products  improved leverage of our overhead expense against higher revenue  and lower return provisions and warranty expense 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our engineers  costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development  and costs of test equipment used during product development 
we have significantly expanded our research and development capabilities and expect to continue to expand these capabilities in the future 
we are committed to consistently maintaining the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive to enhance our ability to serve our existing consumer and military markets as well as new markets for robots 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   research and development expense was million and million  or and of total revenue  respectively 
in addition to our internal research and development activities discussed above  we incur research and development expenses under funded development arrangements with both governments and other third parties 

table of contents for the fiscal years ended december  and january   these expenses amounted to million and million  respectively 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses have been classified as cost of revenue rather than research and development expense 
for the years ended december  and january   the combined investment in future technologies  classified as cost of revenue and research and development expense  was million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel  advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  fulfillment costs associated with direct to consumer sales through our on line store  customer service costs  professional services costs  information systems and infrastructure costs  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively flat as a percentage of revenue in the foreseeable future as we continue to build the irobot brand and also maintain company profitability 
for the fiscal years ended december  and january   selling  general and administrative expense was million and million  or and of total revenue  respectively 
fiscal periods we operate and report using a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  our fiscal quarters will end on the saturday that falls closest to the last day of the third month of each quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of consumer products under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer  which is typically upon the delivery of the product  provided the price is fixed or determinable  collection is determined to be reasonably assured and no significant obligations remain 
sales to domestic resellers are typically subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return for defective products only  rebates and price protection 
accordingly  we reduce revenue for our estimates of 
table of contents liabilities for these rights of return at the time the related sale is recorded 
we establish a provision for sales returns for products sold by domestic resellers directly based on historical return experience and other relevant data 
our international distributor agreements do not currently allow for product returns and  as a result  no reserve for returns is established for this group of customers 
we have aggregated and analyzed historical returns from domestic resellers and end users which form the basis of our estimate of future sales returns by resellers or end users 
when a right of return exists  the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
if actual returns from retailers differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
our returns reserve is calculated as a percentage of gross consumer product revenue 
a small increase or decrease in our actual experience of returns could have a material impact on our quarterly and annual results of operations 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns 
the estimates and reserve for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
if future trends or our ability to estimate were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions or increases to revenue may result based on this new experience 
under cost plus research and development contracts  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred plus a pro rata portion of the total fixed fee 
costs and estimated gross margins on contracts are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs and funding 
we recognize revenue on firm fixed price ffp contracts using the percentage of completion method 
for government product ffp contracts revenue is recognized as the product is shipped or in accordance with the contract terms 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements and government audit  may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recorded or recognized  as the case may be  in the period in which the revisions are determined 
since many contracts extend over a long period of time  revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting earnings applicable to past performance in the current period 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
revenue earned in excess of billings  if any  is recorded as unbilled revenue 
billings in excess of revenue earned  if any  are recorded as deferred revenue 
accounting for stock based awards we recognized million of stock based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended december  for stock options 
the unamortized fair value as of december  associated with these grants was million with a weighted average remaining recognition period of years 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury constant maturity rate  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant  commensurate with the expected life of the instrument 
the dividend yield is zero based upon the fact that we have never paid and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
prior to  the expected term calculation was based upon the simplified method provided under the relevant authoritative guidance 
during  we began to rely solely on company specific historical data to calculate the expected term 
given our initial public offering in november and the resulting short history as a public company  we could not rely solely on company specific historical data for purposes of establishing expected volatility 
consequently  prior to  we performed an analysis that included company specific historical data combined with data of several peer companies with similar expected option lives to develop expected volatility assumptions 
during  we began to rely solely on company specific historical data for purposes of establishing expected volatility 
based upon the above assumptions  the weighted average fair value of each stock option granted for the fiscal year ended december  was 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company recognized million of stock based compensation associated with restricted stock units 
unamortized expense associated with restricted stock units at december   was million 

table of contents we have assumed a forfeiture rate for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock based units granted subsequent to the company s initial filing of its form s with the sec 
in the future  we will record incremental stock based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rates are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior stock based compensation expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
accounting for stock based awards requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives to value equity based compensation 
accounting for income taxes deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we monitor the realization of our deferred tax assets based on changes in circumstances  for example  recurring periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations 
our income tax provision and our assessment of the ability to realize our deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and estimates 
in fiscal  we completed an analysis of historical and projected future profitability which resulted in the full release of the valuation allowance relating to federal deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  based on recent and expected increased future profitability the valuation allowance relating to state deferred tax assets was released 
at december   we have total deferred tax assets of million with no valuation allowance 
warranty we typically provide a one year warranty with the exception of european consumer products which typically have a two year warranty period and our government and industrial spares which typically have a warranty period of less than one year against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods  provide replacement products at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products 
we record estimated warranty costs  based on historical experience by product  at the time we recognize product revenue 
as the complexity of our products increases  we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced  and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory or its current estimated market value 
we write down inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those that we project and this difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin if inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  if actual demand and market conditions are more favorable than those we estimated at the time of such a write down  our gross margin could be favorably impacted in future periods

included in the provision is a million provision associated with an out of period error correction with respect to the earnings of our india subsidiary and a million one time benefit from the conversion of incentive stock options to non qualified stock options as a result of our stock option exchange program which concluded in our second fiscal quarter of liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million  short term investments of million and accounts receivable of million 
we manufacture and distribute our products through contract manufacturers and third party logistics providers 
we believe that this approach gives us the advantages of relatively low capital investment and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels 
by leasing our office facilities  we also minimize the cash needed for expansion 
accordingly  our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements  computers  office furniture  product specific production tooling  internal use software and test equipment 
in the fiscal years ended december  and january   we spent million and million  respectively  on capital equipment 
our strategy for delivering home robots products to our distributors and retail customers gives us the flexibility to provide container shipments directly to the retailer from china and  alternatively  allows our 
table of contents distributors and retail partners to take possession of product on a domestic basis 
accordingly  our home robots product inventory consists of goods shipped to our third party logistics providers for the fulfillment of distributor  retail and direct to consumer sales 
our inventory of government and industrial products is relatively low as they are generally built to order 
our contract manufacturers are responsible for purchasing and stocking the majority of components required for the production of our products  and they typically invoice us when the finished goods are shipped

working capital and capital expenditure needs we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and operating leases  all of which we anticipate funding through working capital  funds provided by operating activities and our existing working capital line of credit 
we do not currently anticipate significant investment in property  plant and equipment  and we believe that our outsourced approach to manufacturing provides us with flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available through our working capital line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next twelve months 
in the event that our revenue plan does not meet our expectations  we may eliminate or curtail expenditures to mitigate the impact on our working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies  and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
moreover  to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash from operations  and cash from short term borrowing are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
as part of our business strategy  we may consider additional acquisitions of companies  technologies and products  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

our principal commitments consist of obligations under our working capital line of credit  leases for office space and minimum contractual obligations for services

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures 
the new guidance clarifies the concepts applicable for fair value measurement of non financial assets and requires the disclosure of quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement 
this guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and will be applied prospectively 
we do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance 
in june  the fasb amended its accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income oci in an entity s financial statements 
the amended guidance eliminates the option to present the components of oci as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and provides two options for presenting oci in a statement included in the income statement or in a separate statement immediately following the income statement 
the amendments do not change the guidance for the items that have to be reported in oci or when an item of oci has to be moved into net income 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not anticipate that our adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated results 
in september  the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
the updated guidance gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the updated accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we elected to adopt the updated guidance in the adoption of this guidance did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with operating expenses of our foreign operations  but we believe this exposure to be immaterial 
additionally  we accept orders for home robots products in currencies other than the us dollar 
we regularly monitor the level of non us dollar accounts receivable balances to determine if any actions  including possibly entering into foreign currency forward contracts  should be taken to minimize the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on our results of operations 
our international revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore any fluctuations in the euro or any other non us dollar currencies will have minimal direct impact on our international revenue 
however  as the us dollar strengthens or weakens against other currencies  our international distributors may be impacted  which could affect their profitability and our ability to maintain current pricing levels on our international consumer products 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities  commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
as of december   all of our cash and cash equivalents were held in demand deposits and money market accounts 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on any outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under our working capital line of credit 
the advances under the working capital line of credit bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the libor rate at the time of the borrowing 
at december   we had letters of credit outstanding of million under our revolving letter of credit facility
