overview we are engaged principally in the business of renting and leasing of cars and equipment 
our revenues primarily are derived from rental and related charges and consist of car rental revenues revenues from all company operated car rental and fleet leasing operations and management services  including charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees  the fueling of vehicles and the sale of loss or collision damage waivers  liability insurance coverage and other products  equipment rental revenues revenues from all company operated equipment rental operations  including amounts charged to customers for the fueling and delivery of equipment and sale of loss damage waivers  as well as revenues from the sale of new equipment and consumables  and other revenues primarily relates to fees and certain cost reimbursements from our licensees and revenues from our third party claim management services 
our expenses primarily consist of direct operating expenses primarily wages and related benefits  commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities  travel agents and others  facility  self insurance and reservation costs  the cost of new equipment and consumables purchased for resale  and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning equipment  such as damage  maintenance and fuel costs  depreciation expense and lease charges relating to revenue earning equipment including net gains or losses on the disposal of such equipment 
revenue earning equipment includes cars and rental equipment  selling  general and administrative expenses including advertising  and interest expense 
our profitability is primarily a function of the volume  mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of cars and equipment 
significant changes in the purchase price or residual values of cars and equipment or interest rates can have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes 
we continue to balance our mix of non program and program vehicles based on market conditions 
our business requires significant expenditures for cars and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued equipment  and consequently we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
car rental in the us  as of december   the percentage of non program cars was as compared to as of december  internationally  as of december   the percentage of non program cars was  compared to as of december  in recent periods we have decreased the percentage of program cars in our car rental fleet 
non program cars typically have lower acquisition costs and lower depreciation rates than comparable program cars 
as a result of decreasing our reliance on program cars  we reduce our risk related to the creditworthiness of the vehicle manufacturers 
with fewer program cars in our fleet  we have an increased risk that the market value of a car at the time of its disposition will be less than its estimated residual value 
program cars generally provide us with flexibility to reduce the size of our fleet by returning cars sooner than originally expected without risk of loss in the event of an economic downturn or to respond to changes in rental demand 
this flexibility will be reduced as the percentage of non program cars in our car rental fleet increases 
furthermore  it is expected that the average age of our fleet will increase since the average holding period for non program vehicles is longer than program vehicles 
however  the longer holding period does not necessarily equate to higher costs due to the stringent turnback requirements imposed by vehicle manufacturers for program cars 
in the year ended december   our monthly per vehicle depreciation costs decreased as compared to the prior year period due to improved residual values in the us  a continued move towards a greater proportion of non program vehicles  mix optimization and improved procurement and remarketing efforts 
we believe the increase in residual values in the us was partially due to the events in japan earlier this year which leveled off as these events worked their way through the vehicle supply chain 
for the year ended december   we experienced an increase in transaction days versus the prior period in the united states while rental rate revenue per transaction day  or rpd  declined by 
during the year ended december   in our european operations  we experienced a improvement in transaction days while rpd declined by compared to the year ended december  since january   we increased the number of our off airport rental locations in the united states by to  locations 
revenues from our us off airport operations represented  million   million and million of our total car rental revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our strategy includes selected openings of new off airport locations  the disciplined evaluation of existing locations and the pursuit of same store sales growth 
our strategy also includes increasing penetration in the off airport market and growing the online leisure market  particularly in the longer length weekly sector  which is characterized by lower vehicle costs and lower transaction costs at a lower rpd 
increasing our penetration in these sectors is consistent with our long term strategy to generate profitable growth 
when we open a new off airport location  we incur a number of costs  including those relating to site selection  lease negotiation  recruitment of employees  selection and development of managers  initial sales activities and integration of our systems with those of the companies who will reimburse the location s replacement renters for their rentals 
a new off airport location  once opened  takes time to generate its full potential revenues and  as a result  revenues at new locations do not initially cover their start up costs and often do not  for some time  cover the costs of their ongoing operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued on september   hertz acquired of the equity interest in donlen  a leading provider of fleet leasing and management services for corporate fleets and for the four months ended december  period it was owned by hertz  had an average of approximately  vehicles under lease and management 
donlen provides hertz an immediate leadership position in long term car  truck and equipment leasing and fleet management 
donlen s fleet management programs provide outsource solutions to reduce fleet operating costs and improve driver productivity 
these programs include administration of preventive maintenance  advisory services  and fuel and accident management along with other complementary services 
this transaction is part of the overall growth strategy of hertz to provide the most flexible transportation programs for corporate and general consumers 
additionally  donlen brings to hertz a specialized consulting and technology expertise that will enable us to model  measure and manage fleet performance more effectively and efficiently 
while hertz holdings withdrew its exchange offer for dollar thrifty s common stock in october  we continue to believe that a merger with dollar thrifty is in the best interests of both companies 
hertz holdings remains engaged with the federal trade commission to secure antitrust clearance with respect to an acquisition of dollar thrifty  which would require among other things the disposition of advantage 
if and when we are in a position to obtain antitrust clearance  we will reassess the appropriate price and other terms and conditions of an offer for dollar thrifty 
we can offer no assurance that any transaction with dollar thrifty will be commenced or consummated 
equipment rental herc experienced higher rental volumes and pricing worldwide for year ended december  compared to the prior year period as the industry continued its recovery and fleet levels began to align with demand in the industry 
specifically  we continued to see growth in our specialty services such as pump power  industrial plant services and hertz entertainment services capitalizing on the opportunities in these strategic market niches 
additionally  there were increased opportunities in as rental solutions became a more viable alternative to contractors especially with the fluctuating uncertainty in the economy enabling herc and other large rental companies to gain market share 
seasonality our car rental and equipment rental operations are seasonal businesses  with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during the spring and summer 
we have the ability to dynamically manage fleet capacity  the most significant portion of our cost structure  to meet market demand 
for instance  to accommodate increased demand  we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year 
as business demand declines  fleet and staff are decreased accordingly 
a number of our other major operating costs  including airport concession fees  commissions and vehicle liability expenses  are directly related to revenues or transaction volumes 
in addition  our management expects to utilize enhanced process improvements  including efficiency initiatives and the use of our information technology systems  to help manage our variable costs 
approximately two thirds of our typical annual operating costs represent variable costs  while the remaining one third is fixed or semi fixed 
we also maintain a flexible workforce  with a significant number of part time and seasonal workers 
however  certain operating expenses  including rent  insurance  and administrative overhead  remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand 
revenues related to our fleet management services are generally not seasonal 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring as part of our ongoing effort to implement our strategy of reducing operating costs  we have evaluated our workforce and operations and made adjustments  including headcount reductions and business process reengineering resulting in optimized work flow at rental locations and maintenance facilities as well as streamlined our back office operations and evaluated potential outsourcing opportunities 
when we made adjustments to our workforce and operations  we incurred incremental expenses that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce and operating structure  but we believe that increased operating efficiency and reduced costs associated with the operation of our business are important to our long term competitiveness 
during through  we announced several initiatives to improve our competitiveness and industry leadership through targeted job reductions 
these initiatives included  but were not limited to  job reductions at our corporate headquarters and back office operations in the us and europe 
as part of our re engineering optimization we outsourced selected functions globally 
in addition  we streamlined operations and reduced costs by initiating the closure of targeted car rental locations and equipment rental branches throughout the world 
the largest of these closures occurred in which resulted in closures of approximately off airport locations and branches in our us equipment rental business 
these initiatives impacted approximately  employees 
for the years ended december   and  our consolidated statement of operations includes restructuring charges relating to various initiatives of million  million and million  respectively 
additional efficiency and cost saving initiatives are being developed  however  we presently do not have firm plans or estimates of any related expenses 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact our future results of operations and financial condition 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
revenue earning equipment our principal assets are revenue earning equipment  which represented approximately of our total assets as of december  revenue earning equipment consists of vehicles utilized in our car rental operations and equipment utilized in our equipment rental operations 
for the year ended december   of the vehicles purchased for our combined us and international car rental fleets were subject to repurchase by automobile manufacturers under contractual repurchase and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued guaranteed depreciation programs  subject to certain manufacturers car condition and mileage requirements  at a specific price during a specified time period 
these programs limit our residual risk with respect to vehicles purchased under these programs 
for all other vehicles  as well as equipment acquired by our equipment rental business  we use historical experience and monitor market conditions to set depreciation rates 
generally  when revenue earning equipment is acquired  we estimate the period that we will hold the asset  primarily based on historical measures of the amount of rental activity eg  automobile mileage and equipment usage and the targeted age of equipment at the time of disposal 
we also estimate the residual value of the applicable revenue earning equipment at the expected time of disposal 
the residual values for rental vehicles are affected by many factors  including make  model and options  age  physical condition  mileage  sale location  time of the year and channel of disposition eg  auction  retail  dealer direct 
the residual value for rental equipment is affected by factors which include equipment age and amount of usage 
depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated holding period 
depreciation rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis based on management s ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions  their effect on residual values at the time of disposal and the estimated holding periods 
market conditions for used vehicle and equipment sales can also be affected by external factors such as the economy  natural disasters  fuel prices and incentives offered by manufacturers of new cars 
these key factors are considered when estimating future residual values and assessing depreciation rates 
as a result of this ongoing assessment  we make periodic adjustments to depreciation rates of revenue earning equipment in response to changing market conditions 
upon disposal of revenue earning equipment  depreciation expense is adjusted for the difference between the net proceeds received and the remaining net book value 
within our donlen subsidiary  revenue earning equipment is under longer term lease agreements with our customers 
these leases contain provisions whereby we have a contracted residual value guaranteed to us by the lessee  such that we do not experience any gains or losses on the disposal of these vehicles 
therefore depreciation rates on these vehicles are not adjusted at any point in time per the associated lease contract 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
public liability and property damage the obligation for public liability and property damage on self insured us and international vehicles and equipment represents an estimate for both reported accident claims not yet paid  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the related liabilities are recorded on a non discounted basis 
reserve requirements are based on actuarial evaluations of historical accident claim experience and trends  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
the adequacy of the liability is regularly monitored based on evolving accident claim history and insurance related state legislation changes 
if our estimates change or if actual results differ from these assumptions  the amount of the recorded liability is adjusted to reflect these results 
our actual results as compared to our estimates have historically resulted in relatively minor adjustments to our recorded liability 
pensions our employee pension costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term return 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension costs and obligations 
the various employee related actuarial assumptions eg  retirement rates  mortality rates  salary growth used in determining pension costs and plan liabilities are reviewed periodically by management  assisted by the enrolled actuary  and updated as warranted 
the discount rate used to value the pension liabilities and related expenses and the expected rate of return on plan assets are the two most significant assumptions impacting pension expense 
the discount rate used is a market based spot rate as of the valuation date 
for the expected return on assets assumption  we use a forward looking rate that is based on the expected return for each asset class including the value added by active investment management  weighted by the target asset allocation 
the past annualized long term performance of the plans assets has generally been in line with the long term rate of return assumption 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our pension plans  see item a risk factors in this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable  and also review goodwill annually 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
goodwill must be tested at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 
however  components are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital  or wacc  methodology 
the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
the cash flows represent management s most recent planning assumptions 
these assumptions are based on a combination of industry outlooks  views on general economic conditions  our expected pricing plans and expected future savings generated by our past restructuring activities 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long term growth rates 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
a significant decline in the projected cash flows or a change in the wacc used to determine fair value could result in a future goodwill impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter  we performed our annual impairment analysis based upon market data as of october  and concluded that there was no impairment related to our goodwill and our other indefinite lived intangible assets 
at october   we had five reporting units  which were the same as our operating segments us car rental  europe car rental  other international car rental  donlen and worldwide equipment rental 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we performed the impairment analyses for our reporting units  using our business and long term strategic plans  revised to reflect the current economic conditions 
our weighted average cost of capital used in the discounted cash flow model was calculated based upon the fair value of our debt and our stock price with a debt to equity ratio comparable to our industry 
the total fair value of our reporting units was then compared to our market capitalization to ensure their reasonableness 
we re evaluate the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets annually or as circumstances change 
those intangible assets considered to have indefinite useful lives  including our trade name  are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying value 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
in addition  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangible assets might not be recoverable  we will perform an impairment review 
the valuation of our indefinite lived assets utilized the relief from royalty method  which incorporates cash flows and discount rates comparable to those discussed above 
we also considered the excess earnings as a percentage of revenues to ensure their reasonableness 
our analysis supported our conclusion that an impairment did not exist 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
derivatives we periodically enter into cash flow and other hedging transactions to specifically hedge exposure to various risks related to interest rates  fuel prices and foreign currency rates 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and have not been used for speculative or trading purposes 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion is recognized currently in earnings within the same line item as the hedged item  based upon the nature of the hedged item 
for derivative instruments that are not part of a qualified hedging relationship  the changes in their fair value are recognized currently in earnings 
the valuation methods used to mark these to market are either market quotes for fuel swaps and foreign exchange instruments or a discounted cash flow method for interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
the key inputs for the discounted cash flow method are the current yield curve and the credit default swap spread 
these valuations are subject to change based on movements in items such as the london inter bank offered rate  or libor  our credit worthiness and unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel prices 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
subsequent changes to enacted tax rates and changes to the global mix of earnings will result in changes to the tax rates used to calculate deferred taxes and any related valuation allowances 
provisions are not made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outside the united states or are expected to be remitted free of taxes 
future distributions  if any  from these international subsidiaries to the united states or changes in us tax rules may require recording a tax on these amounts 
we have recorded a deferred tax asset for unutilized net operating loss carryforwards in various tax jurisdictions 
upon utilization  the taxing authorities may examine the positions that led to the generations of those net operating losses 
if the utilization of any of those losses are disallowed a deferred tax liability may have to be recorded 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
stock based compensation the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments is based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we estimated the fair value of options issued at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  which includes assumptions related to volatility  expected term  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
these factors combined with the stock price on the date of grant result in a fixed expense which is recorded on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the key factors used in the valuation process  other than the forfeiture rate  remained unchanged from the date of grant 
because the stock of hertz holdings became publicly traded in november and has a short trading history  it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price  or a peer company share price  because there is not sufficient historical information about past volatility 
therefore  we use the calculated value method to estimate the expected volatility  based on the dow jones specialized consumer services sub sector within the consumer services industry  and we use the us large capitalization component  which includes the top of the index universe by market value 
we use the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
we believe it is appropriate to continue to use this simplified method because we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term due to the limited period of time our common stock has been publicly traded 
the assumed dividend yield is zero 
the risk free interest rate is the implied zero coupon yield for us treasury securities having a maturity approximately equal to the expected term of the options  as of the grant dates 
the non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the hertz global holdings  inc stock incentive plan  or the stock incentive plan  the hertz global holdings  inc director stock incentive plan  or the director plan  and the hertz global holdings  inc omnibus incentive plan  or the omnibus plan  are pushed down from hertz holdings and recorded on the books at the hertz level

b car rental rate revenue consists of all revenue  net of discounts  associated with the rental of cars including charges for optional insurance products  but excluding revenue derived from fueling and concession and other expense pass throughs  neverlost units in the us and certain ancillary revenue 
rental rate revenue per transaction day is calculated as total rental rate revenue  divided by the total number of transaction days  with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
this statistic is important to our management as it represents the best measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the car rental business and encompasses the elements in car rental pricing that management has the ability to control 
the optional insurance products are packaged within certain negotiated corporate  government and membership programs and within certain retail rates being charged 
based upon these existing programs and rate packages  management believes that these optional insurance products should be consistently included in the daily pricing of car rental transactions 
on the other hand  non rental rate revenue items such as refueling and concession pass through expense items are driven by factors beyond the control of management ie the price of fuel and the concession fees charged by airports 
additionally  neverlost units are an optional revenue product which management does not consider to be part of their daily pricing of car rental transactions

as of december   we had  million of total indebtedness outstanding 
cash paid for interest during the year ended december   was million  net of amounts capitalized 
accordingly  we are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service on our indebtedness and from the funding of our costs of operations and capital expenditures

for a description of these amounts  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under caption item financial statements and supplementary data

a significant number of cars that we purchase are subject to repurchase by car manufacturers under contractual repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs 
under these programs  car manufacturers agree to repurchase cars at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the cars during a specified time period  typically subject to certain car condition and mileage requirements 
we use book values derived from this specified price or guaranteed depreciation rate to calculate financing capacity under certain asset backed and asset based financing arrangements 
in the event of a bankruptcy of a car manufacturer  our liquidity would be impacted by several factors including reductions in fleet residual values and the risk that we would be unable to collect outstanding receivables due to us from such bankrupt manufacturer 
in addition  the program cars manufactured by any such company would need to be removed from our financing facilities or re designated as non program vehicles  which would require us to furnish additional credit enhancement associated with these program vehicles 
for a discussion of the risks associated with a manufacturer s bankruptcy or our reliance on asset backed and asset based financing  see item a risk factors included in this annual report 
we rely significantly on asset backed and asset based financing arrangements to purchase cars for our domestic and international car rental fleet 
the amount of financing available to us pursuant to these programs depends on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  including recently adopted legislation  proposed sec rules and regulations and other legislative and administrative developments 
in this regard  there has been uncertainty regarding the potential impact of recently

we contributed million to our us pension plan during and expect to contribute between million and million to our us pension plan during the level of and future contributions will vary  and is dependent on a number of factors including investment returns  interest rate fluctuations  plan demographics  funding regulations and the results of the final actuarial valuation 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
off balance sheet commitments and arrangements as of december  and december   the following guarantees including indemnification commitments were issued and outstanding indemnification obligations in the ordinary course of business  we execute contracts involving indemnification obligations customary in the relevant industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction such as the sale of a business 
these indemnification obligations might include claims relating to the following environmental matters  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and employment related matters  customer  supplier and other commercial contractual relationships  and financial matters 
performance under these indemnification obligations would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
we regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnification obligations and have accrued for expected losses that are probable and estimable 
the types of indemnification obligations for which payments are possible include the following sponsors  directors hertz has entered into customary indemnification agreements with hertz holdings  the sponsors and our stockholders affiliated with the sponsors  pursuant to which hertz holdings and hertz will indemnify the sponsors  our stockholders affiliated with the sponsors and their respective affiliates  directors  officers  partners  members  employees  agents  representatives and controlling persons  against certain liabilities arising out of performance of a consulting agreement with hertz holdings and each of the sponsors and certain other claims and liabilities  including liabilities arising out of financing arrangements or securities offerings 
we also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors 
we do not believe that these indemnifications are reasonably likely to have a material impact on us 
environmental we have indemnified various parties for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage  recycling or disposal sites in many states and  in some instances  for natural 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued resource damages 
the amount of any such expenses or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial 
the probable expenses that we expect to incur for such matters have been accrued  and those expenses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  the aggregate amounts accrued for environmental liabilities  including liability for environmental indemnities  reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other accrued liabilities were million and million  respectively 
the accrual generally represents the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean up activities  and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions  including on going maintenance  as required 
cost estimates are developed by site 
initial cost estimates are based on historical experience at similar sites and are refined over time on the basis of in depth studies of the sites 
for many sites  the remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be reasonably estimated because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site  the materials there  the involvement of other potentially responsible parties  the application of laws and other standards or regulations  site conditions  and the nature and scope of investigations  studies  and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent  duration  and success of remediation 
risk management for a discussion of additional risks arising from our operations  including vehicle liability  general liability and property damage insurable risks  see item business risk management in this annual report 
market risks we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates including credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in gasoline prices 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and have not been used for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on such instruments 
for more information on these exposures  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
interest rate risk from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements and or interest rate cap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
see notes and to the notes to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
we have a significant amount of debt with variable rates of interest based generally on libor  euro inter bank offered rate  or euribor  or their equivalents for local currencies or bank conduit commercial paper rates plus an applicable margin 
increases in interest rates could therefore significantly increase the associated interest payments that we are required to make on this debt 
see note to the notes to our audited annual consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings assuming various changes in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percentage point in interest rates on our debt portfolio as of december   our net income would decrease by an estimated million over a twelve month period 
consistent with the terms of the agreements governing the respective debt obligations  we may hedge a portion of the floating rate interest exposure under the various debt facilities to provide protection in respect of such exposure 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and primarily with respect to the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and british pound 
we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring  to the extent practicable  operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate  including making fleet and equipment purchases and borrowing locally 
also  we have purchased foreign exchange options to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for selected marketing programs 
the effect of exchange rate changes on these financial instruments would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our risks with respect to foreign exchange options are limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option and the future performance of the option s counterparty 
we also manage exposure to fluctuations in currency risk on intercompany loans we make to certain of our subsidiaries by entering into foreign currency forward contracts at the time of the loans which are intended to offset the impact of foreign currency movements on the underlying intercompany loan obligations 
on october   we designated our senior notes due as an effective net investment hedge of our euro denominated net investment in our international operations 
effective november   we de designated the net investment hedge 
for the year ended december   our consolidated statement of operations contained realized and unrealized losses relating to the effects of foreign currency of million 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
other risks we purchase unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel at prevailing market rates 
in january  we began a program to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
for the year ended december   we recognized a gain of million in direct operating on our consolidated statement of operations relating to our gasoline swaps 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
inflation the increased cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting us 
many of our other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation  including health care costs and gasoline 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued management does not expect that the effect of inflation on our overall operating costs will be greater for us than for our competitors 
income taxes in january  we implemented a lke program for our us car rental business 
pursuant to the program  we dispose of vehicles and acquire replacement vehicles in a form intended to allow such dispositions and replacements to qualify as tax deferred like kind exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the program has resulted in deferral of federal and state income taxes for fiscal years   and and part of a lke program for herc has also been in place for several years 
the program allows tax deferral if a qualified replacement asset is acquired within a specific time period after asset disposal 
accordingly  if a qualified replacement asset is not purchased within this limited time period  taxable gain is recognized 
over the last few years  for strategic purposes  such as cash management and fleet reduction  we have recognized some taxable gains in the program 
in  the bankruptcy filing of an original equipment manufacturer  or oem  also resulted in minimal gain recognition 
we had sufficient net operating losses to fully offset the taxable gains recognized 
we cannot offer assurance that the expected tax deferral will continue or that the relevant law concerning the programs will remain in its current form 
an extended reduction in our car rental fleet could result in reduced deferrals in the future  which in turn could require us to make material cash payments for federal and state income tax liabilities 
our inability to obtain replacement financing as our fleet financing facilities mature would likely result in an extended reduction in the fleet 
in the event of an extended fleet reduction  we believe the likelihood of making material cash tax payments in the near future is low because of our significant net operating losses 
in august  we elected to temporarily suspend the us car rental lke program allowing cash proceeds from sales of vehicles to be utilized for various business purposes  including paying down existing debt obligations  future growth initiatives and for general operating purposes 
purchases of vehicles will continue to be funded with a combination of asset backed securitizations  asset based revolving credit facilities and corporate liquidity 
enacted legislation  effective september through december  will result in the lke suspension having a neutral effect on our taxes 
the new law allows bonus depreciation for qualified asset acquisitions during the period the law is effective 
recognized tax gains on vehicle dispositions resulting from the lke suspension were mainly offset by tax depreciation on newly acquired vehicles 
our federal net operating loss position for us tax purposes will not be adversely effected when the lke program is re instated 
the timing of reinstating the lke program is under continued analysis 
for a discussion of risks related to our reliance on asset backed financing to purchase cars  see item a risk factors included in this annual report 
on january   bank of america acquired merrill lynch co  inc  the parent company of bamlcp 
accordingly  bank of america is now an indirect beneficial owner of our common stock held by bamlcp and certain of its affiliates 
for us income tax purposes the transaction  when combined with other unrelated transactions during the previous months  resulted in a change in control as that term is defined in section of the internal revenue code 
consequently  utilization of all pre us net operating losses is subject to an annual limitation 
the limitation is not expected to result in a loss of net operating losses or have a material adverse impact on taxes 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued employee retirement benefits pension we sponsor defined benefit pension plans worldwide 
pension obligations give rise to significant expenses that are dependent on assumptions discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
our worldwide pre tax pension expense was approximately million  which is a decrease of million from the decrease in expense compared to is primarily due to the curtailment gain for the uk plan 
the funded status ie  the dollar amount by which the projected benefit obligations exceeded the market value of pension plan assets of our us qualified plan  in which most domestic employees participate  improved as of december   compared with december  because asset values increased due to gains in the securities markets 
we contributed million to our us pension plan during and expect to contribute between million and million to our us pension plan during these contributions are necessary primarily because of the plans under funded status 
we participate in various multiemployer pension plans 
in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans  then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump sum contribution to the plan  and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan s funding of vested benefits 
at least one multiemployer plan in which we participate is reported to have  and other of our multiemployer plans could have  significant underfunded liabilities 
such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability 
in addition  such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies
