item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we believe we are the largest manufacturer of private label salad dressings  powdered drink mixes  and instant hot cereals in the united states and canada  and the largest manufacturer of non dairy powdered creamer and pickles in the united states  based upon total sales volumes 
in  based on available industry data  private label products sold in the retail grocery channel in the united states  which compete with branded products on the basis of equivalent quality at a lower price  represented approximately of all shelf stable pickle products  approximately of all non dairy powdered creamer  approximately of all salad dressings and approximately of all canned soup 
we sell our products primarily to the retail grocery and foodservice channels 
for the year ended december   sales to the retail grocery and foodservice channels represented and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
the remaining represented industrial and export sales 
a majority of our sales are private label products 
we intend to grow our business profitably through the following strategic initiatives expand partnerships with retailers as grocery retailers become more demanding of their private label food product suppliers  they have come to expect strategic insight  product innovation  customer service and logistical economies of scale similar to those of our branded competitors 
to this end  we are continually developing  investing in and expanding our private label food product offerings and capabilities in these areas 
in addition to our low cost manufacturing  we have invested in research and development  product and packaging innovation  category management  information technology systems and other capabilities 
we believe that these investments enable us to provide a broad and growing array of private label food products that generally meet or exceed the value and quality of branded competitors that have comparable sales  marketing  innovation and category management support 
we believe that we are well positioned to expand our market share with grocery retailers given our differentiated capabilities  breadth of product offering and geographic reach 
continue to drive growth and profitability from our existing product portfolio we believe we can continue to drive organic growth from our existing product portfolio 
through insights gained from our economic value added eva analyses  we develop operating strategies that enable us to focus our resources and investments on products and categories that we believe offer the highest potential 
additionally  eva analyses identify products and categories that lag the broader portfolio and require corrective action 
we believe eva analysis is a helpful tool that maximizes the full potential of our product offerings 
leverage cross selling opportunities across customers  sales channels and geographies while we have high private label food product market shares in the united states for our non dairy powdered creamer  soup  salad dressing and pickles  as well as high branded and private label food product market share in jams in canada  we believe we still have significant potential for growth with grocery retailers and foodservice distributors that we either currently serve in a limited manner  or do not currently serve 
we believe that our size and scale give us an advantage over smaller private label food product producers  many of whom provide only a single category or service to a single customer or geography 
our ability to service customers across north america and across a wider spectrum of products and capabilities provides many opportunities for cross selling to customers who seek to reduce the number of private label food product suppliers they utilize 
growth through acquisitions we believe we have the expertise and demonstrated ability to identify and integrate value enhancing acquisitions 
we selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses that we believe are a compelling strategic fit with our existing operations 
each potential acquisition is vigorously evaluated for merit utilizing a rigorous analysis that assesses targets for their market attractiveness  intrinsic value and strategic fit 
we believe our acquisitions  which include the 
table of contents del monte soup and infant feeding business  san antonio farms  ed smith  sturm and st foods were each a success and consistent with our strategy 
since we began operating as an independent company in  our acquisitions have significantly added to our revenue base  enhanced margins and allowed us to expand from an initial base of two center of store  shelf stable food categories to twelve 
we attempt to maintain conservative financial policies when pursuing acquisitions and our proven integration strategies have resulted in rapid deleveraging 
by identifying targets that fit within our defined strategies  we believe we can continue to expand our product selection and continue our efforts to be the low cost  high quality and innovative supplier of private label food products for our customers 
the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and this should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and did not have any impairments 
for most of  the economy continued to show signs of weakness and uncertainty 
during the first half of  the company experienced significant increases in input costs that occurred at a faster rate than the company was able to pass along in price increases to customers 
this timing disparity was corrected by the end of the third quarter of when virtually all price increases were in effect 
as a result  gross margins were weaker in the first half of the year before recovering in the third quarter 
however  while we were able to increase prices  the company lost volume in the last quarter of the year as compared to the prior year  and incurred higher cucumber crop costs  an unfavorable lifo inventory adjustment for pickles and a shift in mix as we had higher sales of private label value products and lower sales of higher margin premium products  resulting in lower revenues and net income than the company had expected 
despite the challenges the company faced in  direct operating income increased over the prior year 
the company had no acquisitions in  however  we continue the pursuit of attractive acquisition targets 
the acquisition landscape in yielded opportunities and attractive acquisition targets  which resulted in the acquisition of sturm  for approximately million and st foods for approximately million 
during  the company successfully integrated these acquisitions into the existing business 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rates is primarily limited to the canadian dollar 
for the year  the company had a foreign currency gain of million due to fluctuations between the us and canadian currency exchange rates 
recent developments on january   the company repaid its cross border intercompany loans with its canadian subsidiary  ed smith 
the repayment totaled million and included both principal and interest 
payment was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the loans were fully repaid and canceled at the time of payment 
the cash will be held by ed smith in short term investments and will be used for general corporate purposes in canada  including capital projects and acquisitions 
the cash relates to foreign earnings  that if repatriated  would result in a tax liability 
on september   the company entered into amendment no 
amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and the 
table of contents group of other participating lenders 
the amendment  among other things  extends the maturity of the revolving credit facility to september   and adjusts the interest rates 
the interest rates under the credit agreement are based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio  and are determined by either libor plus a margin ranging from to or a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin ranging from to 
in addition  a facility fee ranging from to is due quarterly on the aggregate commitment under the revolving credit facility 
the aggregate commitment under the credit agreement remains at million  of which million was available as of december  on february   the company announced plans to close its pickle plant in springfield  missouri

direct selling and marketing was million in and known trends and uncertainties the costs of raw materials  ingredients  packaging materials and fuel  have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
we experienced increases in costs of most raw materials  ingredients and packaging materials in compared to in addition  fuel costs  which represent the most important factor affecting utility costs at our production facilities  as well as our transportation costs  rose significantly in we expect the volatile nature of these costs to continue with an overall upward trend 
we manage the impact of cost increases  wherever possible  on commercially reasonable terms  by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements 
in addition  we offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to our customers 
however  for competitive reasons  we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them 
in the first half of  the company experienced significant increases in input costs which occurred at a faster rate than the company was able to pass along in price increases to customers 
this timing disparity was corrected by the end of the third quarter of  when virtually all such price increases were in effect 
as a result  gross margins were weaker in the first half of the year before recovering in the third quarter 
in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into purchases at higher costs 
competitive environment there has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years  and mass merchandisers and non traditional grocers such as those offering a limited assortment are gaining market share 
as our customer base continues to consolidate  we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer  large customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing 
table of contents customers  or gain new customers 
as the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industry continues  we could lose sales and profits if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold or if limited assortment stores reduce the variety of products that we sell 
both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment in the retail and foodservice channels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
consistent with our strategy  our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates 
there has been a consolidation trend in the food manufacturing industry and competition for acquisition candidates continues to intensify 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating  investing and financing activities 
the company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position  with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses  acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long term basis 
over the last three years  the company has generated million in cash flow from operating activities due to strong earnings and by focusing on working capital management 
if additional borrowings are needed  approximately million was available on the revolving credit facility as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility

the decrease in cash from operating activities is due to an increase in working capital primarily from an increase in inventories and a reduction in payables and accrued expenses due to a reduction in incentive compensation and acquisition liabilities 
the increase in inventories is due to higher input costs and higher inventory levels due to lower fourth quarter sales 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in net income excluding non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization

the st foods acquisition was financed through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
financing activities in consisted of normal borrowing and repayments under our line of credit 
the company believes it has sufficient liquidity with the availability under the revolving credit facility and does not anticipate a significant risk to cash flows in the foreseeable future despite the current disruption of the credit markets  as the company operates in a relatively stable industry and has sizable market share across its product lines 
the company s long term financing needs will depend largely on potential acquisition activity 
the company contributed million  million and million in  and respectively to its pension plan  and expects to make contributions of approximately million in 
table of contents a portion of the company s cash is generated by the earnings of our canadian operations 
the company has asserted that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested in canada and  accordingly  are not available to fund us operating activities 
if the company were to repatriate these funds we would be required to pay us income taxes 
however  a determination of the potential tax liability is not practical at this time 
as a temporary measure  the company established a series of short term intercompany loans from the canadian operations to the us the cash was used to pay down the company s revolving line of credit and reduce the overall interest expense of the consolidated group 
the balance of the intercompany loans  principal and interest  at december  was million 
on january   the company repaid the cross border intercompany loans in full and canceled the related notes 
payment was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the cash will be held by our canadian subsidiary  ed smith  in short term investments and will be used for general corporate purposes in canada  including capital projects and acquisitions 
repayment of the intercompany loans will not impact the company s compliance with loan covenants and is not expected to significantly impact the company s access to liquidity 
after repaying the intercompany loans on january   the company had access to million under the revolving line of credit  which is sufficient to fund ongoing us operations  for no less than twelve months  as well as acquisitions 
seasonality the company s short term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital during the year 
as the company continues to add new product categories to our portfolio  spikes in financing needs are lessened 
cucumber and fruit production are driven by harvest cycles  which occur primarily during the spring and summer as inventories of pickles and jams generally are at a low point in late spring and at a high point during the fall  increasing our working capital requirements 
in addition  the company builds inventories of salad dressings in the spring and soup in the summer months in anticipation of large seasonal shipments that begin in the second and third quarters  respectively

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets totaled  million as of december   resulting primarily from acquisitions 
upon acquisition  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including but not limited to trademarks and customer related intangible assets  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks are not amortized 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  our reporting units are defined as north american retail grocery us  north american retail grocery canada  food away from home us  food away from home canada  industrial  home us and contract canada 
we believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
if these perpetual trademark criteria are not met  the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives 
determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment  market share  trademark history and anticipated future trademark support 
indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently  if other events occur  to ensure that fair value continues to exceed the related book value 
an indefinite lived trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds fair value 
goodwill impairment is indicated if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
if the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value  the asset is written down to fair value  which is generally based on its discounted future cash flows 
future business results could impact the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the company completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis as of december  our assessment did not result in an impairment 
we have seven reporting units  five of which contain goodwill totaling  million 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach  with each method given equal weighting 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied  with the weighted average of all discount rates being equal to the total company discount rate 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
further supporting our assessment of goodwill is the fact that our stock price has increased from december  to december  by approximately 
of the five reporting units with goodwill  all have fair values significantly in excess of their carrying values between and 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
we reviewed our indefinite lived intangible assets  which include our trademarks totaling million  using the relief from royalty method 
significant assumptions include the royalty  growth and discount rates 
our assumptions were based on historical performance and management estimates of future performance  as well as available data on licenses of similar products 
our analysis resulted in no impairment 
the company s policy is that indefinite lived assets must have a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
when these criteria are no longer met  the company changes the classification 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 

table of contents amortizable intangible assets  which include primarily customer relationships and trademarks  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment  the asset is written down to its fair value  which is generally based on discounted future cash flows 
no impairment was identified and the company concluded no changes are necessary to the remaining useful lives or values of the remaining amortizable intangible assets as of december  purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
all identifiable assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the purchase price of the acquired company  normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
we record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation 
to the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations  such differences would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including quoted market prices  forecast of expected cash flows  net realizable values  estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period  which would have an impact on our earnings 
future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
stock based compensation income from continuing operations before income taxes  for the years ended december  and december   included share based compensation expense for employees and directors of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock unit awards and performance units the awards is determined on the date of grant 
stock options were valued using a black scholes model 
performance units and all other restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards were valued using the closing price of the company s stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded  could have been impacted  if other assumptions were used 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be impacted in future periods 
expected volatilities for are based on historical volatilities of the company s stock price 
prior to  expected volatilities were based on the implied historical volatilities from peer companies and other factors  as the company s stock was not publically traded prior to june  the company has estimated that certain employees will complete the required service conditions associated with certain awards 
for all other employees  the company estimates forfeitures as not all employees are expected to complete the required service conditions 
the expected service period is the longer of the derived service period  as determined from the output of the valuation models  and the service period based on the term of the awards 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
as the company does not have significant history to determine the expected term of its option awards  we based the expected term on that of comparable companies 
the assumptions used to calculate the option and restricted stock awards granted in are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents insurance accruals we retain selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers having high deductible limits 
in other areas  we are self insured with stop loss coverage 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors that contemplate a number of variables  including claims history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are based on industry factors and  along with the estimated liabilities  are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
changes in loss development factors  claims history and cost trends could result in substantially different results in the future 
employee benefit plan costs we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends  when it is deemed appropriate 
as required by gaap  the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
our current asset mix guidelines  under our investment policy as written by our investment committee the investment committee  target equities at to of the portfolio and fixed income at to 
at december   our master trust was invested as follows equity securities of  fixed income securities of  and cash and cash equivalents of 
we determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plan s investments based on target allocations of the pension plan s investments 
additionally  we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model and historical returns on comparable equity  debt and other investments 
the resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 
while a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature  including assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and mortality rates  gaap require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions 
as such  our discount rate will likely change more frequently 
we used a discount rate to determine our estimated future benefit obligations of at december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee pension and retirement benefit plans 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations the company entered into a million long term interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of november  to lock into a fixed libor interest rate base 
under the terms of the agreement  million in floating rate debt was swapped for a fixed interest base rate for a period of months  amortizing to million for an additional nine months at the same interest rate 
this swap agreement expired august  
table of contents in july  we entered into a forward interest rate swap transaction for a notational amount of million as a hedge of the forecasted private placement of million in senior notes 
the interest rate swap transaction was terminated on august   which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the unamortized loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the total loss will be reclassified ratably to the consolidated statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the senior notes  providing an effective interest rate of over the terms of the senior notes 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hold any derivative financial instruments  other than our foreign currency contracts and commodity swap agreements as of december   which could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase in the amount of interest expense we expect to pay with respect to our revolving credit facility  which is tied to variable market rates which includes libor and prime interest rates 
based on our outstanding debt balance of million under our revolving credit facility as of december   each rise in our interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
input costs the costs of raw materials  as well as packaging materials and fuel  have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
we experienced increases in costs of most raw materials  ingredients and packaging materials in compared to in addition  fuel costs  which represent the most important factor affecting utility costs at our production facilities and our transportation costs  rose significantly in we expect the volatile nature of these costs to continue with an overall upward trend 
we use a significant amount of fruits and vegetables in our operations as raw materials 
certain of these fruits and vegetables are purchased under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers strategically located to supply our production facilities 
bad weather or disease in a particular growing area can damage or destroy the crop in that area 
if we are unable to buy the fruits and vegetables from local suppliers  we would purchase them from more distant locations  including other locations within the united states  mexico or india  thereby increasing our production costs 
changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials 
competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials  packaging and fuel costs 
accordingly  if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material  packaging and fuel costs  our operating profits and margins could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into pricing at higher costs
