you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are a biodefense company engaged in the development and commercialization of next generation medical countermeasures against biological and chemical threats 
our biodefense portfolio as of december  included the following product candidates sparvax  a second generation recombinant protective antigen rpa anthrax vaccine  valortim  a fully human monoclonal antibody for the prevention and treatment of anthrax infection  and rbche recombinant butyrylcholinesterase  countermeasures for nerve agent poisoning by organophosphorous compounds  including nerve gases and pesticides 
in addition  we were awarded by the delaware court of chancery in september the right to receive of all net profits related to the sale of siga technologies  inc st and related products for years following initial commercial sale of the drug once siga earns million in net profits from sales of st and related products 
siga has appealed this decision to the delaware supreme court  which appeal is still pending 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate our revenue from three different types of contractual arrangements cost plus fee contracts  fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable grants 
costs consist primarily of actual internal labor charges and external subcontractor costs incurred plus an allocation of applied fringe benefits  overhead and general and administrative expenses as defined in the contract 
revenues on cost plus fee contracts are recognized in an amount equal to the costs incurred during the period plus an estimate of the applicable fee earned 
the estimate of the applicable fee earned is determined by reference to the contract if the contract defines the fee in terms of risk based milestones and specifies the fees to be earned upon the completion of each milestone  then the fee is recognized when the related milestones are earned under the milestone method of revenue recognition 
otherwise  we compute fee income earned in a given period by using a proportional performance method based on costs incurred during the period as compared to total estimated project costs and application of the resulting fraction to the total project fee specified in the contract 
under the milestone method of revenue recognition  substantive milestone payments  including milestone payments for fees  contained in research and development arrangements under our contracts with the us government are recognized as revenue when i the milestones are achieved  ii no further performance obligations with respect to the milestone exist  iii collection is reasonably assured  and iv substantive effort was necessary to achieve the milestone 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met it is commensurate with either our performance to meet the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone  it relates solely to past performance  and the value of the milestone is reasonable relative to all the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement 
if a milestone is deemed not to be substantive  the company recognizes the portion of the milestone payment as revenue that correlates to work already performed  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is deferred and recognized as revenue as the company completes its performance obligations 
for fixed price contracts with the us government without substantive milestones as described above  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for long term contracts 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as the contract progresses  recognition of revenue and profits generally related to the costs incurred in providing the services required under the contract 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on the ability to make reasonable dependable estimates 
the fact that circumstances may necessitate frequent revision of estimates does not indicate that the estimates are unreliable for the purpose for which they are used 
estimating is an integral part of our business activities  and we may have to revise estimates on contracts continually as the work progresses 
we analyze each cost reimbursable grant to determine whether we should report such reimbursements as revenue or as an offset to our expenses incurred 
in and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of costs reimbursed by the government as an offset to research and development expenses 
our revenue generating contracts may include multiple elements  including one or more of up front license fees  research payments  and milestone payments 
in these situations  we allocate the total contract price to the multiple elements based on their relative fair values and recognize revenue for each element according to its characteristics 
as revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the contracts  related amounts are recorded as unbilled accounts receivable  the primary component of other receivables including unbilled receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 
as specific contract invoices are generated and sent to our customers  invoiced amounts are transferred out of unbilled accounts receivable and into billed accounts receivable 
invoicing frequency and payment terms for cost plus fee contracts with our customers are defined within each contract  but are typically monthly invoicing with to day payment cycles 
at december   unbilled accounts receivable were million 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred  advance payments are deferred and expensed as performance occurs 
research and development costs include salaries  facilities expense  overhead expenses  material and supplies  pre clinical expense  clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing expenses  stock based compensation expense  contract services and other outside services 
share based payments we have a long term incentive plan the ltip under which options to purchase shares of our common stock may be granted to employees  consultants and directors at a price no less than the quoted market value on the date of grant 
the ltip also provides for awards in the form of stock appreciation rights  restricted or unrestricted stock awards  stock equivalent units or performance based stock awards 
we account for share based awards to employees and non employee directors pursuant to fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  which requires that compensation cost resulting from share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value over the service period 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the fair value method requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
we use the black scholes merton model to estimate the fair value of our option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including grant price  the risk free interest rate  the estimated term of the option and the estimated future volatility of the option 
the estimated term and estimated future volatility of the options require our judgment 
intangible assets and goodwill in all of the patents associated with protexia were written down by approximately million associated with the decision to shut down the canadian operation upon the expiration of the protexia contract with the dod 
there were no patents capitalized as of december  and december  goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets associated with acquisitions 
we review the market value of the company as set by its stock price and the number of outstanding shares as of the end of the year 
if that value is greater than the net book value of the company s equity  no further analysis is needed 
changes in the company s business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact the impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over its estimated fair value 
results of operations revenue we recognized revenue of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our revenue was derived primarily from contracts with the us government for the development of sparvax and valortim 
our revenue for the year ended december  changed from primarily due to the following under our contract for the development of sparvax  we recognized approximately million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in revenue for the sparvax program during is attributable to additional work in preparation and execution of the scale up campaign at our us based sparvax bulk drug substance manufacturer as well as an increase in our billing rate to the customer 
additional activities related to the establishment of analytical and stability indicating assays for characterization of the product 
of the revenue amounts set forth above  million in and million in represent substantive milestone payments that were tied to our successful achievement of certain technical activities 
under the september contract for the advanced development of valortim  we recognized approximately million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue in reflects both clinical and non clinical work following the release of the fda partial clinical hold in december final patient dosing in clinical trial was completed in april and the in life portion of the trial ended in the third quarter revenue in was largely attributable to reimbursement of costs related to clinical and non clinical studies  including work in connection with the investigation related to the partial clinical hold and certain manufacturing related activities 
the current government contract funding from niaid of valortim development activities ended january  barda has told us that it does not believe it will have funds to support further work on valortim during the government s fiscal year ending september   and thus future government funding for valortim is unlikely in the near term and remains uncertain 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in obtaining additional financial support for this program 
under the september contract for the advanced development of protexia  we recognized approximately million in the year ended december   of which million in represent substantive milestone payments that were tied to our successful achievement of certain technical activities 
the decline in revenue is attributed to completion of major development activities for this program in past years 
we generated additional revenue of million under the million august fixed price contract with the dod for the development of the aes for rbche  our nerve agent medical countermeasure  in the year ended december  research and development expenses our research and development expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for both periods  these expenses resulted from research activities required for the development of the valortim and sparvax programs as well as to a much lesser extent from activities related to protexia in the first quarter direct expenses included salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies  and an allocation of indirect expenses 
we also incurred third party costs  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs for individual projects 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were net of cost reimbursements under certain of our government grants of million and million  respectively 
included in the grants were million in therapeutic discovery tax grants 
research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were attributable to research programs as follows years ended december  in millions anthrax therapeutic and vaccines chemical nerve agent protectants recombinant dual antigen plague vaccine internal research and development total research and development expenses for the year ended december   research and development expenses increased million from the prior year 
this change was primarily due to the increased technical activity and the achievement of key technical milestones on our sparvax program and the completion of the phase i valortim dose escalation clinical trial partially offset by a decrease in development expenses related to the clinical nerve agent protectants program as a result of the december  shut down of the protexia program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative functions include executive management  finance and administration  government affairs and regulations  corporate development  human resources  legal  and compliance 
for each function  we may incur expenses such as salaries  supplies and third party consulting and other external costs and non cash expenditures such as expense related to stock option and restricted share awards 
an allocation of facilities  utilities and other administrative overhead is also included in general and administrative expenses 
expenses associated with general and administrative functions were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  from the prior year period was a result of a million reduction in bad debt expense  a property loss insurance reimbursement of million partially offset by an increase in non cash stock compensation expenses as well as taxes and other expenses 
the bad debt expenses in consisted primarily of provisions associated with an invoice to our us government customer for the work at avecia as well as the wind down of the third generation anthrax vaccine program 
depreciation and intangible amortization including impairment charges depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these expenses are lower in primarily as a result of the impairment charge taken in december of million with the closing of our canadian operations 
other income expense other income expense primarily consists of income on our investments  interest expense on our debt and other financial obligations  changes in market value of our derivative financial instruments  and foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
we incurred interest expense of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense for primarily relate to the settlement with avecia for termination of a subcontract agreement with that organization 
interest expense for relates primarily to interest on our then outstanding convertible notes  including the amortization of the debt discount arising from the allocation of fair value to the warrants issued in connection with such notes 
in november and december  our outstanding convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock with one note being redeemed for cash 
gain on sale of assets held for sale of million was the result of the sale of land and buildings associated with our canadian operations  which were closed in the change in the fair value of our derivative instruments was a decrease of our liability of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to an increase of our liability of approximately million for the year ended december  the fair value of these derivative instruments is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the decrease in fair value realized as of december  was primarily the result of the decrease in pharmathene s stock price from per share on december  to per share on december  liquidity and capital resources overview our primary cash requirements for are to fund our operations including our research and development programs and support our general and administrative activities 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  timing  amount and profitability of sales of st  if any  the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and any future change in our business strategy 
these cash requirements could change materially as a result of shifts in our business and strategy 
during and the first quarter  we implemented certain cost reduction activities that we believe will reduce our net operating cash needs for and significantly as compared to and as a result we currently anticipate that our current cash on hand and collection of accounts receivables at december  as well as cash to be collected from contract revenue under contracts currently in place will be sufficient to meet pharmathene s ongoing expenses and capital requirements through and into year since our inception  we have not generated positive cash flows from operations 
to bridge the gap between payments made to us under our government contracts and grants and our operating and capital needs  we have had to rely on a variety of financing sources  including the issuance of equity securities and convertible notes  proceeds from loans and other borrowings 
for the foreseeable future  we will continue to need these types of financing vehicles and potentially others to help fund our future operating and capital requirements 
the renewed turmoil affecting the global financial system has resulted in extreme volatility in the capital markets and is threatening to once again tighten the credit markets 
as a result  there can be no assurance that future funding will be available to us on reasonably acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  due to the us government s continuing substantial efforts to stabilize the economy  the us government may be forced or choose to reduce or delay spending in the biodefense field  which could decrease the likelihood of future government contract awards  the likelihood that the government will exercise its right to extend any of its existing contracts with us and or the likelihood that the government would procure products from us 
we have incurred cumulative net losses and expect to incur additional losses in conducting further research and development activities 
we do not have commercial products and  given the substantial costs relating to the development of pharmaceutical products  have relatively limited existing capital resources 
our plans with regard to these matters include continued development of our products as well as seeking additional funds to support our research and development efforts 
although we continue to pursue these plans  there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient future financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that we will be able to secure additional funding through government contracts and grants 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business and do not include any adjustments that might result if the carrying amount of recorded assets and liabilities are not realized 
sources and uses of cash cash  restricted cash and cash equivalents were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million decrease at december  was primarily due to a combination of a loss from operations of million  of which million were noncash  substantially offset by net proceeds of million from a registered direct public offering of common stock and warrants  as well as million related to the sale of assets in canada 
in april  july and november  we completed various public offerings of common stock and warrants 
in november and december  our outstanding convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock with one note being redeemed for cash 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  pharmathene received an insurance recovery of million  which has been recorded as an offset to operating expenses 
additionally  cash paid for interest in decreased to million from million paid out in further  revenue increased by million in as compared to  primarily due to the achievement of milestones in resulting in the recognition of million of revenue compared to million in net cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted upward for the change in market value of noncash derivative instruments of million  the sale of the assets held for sale for a net gain of million and depreciation of million 
this was additionally impacted by non cash stock option expense of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  decreases in unbilled accounts receivable of million  prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  and accounts payable of million and an increase in accrued expenses of million 
the change in market value of the derivative instruments primarily relates to the change in our stock price from per share at december  to per share at december  cash used in operations during the year ended december  reflects our net loss of million  adjusted downward for the change in market value of derivative instruments of million  non cash interest of million  bad debt expense of million  and non cash stock compensation expenses of million  decreases in unbilled accounts receivable of million and in accounts receivable of million  increases in depreciation and amortization of million including an impairment charge of million primarily associated with the write down of canadian assets  and an increase in accounts payable of million  and adjusted upward by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
the combined decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities of million resulted from the use of proceeds from the financings to partially pay down these balances 
investing activities the net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided of approximately million for the year ended december  investing activities in consisted primarily of the sale of the canadian farm operations 
investing activities for related primarily to liquidating investments to meet working capital requirements 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million provided by financing activities for the year ended december  in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a per share inclusive of warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable immediately at an exercise price of per share until the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance  which is june  we received gross proceeds of approximately million and net proceeds of approximately million in connection with this transaction 
net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  was the result of the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants in april and july and common stock in november in addition net cash provided from financing activities for the year ended december  includes the issuance of a  letter of credit in favor of a vendor 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following are contractual commitments at december  primarily associated with leases and research and development arrangements less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating facility leases    research and development agreements   total contractual obligations   this table does not include any royalty payments relating to future sales of products subject to license agreements the company has entered into in relation to its in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments
