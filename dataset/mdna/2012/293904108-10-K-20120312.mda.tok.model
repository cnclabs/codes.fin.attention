overview we are a biotechnology company dedicated to the research and development of innovative therapeutics for cancer patients with high unmet medical needs 
we are managed as a single operating unit 
our drug development programs utilize two platforms customized pegylation linker technology customized linker technology and third generation messenger ribonucleic acid mrna antagonists utilizing the locked nucleic acid lna technology 
we currently have four compounds in human clinical development peg sn  a pegylated version of the active metabolite of the cancer drug irinotecan  and mrna antagonists targeting hypoxia inducible factor hif  survivin  and the androgen receptor ar 
in addition  we have novel lna targets in various stages of preclinical research 
we receive royalty revenues from licensing arrangements with other companies related to sales of products developed using our proprietary customized linker technology primarily pegintron marketed by merck co  inc merck 
in order to better focus on our portfolio of innovative oncology programs  we divested our specialty pharmaceutical business comprised principally of what had previously been our products and contract manufacturing segments 
prior to the january  closing of the transaction  we were a biopharmaceutical company involved in the development  manufacture  and commercialization of medicines for patients with cancer and other life threatening conditions 
we operated in three business segments products  royalties  and contract manufacturing 
we had a portfolio of four marketed products oncaspar  for first line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia all  depocyt  for the treatment of lymphomatous meningitis  abelcet  for the treatment of invasive fungal infections  and adagen  for the treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease 
the contract manufacturing business involved the manufacture of products for other pharmaceutical companies 
the products and contract manufacturing segments constituted components of our business and the sale qualified for treatment as discontinued operations effective with the first quarter of accordingly  the operations and cash flows of the products and contract manufacturing segments have been eliminated from our reported continuing operations and have been classified as discontinued operations beginning in prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business also involved the sale of certain in process research and development associated with the divested products  which resulted in the potential receipt of certain contingent milestone payments  the potential receipt of certain royalties  and our provision of various transitional services to the purchaser 
each of these aspects of the transaction is discussed below in greater detail 
results of continuing operations in millions of dollars year ended december  revenues royalties sale of in process research and development contract research and development miscellaneous income total revenues operating expenses research and development pipeline research and development specialty and contracted services general and administrative general and administrative contracted services restructuring charge operating loss other expense income tax expense benefit loss from continuing operations overview the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business in january had numerous effects on our financial results and makes year to year comparisons and inferences regarding future trends difficult 
even after reclassifying the majority of revenues and expenses of the divested business as discontinued operations  several large and unique items remain that are reported as part of continuing operations but that are not expected to be recurring events the sale of in process research and development for million in and the related million milestone payment received in were part of the total sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business but are reported as part of continuing operations because we continue to operate as a research and development organization 
revenues from a transition services agreement entered into with the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business totaling million in contract research and development and the majority of miscellaneous income diminished significantly in and we expect no meaningful activity in operating expenses for research and development contracted services in largely represented the expenses incurred million in support of the transition services revenues mentioned above and also diminished significantly in to approximately million 
also in this caption are the expenses incurred by us prior to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business in support of the products we owned at that time million in and million in 
after taking these items and the restructuring charges of million and million in and  respectively  into account  visibility of the underlying trends we have experienced in royalty revenues  research and development spending and general and administrative expenses is enhanced 
these and other elements of our statements of operations are discussed more fully below 
royalty revenues in millions of dollars year ended december  change change royalty revenue the majority of royalty revenue relates to sales of pegintron  a peg enhanced version of the alpha interferon product  intron a  marketed by merck  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c 
other royalty revenues and certain licensing revenues relate to the application of our technology to third party products including those under a cross license agreement with nektar therapeutics  inc nektar under which we receive a share of the royalties and licensing income received by nektar 
there are currently two third party products for which nektar has granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology and for which we are participating in royalty and licensing income revenues ucb s cimzia for the treatment of crohn s disease and rheumatoid arthritis in the european union and osi and pfizer s macugen for the treatment of neovascular wet age related macular degeneration 
there were previously three products for which nektar had granted sublicenses to our pegylation technology  but our right to receive royalties on sales of pegasys ended  by contract  effective in october we are also entitled to royalties from the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business of to percent on incremental net sales through  above a baseline amount  from the four marketed products we sold to them 
royalty revenue declined approximately percent in compared to this was driven almost entirely by lower sales of pegintron  which also declined approximately percent during the same period 
in may  the us food and drug administration fda approved victrelis boceprevir  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c chc 
victrelis is approved for the treatment of chc genotype infection  in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin  in adult patients years of age and older with compensated liver disease  including cirrhosis  who are previously untreated or who have failed previous interferon and ribavirin therapy 
in addition  in may  the fda also approved incivek telaprevir to treat certain adults with chronic hepatitis c infection 
incivek is used for patients who have either not received interferon based drug therapy for their infection or who have not responded adequately to prior therapies 
incivek is approved for use in combination with peginterferon alfa and ribavirin 
we believe that the approval of these drugs may result in increased sales of pegintron in the future  however  we have no clear evidence at this point of what impact  if any  these new therapies for hepatitis c may have on sales of pegintron 
royalties on net sales of cimzia and macugen were relatively flat for versus  while royalties on the on net sales of the four divested marketed products declined by approximately year over year 
royalty revenue declined approximately percent in compared to this was primarily the result of declining sales of pegintron  which were percent lower during the same period 
further contributing to the full year decline was the absence of royalties from pegasys in  partially offset by growth in sales of cimzia 
macugen royalties were flat for the year 
during  we recognized for the first time royalties earned on net sales of products we divested as part of the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
our future revenues are heavily weighted towards royalties and revenues to be received from the use of our technology and are dependent upon numerous factors outside of our control 
we derive almost all of our royalties from sales of pegintron  which have been in decline since merck s obligation to pay us royalties on sales of pegintron terminates  on a country by country basis  upon the later of the date on which the last patent to contain a claim covering pegintron expires in the country or years after the first commercial sale of pegintron in such country 
currently  expirations of our right to receive royalties are expected to occur in in the us  in europe and in japan 
in  we sold a interest in pegintron royalties 
accordingly  amounts reflected above represent our share of total royalties remitted by merck 
the royalty sale agreement contained a provision under which we could receive an additional million in the first quarter of if the purchaser received a certain threshold of royalties on net sales of pegintron occurring from july  through december  as of december   this threshold was not reached and no additional payment is due from the purchaser 
other factors potentially affecting our royalty revenues include new or increased competition from products that may compete with the products for which we receive royalties  the effectiveness of marketing by our licensees  and new uses and geographies for pegintron  cimzia and macugen 
our rights to receive royalties on cimzia and macugen will terminate in non us revenue we recognized royalties on non us sales of million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which royalties recognized on sales in europe were million  million  and million  respectively 
our non us royalties are denominated in non us dollars and are included in total revenues 
sale of in process research and development when we sold our specialty pharmaceutical business  we retained our research and development organization 
we had been engaged in studies oriented towards the next generation formulations of oncaspar and adagen  two products that were among those sold as part of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
the in process research and development related to oncaspar and adagen was sold to the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business and  in connection with the sale  million was recognized as revenue in the first quarter of during the first quarter of  we earned and recognized an additional million milestone payment related to divested in process research and development 
the selling price of the in process research and development represented management s best estimate of its standalone fair value based on the stage of development and future milestone payment consideration 
all necessary technology and know how were transferred to the purchaser at the time of the sale and the purchaser could resell the in process research and development asset 
at the time of the sale  the activities necessary to complete the work on the oncaspar and adagen next generation formulations could have been performed by the purchaser or others 
contract research and development revenue pursuant to a transition services agreement entered into at the time of the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business  we began performing product support research and development  consulting and technology transfer functions for the purchaser effective with the close of the sale transaction on january  the transition services associated with product support research and development are being reported in continuing operations due to our ongoing involvement in the research and development related to the divested products 
we are being compensated for this work at actual cost plus a mark up per the terms of the transition services agreement 
revenue was generated from these services in the amount of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our contractual obligation is to assist with these transition services for a period of up to three years subsequent to the date of the sale  although the level of such activity declined significantly during and we do not expect meaningful activity or revenue under this transaction services agreement in miscellaneous income miscellaneous income includes rental receipts totaling approximately million and million in and  respectively  in connection with the sublease of unused manufacturing and excess office facilities for which we have ongoing lease commitments 
the underlying rental expense is reflected in general and administrative expense 
in addition  as part of the transition services agreement referred to above  we were compensated for various general and administrative services provided to the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
the compensation for this work includes reimbursement of costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the agreement 
approximately million and million have been earned for these services through december  and  respectively 
the expenses incurred in relation to these services are reported as general and administrative contracted services 
our involvement in the transitioning of general and administrative activities has essentially concluded during research and development expenses pipeline in millions of dollars year ended december  change change research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of contractor fees principally related to clinical projects  costs related to research and development collaborations or licenses  drug supplies for preclinical and clinical activities  salaries  stock based compensation and benefits  other research supplies and facilities charges 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased percent to million 
we invested in the following programs during peg sn spending on peg sn increased in as clinical activity increased in the phase ii metastatic colorectal cancer study  the phase ii metastatic breast cancer study  and the phase i pediatric study 
we completed enrollment in the phase ii trial for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
this study was designed to evaluate two groups of colorectal patients who have failed two prior therapies including irinotecan and oxaliplatin  those with k ras mutation and those that have non mutated k ras tumors 
the study enrolled approximately patients 
the non mutated k ras group was randomized into two arms one treated with peg sn in combination with erbitux and the other arm treated with irinotecan in combination with erbitux 
the phase ii study for patients with metastatic breast cancer was designed to evaluate the efficacy of single agent peg sn in two groups of patients who have received prior therapy regimens of anthracycline and taxane or anthracycline  taxane and xeloda 
irinotecan has been evaluated and shown to be active in patients with breast cancer 
all patients enrolled were treated with single agent peg sn  and enrollment was completed during we continued enrollment in our phase i study for pediatric patients with cancer 
this study is designed to find the recommended dose of peg sn in pediatric patients 
we expect to complete this phase i study in additionally  a phase i study of peg sn and bevacizumab at the national cancer institute  bethesda  md  in patients who failed multiple prior chemotherapy regimens is continuing to enroll patients 
we are currently seeking a strategic partner to further develop and commercialize peg sn absent such a partnership  we do not intend to fund further development of peg sn hif antagonist spending on the hif antagonist program remained unchanged for versus spending for was substantially lower than due to elevated costs experienced in for the production of clinical trial supplies 
enrollment was completed in the two phase i studies in patients with solid tumors and lymphoma to evaluate the safety of the hif mrna antagonist using two different dosing schedules 
in general  hif antagonist therapy has been well tolerated  and many patients have received multiple cycles 
we have observed tumor shrinkage in patients with renal cell cancer  liver cancer  sarcoma  and cancer of the tonsil 
a pilot study in patients with cancer in the liver is open at the national cancer institute 
survivin antagonist spending on the survivin mrna antagonist program decreased in versus spending on survivin in included a million milestone payment and the costs of production of clinical trial supplies 
comparable milestone payments and expenses of producing clinical trial materials were not incurred in enrollment was completed in our phase i study 
the study was designed to gain dose and safety information both as a single agent and in combination with taxotere 
androgen receptor ar antagonist spending on the ar mrna antagonist program declined in versus  when spending accelerated as enabling activities related to an investigational new drug ind were conducted 
this included toxicology and preclinical work that led to the filing and subsequent acceptance on an ind application in november in connection with the filing  we made a million milestone payment to santaris in the fourth quarter of additional lna targets under our agreement with santaris we will have the right to develop and commercialize rna antagonists directed against additional novel oncology gene targets selected by us 
we are evaluating these compounds in early preclinical studies 
any one of these compounds could be returned to santaris if the findings of our preclinical or clinical work do not support continued investigation 
in  we incurred milestone payments totaling million for the commencement of preclinical studies for three of our targets in addition to the million milestone payment for the ar antagonist ind referred to above 
in  there were no milestone payments due to santaris on our remaining targets 
research and development expenses specialty and contracted services expenses associated with generating contract research and development revenue amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
also included in the line caption are the million of costs for the period from january through january  incurred in our research and development activities related to the marketed products we previously owned 
spending for of million reflects a full year of these same costs 
this work was directed largely towards securing and maintaining a reliable supply of the ingredients used in the production of oncaspar and adagen  including development of new formulations of each 
general and administrative expenses in millions of dollars year ended december  change change general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for support functions  outside professional services for accounting  audit  tax  legal  and financing activities  patent filing fees and facilities costs 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million  down percent from the prior year 
the decline from the preceding year was largely the result of a restructuring program implemented in the fourth quarter of  which reduced the number of employees and therefore the associated payroll costs  as well as the effects of our on going cost containment efforts  including consolidation of facilities into the piscataway  new jersey location from our former bridgewater  new jersey headquarters facility 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were million  down percent from the prior year 
the reduction from the preceding year was largely due to the contraction of corporate services and overhead costs resulting from the first quarter sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
a significant portion of the year over year decrease is related to compensation 
the restructuring program implemented during the first quarter of and the resulting reduction in employees was reflected in lower payroll costs during the latter half of the year 
accelerated vesting of share based awards in the fourth quarter of resulted in a reduction in of the charges related to the vesting of these awards for all but certain senior management and board members 
offsetting these favorable influences on compensation expense in  in part  was the shift of a portion of the executive bonus expense recognition out of and into a fourth quarter adjustment was made to annual executive bonuses paying them one half in cash and one half in nonvested shares that vested over the twelve months of in addition to reductions in compensation expenses  we also made concerted efforts to reduce contracted services  accounting and consulting fees in during  certain general and administrative expenses were elevated  including legal costs related to a proposed shareholder consent solicitation and the post implementation costs of an enterprise resource planning erp computer software system 
as outlined above  we have made significant progress in reducing general and administrative expenses and will continue to seek and implement efficiencies that could potentially lead to further reductions 
however  the rate of improvement experienced during and is not expected to continue 
general and administrative expenses contracted services as part of the transition services agreement with the purchaser of the specialty pharmaceutical business  we provided certain general  administrative  financial  legal  human resource and information technology services for a period of up to one year 
we were compensated for these services based upon costs incurred plus a mark up defined in the transition services agreement 
during the years ended december  and  expenses associated with generating this revenue were approximately million and million  respectively 
this administrative support activity effectively concluded during restructuring as a result of our transition from a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with research  manufacturing and marketing operations to a biotechnology company dedicated to oncology research and development  we undertook reductions in our workforce during  and in connection with our decision to exit our former headquarters facility in bridgewater  new jersey  we also incurred lease related charges and wrote off certain furnishings and leasehold improvements in and we incurred the following costs in connection with our restructuring programs during the years ended december   and in thousands of dollars year ended december  employee separation benefits fourth quarter third quarter second quarter fourth quarter first quarter first quarter other restructuring costs total restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded total restructuring charges in the amount of million  of which million related to the departure of our chief operating officer for severance payments and benefits that are payable under the terms of the amended and restated severance agreement 
additionally  there were several research and development positions identified for elimination resulting in a charge of approximately million for separation benefits 
during the third quarter of  we announced a plan to reduce our workforce and operating costs to more closely align its resources and capital with our on going research and development activities 
the reduction in force will reduce the number of employees by approximately percent  to a total of approximately  by june separation payments will be made for up to a year following the respective separations 
we expect the reduction in force to result in approximately million in reduced annualized operating expenses once the plan is fully implemented by the second quarter of in connection with this restructuring  we recorded a charge of approximately million for separation benefits 
also during the third quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million to terminate an operating lease related to the third and first floors of our former bridgewater  new jersey headquarters facility 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million related to the departure of our executive vice president  human resources administration for severance payments and benefits that are payable under the terms of the severance and release agreement 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge in the amount of million related to the excess of committed lease costs over potential sublease income for office space in bridgewater  new jersey that was vacated during the quarter when the company relocated its corporate headquarters to piscataway  new jersey 
the fourth quarter restructuring program was part of our continued efforts to streamline corporate administrative operations and affected approximately employees 
the majority of the terminations occurred during the first quarter of  and separation payments will be made for up to a year following the respective separations 
in connection with this restructuring  the company recorded a charge of approximately million for separation benefits 
during the second quarter of  we wrote off certain leasehold improvements and furnishings located at our former headquarters facility in bridgewater  new jersey that were determined to be excess and without future value as a result of the termination and relocation of several employees 
the noncash charge related to this write off was approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for a portion of our excess corporate facilities 
these facilities became unused as a result of the reductions in workforce stemming from earlier restructuring efforts 
the charge of approximately million represents the excess of our contractual lease commitment over the amount of cash to be received from the subtenant over the life of the sublease arrangement during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million  of which million was for separation benefits resulting from a workforce reduction involving employees 
these actions related primarily to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business  including several employees who were previously engaged in activities related to the divested business but who did not transfer to the employment of the purchaser 
these employees were provided with separation benefits after certain transition periods during which they assisted with an orderly transfer of activities and information to the purchaser 
we also reassessed our staffing requirements subsequent to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business in light of the lessened demands on many of our general and administrative functions 
additionally  our former president and chief executive officer resigned from the company effective february   resulting in million of expenses for severance payments and benefits that were payable per the terms of the individual s employment agreement 
corporate restructuring costs associated with the workforce reduction amounted to million during the first quarter of this represents separation benefits and related costs of terminated employees in general and administrative areas as well as research and development 
other income expense in millions of dollars year ended december  change change other income expense investment income  net interest expense other than temporary investment impairment loss nm nm other  net nm not meaningful net other expense for the three years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the repurchase and conversion of a portion of our notes during the three year period affected the year to year comparisons in a number of ways see liquidity and capital resources below 
also  in  two significant items that tended to offset one another were the recognition of an impairment in an investment holding and recognition of an award of a government grant 
further discussion of each of the individual items follows 
net investment income in was million  a decline of versus earnings 
net investment income in was million  a decline of versus million earned in for the first three quarters of and for all of  as debt securities matured in our portfolio the proceeds were held in money market funds as opposed to being reinvested in additional debt securities 
the maturing higher yielding securities were purchased several years earlier when prevailing interest rates were higher for all classes of debt holdings 
as they matured  the proceeds were reinvested in lower yielding money market funds in a historically low interest rate environment 
during the fourth quarter of  we resumed investing excess cash in a portfolio of marketable debt securities  although at much lower rates than the previous portfolio was earning 
interest expense includes amortization and  when debt is repurchased  the write off of deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense has continued to decline over the three year period through  from million in to million in to million in  due primarily to the conversion in the first quarter of of million principal amount of our notes into shares of our common stock in connection with the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million in principal amount of our notes at par 
in  we repurchased million in principal amount of our notes 
the write off of deferred debt issuance costs was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
other than temporary impairment losses on available for sale investment holdings representing credit losses are charged to earnings 
we hold an investment in one auction rate security that we believe is more likely than not impaired due to the lack of credit worthiness of the issuer and its parent company 
consequently  the remaining carrying value of million was written off during the third quarter of other income in was not material to our results of operations 
other income in is primarily the receipt of a million federal government grant for qualifying therapeutic discovery investments made by us in and a significant portion of other income in relates to gains realized on the repurchase of notes payable 
during the first quarter of  we repurchased million in principal amount of our notes at a discount to par  yielding a gross gain of million  or million net of the write off of the related deferred debt issuance costs 
discontinued operations the cash proceeds received from the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business  including a second quarter working capital adjustment  amounted to approximately million 
of this amount  million was allocated to the sale of in process research and development and included in continuing operations 
the net proceeds then attributable to discontinued operations yielded a gain of million 
the results of operations of the specialty pharmaceutical business for the period in january preceding the sale amounted to income of million comprising the remainder of the reported in as income and gain from discontinued operations 
although the sale was a taxable event  no tax liability arose due to the basis we had in the underlying assets and the current year net operating loss 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we also were entitled to receive up to an additional million in milestone payments if certain conditions are met 
of this amount  we earned and received a million milestone payment in the first quarter of  and another million is no longer considered likely to be received 
there can be no assurance that we will receive any of the remaining million in milestone payments 
in addition  we may receive royalties of to percent on incremental net sales above a baseline amount of our then four marketed specialty pharmaceutical products through revenue from these milestones and or royalties is reflected as part of our continuing operations 
prior year results of operations of the specialty pharmaceutical business have been reclassified as discontinued operations for comparability 
income taxes income tax expense in was primarily comprised of foreign withholding taxes on repatriated funds 
no federal income tax expense was incurred in relation to normal operating results due either to current period operating losses or the utilization of deferred tax assets to offset taxes that would otherwise accrue to operating income 
federal legislation  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  which allowed us to make an election to treat certain unused research and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as refundable in lieu of claiming bonus and accelerated depreciation for eligible qualified property placed in service through the end of was extended to this provided us with a million benefit in the balance of the income tax benefit reflects a reduction of million to state taxes payable 
in november  federal legislation was enacted under which we are able to carryback our alternative minimum tax net operating losses to the five previous years to offset the alternative minimum taxes that were not available to us for carryback prior to the new legislation 
we recorded the impact of the carryback  estimated to be approximately million  in the fourth quarter of and received a federal income tax cash refund in the first quarter of other legislation in allowed us to make an election to treat certain unused research and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards as refundable in lieu of claiming bonus and accelerated depreciation for eligible qualified property placed in service through the end of this provided us with a million benefit in offsetting these two tax benefit amounts which total million was a million charge related to an adjustment of state taxes payable 
liquidity and capital resources cash reserves  including cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  totaled million as of december  and million as of december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to million  inclusive of transaction costs  used to repurchase shares of common stock and million used to repurchase notes outstanding 
cash used in operating activities of our continuing operations during was million  as compared to million of cash provided in as previously noted  during we disposed of our specialty pharmaceutical business which generated positive cash flows from operations 
therefore  the operating results in fully reflect the transition of the company from a specialty pharmaceutical business to a pure biotech company with primary emphasis on research and development 
the operating expenses incurred are partially funded by our royalty stream derived from sales of marketed products that utilize our proprietary technology 
cash used in investing activities amounted to million in as compared to cash provided by investing activities in which amounted to million 
the most significant reason for the fluctuation in this category is due to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business in  which generated cash proceeds of million 
in addition  in prior years  we were maintaining all proceeds from sale and maturities of marketable securities as cash and cash equivalents 
in the fourth quarter of  we resumed investing our cash and therefore  used net cash and cash equivalents of million to purchase marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities in amounted to million with the most significant transaction being the repurchase of our outstanding common stock which amounted to million representing million shares repurchased 
the purchases were made pursuant to a million share repurchase plan announced in december and  prior to that  a million share repurchase plan announced in december and completed in the fourth quarter of during the third quarter of  we decided to suspend the current million share repurchase program 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased million of our outstanding notes at par 
we intend to resume repurchasing shares of outstanding common stock under our million share repurchase program 
share repurchases under this program may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions at such times and in such amounts as we deems appropriate  based on a variety of factors such as price  corporate and regulatory requirements and overall market conditions 
there can be no assurance as to the number of shares we will purchase  if any 
the share repurchase program may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
as of december   the principal amount of the notes outstanding was million 
the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business in january constituted a fundamental change under the indenture governing the notes  which triggered a requirement that we offer to purchase all of the notes at face value 
on february   we initiated a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the notes at face value 
the offer expired on march  with no notes having been tendered 
the fundamental change also triggered a change in the conversion rate from shares per  principal amount of notes to shares per  principal amount of notes during the period january  to march  during this period  million principal amount of the notes were converted into approximately million shares of our common stock  reducing the principal balance of the notes outstanding to million 
subsequent to the march   the date the enhanced conversion period ended  the original conversion rate of shares per  principal amount is again in effect 
our current sources of liquidity are our cash reserves  interest earned on such cash reserves and royalties primarily those related to sales of pegintron 
in january  we earned and received a million milestone payment in connection with the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business 
no further milestones related to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business are expected in  and there can be no assurance that any of these milestones will be received in the future 
based upon our current planned research and development activities and related costs  our current sources of liquidity  the expected cash outflows from operations and the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock remaining from the previously announced million share repurchase program  we anticipate our current cash reserves will be sufficient to meet our capital and operational requirements for the near future 
while we believe that our current sources of liquidity will be adequate to satisfy our capital and operational needs for the near future  it is likely that we will need to obtain additional financing or enter into a collaborative arrangement to sustain our research and development efforts prior to the time we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain additional funds or engage a collaborator on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or collaborative support  we may be required to curtail our research and development activities and or license our product candidates to third parties 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet special purpose entity transactions 
our notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
at december   the potential dilutive effect of conversion of the notes was million shares using the conversion price of per share or shares per  principal amount of notes 
in addition  stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share and million restricted stock units were outstanding at december   which represent additional potential dilution 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations and commercial commitments notes payable due june  operating lease obligations interest due on notes payable totals does not include potential milestone payments of million to santaris that are only payable upon successful development of all five mrna targets selected by us 
does not include separation payments and benefits of approximately million to be made to exiting employees in connection with the restructurings 
does not include lease revenues to be received pursuant to certain subleased facilities 
as of december   we had million of convertible senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these notes mature on june  unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or converted 
the notes rank equal to all future senior unsecured debt 
if the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the consecutive trading day period ending on the date one day prior to the date of a notice of redemption is greater than percent of the applicable conversion price on the date of such notice  we  at our option  may redeem the notes in whole or in part  at a redemption price in cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued interest  if any  to the redemption date 
we lease three facilities in new jersey 
future minimum lease payments and commitments for operating leases total million at december  in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease of a portion of the office space located in bridgewater  new jersey 
the company terminated the third and first floor portions of the leased space during the third and fourth quarters of respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the us all applicable us gaap accounting standards effective as of december  have been taken into consideration in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following accounting policies and estimates have been highlighted as significant because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates  to the extent possible  on historical experience 
historical information is modified as appropriate based on current business factors and various assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis and make changes when necessary 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenues royalties under our license agreements with third parties and pursuant to the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized when reasonably determinable and earned through the sale of the product by the third party and collection is reasonably assured 
notification from the third party licensee of the royalties earned under the license agreement is the basis for royalty revenue recognition 
this information generally is received from the licensees in the quarter subsequent to the period in which the sales occur 
contingent payments due under the asset purchase agreement related to the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business are recognized as income when the milestone has been achieved and collection is assured 
such payments are non refundable  and no further effort is required on the part of the company or the other party to complete the earning process 
non refundable payments received upon entering into license and other collaborative agreements where we have continuing involvement are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the estimated service period 
the sale of the specialty pharmaceutical business involved the application of guidance regarding multiple deliverables in separating the revenues associated with the sale of in process research and development from the other elements of the transaction  namely the assets sold as part of discontinued operations and our continuing involvement in contract research activities 
we determined that the in process research and development had value to the buyer of the specialty pharmaceutical business on a stand alone basis and that there was objective and reliable evidence available to support the allocation of the total purchase price to the respective units of accounting 
research and development expenses we accrue expenses for costs for work performed by contract research organizations  contract manufacturing organizations and others based upon the estimated amount of the total effort completed on each order  study or project using factors such as number of lots produced  number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the study 
we base the estimates on the information available at the time 
additional information may come available at a later date that would enable us to develop a more accurate estimate 
such changes in estimate are generally recognized in the period when the information is first known 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets is provided for when it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   we believe  based on projections  that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets  including our net operating losses from operating activities and stock option exercises  will not be realized 
we recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position that we have taken or expect to take on the income tax returns we file if it is more likely than not we will be able to sustain our position 
stock based compensation compensation cost  measured by the fair value of the equity instruments issued  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is recognized in the financial statements as the respective awards are earned 
the impact that share based payment awards will have on our results of operations is a function of the number of shares awarded  vesting and the trading price and fair value of our stock at date of grant or modification 
fair value of share based payments is determined using the black scholes valuation model which employs weighted average assumptions for expected volatility of our stock  expected term until exercise of the options  the risk free interest rate  and dividends  if any 
expected volatility is based on our historical stock price information
