natural catastrophe activity also impacted our underwriting results in 
table of contents  though to a lesser extent and primarily impacting our reinsurance segment  we recognized estimated pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for the september new zealand earthquake new zealand i and million for the chilean earthquake 
our insurance segment s underwriting income included million in pre tax net losses inclusive of related premiums to reinstate reinsurance protection related to the events noted above  of this amount million  million  million and million  respectively  related to the series of us storms in april may  the thai flooding  the japanese earthquake and tsunami and new zealand ii 
higher acquisition costs and a million reduction in net favorable prior period reserve development also contributed to the reduction in underwriting income  while reductions in ceded reinsurance costs and increases in gross premiums written contributed to higher net premiums earned and partially offset these reductions 
the majority of our natural catastrophe related losses emanated from our reinsurance segment and drove the underwriting loss for the year 
included in the underwriting loss are aggregate pre tax net losses net of related reinstatement premiums of million for the events noted above  with the most significant amounts being million for new zealand ii  million for the japanese earthquake and tsunami and million for the first quarter australian weather events 
as noted above  substantially all of our natural catastrophe related pre tax net losses in emanated from the reinsurance segment 
a million reduction in net favorable prior period reserve development also contributed to the variance 
versus total underwriting income was million for  a decrease of from underwriting results in our insurance segment benefited from a substantially reduced level of claim activity in our credit and political risk lines  as well as the continued consideration of our own loss experience in establishing our current accident year loss ratios  most notably for professional lines 
reduced ceded reinsurance costs due to the restructuring of certain programs on renewal in the second quarter of increased net premiums earned 
these factors were partially offset by a million reduction in net favorable prior period reserve development and increases in acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the segment s underwriting results were not impacted by our indemnity contract exposed to longevity risk 
during  we recognized net losses of million in relation to this contract  which was cancelled during the fourth quarter of that year 
the reduction in underwriting income for our reinsurance segment was primarily the result of the previously discussed net losses incurred as a result of the chilean earthquake and new zealand i 
in addition  we recognized net losses for a number of other notable weather related events  including the first quarter australian storms and european windstorm xynthia  numerous us storms throughout the year  and the fourth quarter australian floods 
in contrast  catastrophe activity was notably less significant in partially offsetting this increase in natural catastrophe losses was a lower level of claims activity in our trade credit and bond line of business in net investment income versus net investment income decreased million  largely due to a reduction in income from our alternative investment portfolio other investments  during  we recognized modest negative returns from our hedge and credit funds  whereas returns were positive for in addition  income from our fixed maturities was million lower in continued declines in reinvestment yields  primarily due to lower us and european risk free rates  were the primary driver  however  the impact was partially offset by widening credit spreads and growth in our asset base driven by the investment of net cash flows from operations 
versus the million decrease in primarily resulted from lower reinvestment yields on our fixed maturity portfolio 
our other investments also contributed to the decrease  although these investments performed well in both years  our hedge funds and credit funds generated higher returns in 
table of contents net realized investment gains losses volatility and turmoil in the global financial markets during led to a million impairment charge on our available for sale afs investments  this amount included a million other than temporary impairment otti charge on a portfolio of medium term notes mtns  where we no longer expected to fully recover amortized costs based on updated cash flow projections 
the subsequent recovery in global financial market conditions led to improved valuations for fixed maturities and equities  a portion of which we realized in and while realized gains in were driven by credit spread tightening  the corresponding amount in was largely driven by the reductions in risk free rates noted above 
other expenses revenues  net the movements in other revenues and expenses were primarily due to foreign exchange rate movements 
depreciation in the euro and the sterling against the us dollar resulted in foreign exchange gains of million and million  respectively  on the remeasurement of our non us dollar net insurance related liabilities during and  appreciation in these currencies drove a million loss recognized in our income tax expense for was million lower than for  largely due to the reduction in net income driven by catastrophe losses 
an increase in interest expense following our march senior note issuance contributed to the higher expense levels for when compared with outlook following several years of price reductions across many property and casualty lines and a near record year in terms of global catastrophes and amid declining investment yields and an uncertain global economic environment  we believe the industry is in the early stages of a cycle change  where we anticipate that pricing adequacy will improve over the next few years 
currently  however  conditions are mixed  with increases in certain lines and markets while others are stable or still in negative territory 
we intend to remain selective in our approach to risk 
on the asset side  the persistence of the low interest rate environment continues to pressure our investment returns 
we will continue to evaluate the risk and return characteristics of our existing business  as well as emerging opportunities  and focus on lines of business where we find the most attractive opportunities 
financial measures we believe the following financial indicators are important in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value we generate for our common shareholders year ended and at december  roace operating roace dbv per common share cash dividends declared per common share return on average common equity roace is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders for the period by the average shareholders equity determined by using the common shareholders equity balances at the beginning and end of the period 
operating roace is calculated by dividing operating income loss for the period by the average common shareholders equity determined by using the common shareholders equity balances at the beginning and end of the period 
operating roace is a non gaap financial measure  as defined in sec regulation g 
see non gaap financial measures for additional information and a reconciliation to the nearest gaap financial measure roace 
diluted book value dbv represents total common shareholders equity divided by the number of common shares and diluted common share equivalents outstanding  determined using the treasury stock method 

table of contents return on equity our objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward our common shareholders for the risks we assume and to grow revenue only when we expect the returns will meet or exceed our requirements 
we recognize that the nature of underwriting cycles and the frequency or severity of large loss events in any one year may make it difficult to achieve a profitability target in any specific period and  therefore  established a roace target of over the full underwriting cycle 
our average annual roace since inception is approximately  tracking closely to our long term goal 
versus our underwriting loss  driven by catastrophe related losses  was the primary driver of the negative operating roace for  reductions in net favorable prior period reserve development and net investment income also contributed to a lower return when compared to in addition to the changes noted above for operating roace  roace also includes net realized gains and foreign exchange gains 
our combined net realized and foreign exchange gains for were sufficient to recognize net income for the period  as such  our roace for the year was marginally positive 
versus our operating income was also adversely impacted by a higher level of catastrophe activity relative to the previous year  as well as reductions in net favorable prior period development and net investment income 
however  these factors were partially offset by a comparative absence of charges related to our indemnity contract exposed to longevity risk following the cancellation of that contract in our average common equity increased  also contributing to the reduction in the return 
the increase in average common equity was driven by a global recovery in financial markets and our net income available to common shareholders  these increases were partially offset by more significant common share repurchases 
as net realized gains and losses and therefore roace includes the impact of otti charges  improvement in our roace relative to was primarily due to the substantial reduction in otti charges 
diluted book value per common share we consider dbv per common share to be an appropriate measure of our returns to common shareholders  as we believe growth in our book value on a diluted basis will ultimately translate into appreciation of our stock price 
during  our dbv per share appreciated by  driven by million in net income available to common shareholders  an overall improvement in valuations for our afs securities as financial markets improved and the execution of common share repurchases at a discount to book value 
the previously described impact of catastrophe loss on our net income available to common shareholders was the primary driver of the reduction in our dbv per share for the fiscal year 
cash dividends per common share we believe in returning excess capital to our shareholders by way of dividends as well as stock repurchases and  accordingly  our dividend policy is an integral part of the value we create for our shareholders 
our cumulatively strong earnings have permitted our board of directors to approve eight successive annual increases in quarterly common share dividends
