item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations references to a note are to the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
table of contents company overview as discussed in item business  the company operates primarily in two industry groups  hvac and construction products 
within each of these two industry groups  the company has identified two reportable segments the heating and cooling segment and the evaporative cooling segment in the hvac industry group and the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment and the door segment in the construction products industry group 
the heating and cooling segment produces and sells gas fired wall furnaces  console heaters and fan coils from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  wfc of colton  california 
the evaporative cooling segment produces and sells evaporative coolers from the company s wholly owned subsidiary  pmi of phoenix  arizona 
sales of these two segments are nationwide  but are concentrated in the southwestern united states 
concrete  aggregates and construction supplies are offered from numerous locations along the southern front range of colorado operated by the company s wholly owned subsidiaries collectively referred to as tmc 
the company sold its concrete operations in the denver market  rmrm on july  the operations of rmrm are reported as discontinued operations for both of the reported years 
doors are fabricated and sold along with the related hardware from colorado springs and pueblo through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  mdhi of pueblo  colorado 
sales of these two segments are highly concentrated in the front range area in colorado although door sales are also made throughout the united states 
sales of all four segments are affected by the level of construction activity in the areas served and general economic conditions  however  sales of furnaces and evaporative coolers are less affected by the level of construction activity as a large portion of their sales are for replacement units 
weather conditions in the areas served also affect sales 
sales in all four segments were affected by these factors in both and in addition to the above reporting segments  an unallocated corporate classification is used to report the unallocated expenses of the corporate office which provides treasury  insurance and tax services as well as strategic business planning and general management services 
expenses related to the corporate information technology group are allocated to all locations  including the corporate office 
an other classification is used to report a real estate operation and the activity of a new business venture  williams ecologix  inc this corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of wfc  entered into an agreement to distribute a product currently being developed by a third party 
should the product be successfully developed such that it results in a commercially salable product  the company is likely to incur start up costs and expenses above the current amount associated with the subsidiary s sole employee and miscellaneous related expenses 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash used in operations during was  despite a net loss of  the net loss  a net increase in working capital of  including the purchase for  of real property held for resale and the non cash nature of the deferred tax credit was largely offset by non cash depreciation and amortization charges of cash provided from operations in was  despite a net loss of  the positive cash flow in is reflective of depreciation and amortization charges of  and the recovery of  of prior years federal income taxes resulting from the carryback of the company s net operating loss 
partially offsetting the positive effects of depreciation and amortization charges and the tax refund was an increase in accounts receivable of  due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the comparable quarter 
investing activities during used cash of  compared to the use of  of cash during the company continued to limit capital expenditures during as sales volume remains depressed  however  expenditures for totaled  compared to  in capital expenditures during were primarily for the cacs segment and included  for development  permitting and equipment in preparation for mining the next phase of the pueblo aggregate deposit 
an additional  was spent for the buyout of three leased mixer trucks and the upgrade of a dozer 
the remaining expenditures were primarily for routine replacement or refurbishing of equipment in all of the segments 
investing activities in used cash of  due to lower sales volume  the company limited capital expenditures during to  capital expenditures during included  for the buyout of three leased loaders in the cacs segment 
the remaining expenditures were primarily for routine replacement or refurbishing of equipment in all of the segments 
during  financing activities provided  as the company borrowed  against its revolving bank loan and reduced long term debt by  including  of scheduled principal repayments 
during the casualty insurance provider returned  of the cash deposit for self insured claims to the company 

table of contents during  financing activities used  to reduce long term debt by  including  of scheduled principal repayments  and pay  against the revolving bank loan 
budgeted capital spending for is approximately  projected depreciation  depletion and amortization are approximately  planned capital expenditures are spread across all four segments and primarily represent the replacement or major refurbishment of older equipment 
the company expects to fund the planned capital expenditures from operating cash flow or  on a temporary basis  funds available from the revolving credit facility 
sales of the company s hvac products are seasonal except for fan coils 
sales of furnaces  heaters and evaporative coolers are sensitive to weather conditions particularly during the peak selling season 
fan coil sales are  to a significant extent  dependent on commercial construction  particularly of hotels 
revenues in the cacs segment are primarily dependent on the level of construction activity along the front range in southern colorado 
the level of construction activity over the past three years has been depressed due to the economic downturn  tighter credit markets and large quantity of repossessed homes for sale 
this situation has prevailed throughout most of the united states 
price competition tends to intensify in this segment when demand is weak 
inclement weather during the winter months in southern colorado can result in significantly reduced sales in those months even under robust economic conditions 
sales for the door segment are not as seasonal nor are they much affected by weather conditions 
historically  the company has experienced operating losses during the first quarter except when the weather is mild and demand strong along the front range 
operating results typically improve in the second and third quarters reflecting more favorable weather conditions in southern colorado and the seasonal sales of the evaporative cooling segment 
fourth quarter results can vary based on weather conditions in colorado as well as in the principal markets for the company s heating equipment 
the company typically experiences operating cash flow deficits during the first half of the year reflecting operating results  the use of sales dating programs extended payment terms related to the evaporative cooling segment and payments of the prior year s accrued incentive bonuses and company profit sharing contributions  if any 
as a result  the company s borrowings against its revolving credit facility tend to peak during the second quarter and then decline over the remainder of the year 
revolving credit and term loan agreement on april   the company entered into a secured credit agreement credit agreement under which the bank lender initially provided a total credit facility of  consisting of a  revolving credit facility with credit availability reduced by letters of credit that may be issued by the lender on the company s behalf and a  term loan 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by the company s accounts receivable  inventories  machinery  equipment  vehicles  certain real estate and the common stock of all of the company s subsidiaries 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of eligible inventories 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based on a london interbank offer rate libor or prime rate based option 
the lender required the company to enter into an interest rate swap transaction to hedge the interest rate on  of term debt 
on may  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction for a specified notional amount initially  whereby the company pays a fixed rate of on the notional amount and receives a floating rate equivalent to the day libor rate but not less than 
since the inception of this agreement the day libor rate has remained below 
hence  the effect of the transaction has been to increase the company s effective interest rate on  of its outstanding term debt by 
the notional amount was decreased by  on september  and  on december  such that the notional amount at december  was  the notional amount is further reduced by  on march  and the interest rate swap transaction terminates on april  the credit agreement has been amended five times amendments since its inception 
the credit agreement and its amendments either limit or require prior approval by the lender of additional borrowings  acquisition of stock of other companies  purchase of treasury shares and payment of cash dividends 
payment of accrued interest is due monthly or at the end of the applicable libor period on both the revolving credit borrowings and the term debt borrowings 
principal payments under the term loan are due quarterly with a final payment of all remaining unpaid principal at the maturity date 
the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the restated agreement effective november  in order to obtain a waiver of the covenant requiring a fixed charge coverage ratio of to as of october   to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement  to increase the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility and to modify certain other amounts  terms and conditions 
the restated agreement provides for the following the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement of to was waived for the twelve month period ended october  the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to will commence with the computation period ending march  the company must maintain a minimum tangible net worth as of the last day of any computation period of  plus of the consolidated net income for the immediately preceding fiscal year 

table of contents annual capital expenditures may not exceed  excluding those of williams ecologix  inc the balance sheet leverage ratio as of the last day of any computation period may not exceed to 
the maximum revolving credit facility line is increased to inventory borrowings are limited to a maximum of  the maturity date of the credit facility is extended to may  interest rate pricing for the revolving credit facility is libor plus or the prime rate plus 
the interest on the term loan is libor plus or the prime rate plus 
the term loan principal repayment schedule has been revised and reduced 
the table in note reflects the new maturities under the restated agreement 
as previously reported  wfc has entered into an agreement to distribute a product currently being developed by a third party 
should the product be successfully developed such that it results in a commercially salable product  wfc through a newly formed subsidiary  williams ecologix  inc is likely to incur start up costs and other expenses prior to the realization of revenues by this new business venture 
the permitted maximum cumulative cash expenditures for this venture are  commencing on march  definitions under the credit agreement as amended are as follows tangible net worth is defined as net worth plus subordinated debt  minus intangible assets goodwill  intellectual property  prepaid expenses  deposits and deferred charges  minus all obligations owed to the company or any of its subsidiaries by any affiliate or any or its subsidiaries and minus all loans owed by its officers  stockholders  subsidiaries or employees 
there are no loans owed by any of the referenced parties at october  or as of the date of this filing except for a loan of  to an officer of one of the company s subsidiaries made during the first quarter of fiscal in conjunction with his relocation as discussed in note adjusted ebitda is defined as net income  excluding the operating results of discontinued operations  plus interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization plus other non cash charges approved by the lender 
fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as  for any computation period  the ratio of a the sum for such period of adjusted ebitda minus the sum of income taxes paid in cash and b all unfinanced capital expenditures to the sum for such period of interest expense plus the required payments of principal of the term debt 
balance sheet leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of total debt to tangible net worth 
outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  were  the highest balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during was  average outstanding revolving credit during the year was  the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding revolving credit and term debt in and were and  respectively  including the effect of the interest rate swap discussed above 
at all times since the inception of the credit agreement  the company has had sufficient qualifying and eligible assets such that the available borrowing capacity exceeded the cash needs of the company and this situation is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the company has prepared a projection of cash sources and uses for the next months 
under this projection  adjusted for the actual results of the first two months of  the company believes that its existing cash balance  anticipated cash flow from operations and borrowings available under the credit agreement  will be sufficient to cover expected cash needs  including servicing debt and planned capital expenditures  for the next twelve months 
the company also expects to be in compliance with all debt covenants  as amended  during this period 
in april the company deposited cash of  with its casualty insurance carrier to serve as collateral for the self insured obligations under the company s casualty insurance program 
this deposit was funded with borrowings under the revolving credit line 
previously these obligations were secured by a bank letter of credit 
in april  the insurance carrier reduced its collateral requirement and returned  to the company 
the remaining balance at december  of  is classified as a current asset as the company received a full refund of the cash in march when a letter of credit was issued to the insurance company for the same amount 
reconciliation of fair value of reporting units to market capitalization the company estimates that the aggregate fair value of its four reporting units as of december  is approximately  the fair value of the cacs reporting unit was determined as described in the critical accounting policies discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets below 
the fair value of all other reporting units was estimated by management based on a discounted cash flow valuation using a discount rate in all cases 
after deducting all outstanding funded debt net of the cash deposit for self insured claims the calculation yields a net fair value of the equity of the reporting units of  the company s market capitalization as of december  was approximately  based on a december  share price of and  common shares outstanding 
it is the company s opinion that its share price reflects the negative impact of its corporate office expenses as many of these would not be required to operate the individual companies 
it is also the company s 
table of contents opinion that the value of its operating businesses is not diminished as a result of the corporate expenses 
therefore  in the company s opinion  in reconciling the fair value of the operating units to the market capitalization an adjustment to the market capitalization for the corporate expenses is appropriate 
using the five year average corporate office expenses after the related income tax benefit and applying a capitalization rate results in an adjusted market capitalization of  as of december  in the company s opinion  the difference between the net fair value of the reporting units and the adjusted market capitalization represents the value of the control premium 
as of december  the control premium is approximately of the adjusted market capitalization 
the company believes this level of control premium is reasonable and falls within a range based upon actual control premiums involving merger transactions of companies in the sic codes under which we operate 
a reconciliation of the fair value of the reporting units to the adjusted market capitalization is shown in the table below 
amounts are in thousands except share data 
market capitalization market capitalization based on based on the highest december  year to date closing price closing price of per share per share estimated fair value of reporting units less outstanding funded debt as of and add cash deposit for self insured claims net fair value of reporting units market capitalization  and  common shares outstanding adjustment for corporate expenses after income tax effect adjusted market capitalization control premium fair value of reporting units as determined above control premium as a percentage of adjusted market capitalization the lowest closing price of the company s common stock since december  was 
based on the closing price of january  this same computation yields a control premium of 
the cash deposit for self insured claims was replaced with a letter of credit on march  a significant portion of the company s common stock is closely held 
at december   the two largest shareholders and other officers and directors together own approximately of the outstanding shares 
the remaining shares available float represent only of the outstanding shares 
generally  there is limited trading activity in the company s shares 
on some trading days there is no trading activity 
the company s share price is subject to sharp volatility on trades of a few hundred shares or less 
for these reasons  it is the opinion of the company that its market capitalization at any given time is not indicative of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units 
insurance policies the company maintained insurance policies since march  with the following per incident deductibles and policy limits per occurrence policy aggregate deductible limits limits product liability general liability workers compensation statutory auto and truck liability no limit should the aggregate out of pocket payments related to the above policies exceed  during a policy year  deductibles on future claims are waived and the policies pay all amounts up to the policy limits 
should any  or all policy limits be exceeded  the company maintains an umbrella policy which covers the next  of claims 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements that are likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 

table of contents results of operations in the ensuing discussions of the results of operations we define the term gross profit as the amount determined by deducting cost of sales before depreciation  depletion and amortization from sales 
the gross profit ratio is gross profit divided by sales 
discussion of consolidated results from continuing operations vs 
consolidated sales in were  a decrease of compared to the lower sales are primarily attributable to the depressed market conditions in the concrete  aggregates and construction supplies cacs segment 
a low level of construction activity resulted in reduced concrete and aggregate shipments 
competitive pricing pressure also contributed to the diminished sales in this segment 
sales in this segment were down by compared to the prior year 
sales in the heating and cooling segment were lower in compared to the prior year 
a drop in fan coil sales  also reflecting the slow construction market  was partially offset by stronger furnace sales 
sales in the evaporative cooling segment were higher in the current year 
door sales were modestly lower in compared to the consolidated gross profit ratio in was compared to for the principal reasons for the lower gross profit ratio was the lower sales volume and concrete pricing in the cacs segment 
the gross profit ratios for the other three business segments were either higher or nearly the same as the prior year 
consolidated selling and administrative expenses were  
higher in expenses associated with the litigation related to the insurance claim concerning landslides at the pikeview quarry were  higher in compared to the prior year 
selling and administrative expenses in also included  related to the newly formed subsidiary  williams ecologix  inc excluding the pikeview litigation and the expenses of the new company  selling and administrative expenses were reduced by  as a percentage of consolidated sales  all selling and administrative expenses were compared to in the prior year 
excluding the pikeview litigation and the expenses of the new company these percentages were in and in the operating loss in was  compared to an operating profit of  in the prior year reflecting the diminished sales and gross profits of the cacs segment and the additional selling and administrative expenses 
net interest expense exclusive of amortization of deferred financing costs in was  compared to  in in the weighted average interest rate on outstanding funded debt  including the effect of an interest rate swap  was approximately compared to in average outstanding funded debt in was  compared to  in the reduction in outstanding indebtedness principally reflects the scheduled repayments of term debt over the last two years 
the company s effective income tax rate reflects federal and state statutory income tax rates adjusted for non deductible expenses  tax credits and other tax items 
the effective income tax rate related to the loss from continuing operations in was a benefit of compared to a benefit of related to the loss from continuing operations 
in november  the company filed a lawsuit against an insurance company with regard to a business interruption and property damage claim resulting from an incident that lead to the cessation of operations at the pikeview quarry in december of on february  the company filed a motion for partial summary judgment 
the litigation is still in the discovery process 
no recovery has been anticipated or recorded in the company s financial statements 
the company operates four businesses in two industry groups 
the businesses are seasonal  weather sensitive and subject to cyclical factors 
the following addresses various aspects of operating performance focusing on the reportable segments within each of the two industry groups 
construction products industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the construction products industry group for the fiscal years and amounts in thousands 

table of contents concrete  aggregates and construction supplies door revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating loss income operating loss income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets concrete  aggregates and construction supplies segment vs 
sales in the cacs segment fell by  due to the continuing weak construction market 
many of the jobs serviced in were publicly financed construction projects 
housing starts in the served market area remained at a depressed level 
ready mix concrete volume in was less in compared to the average price of ready mix concrete fell by reflecting a more intense level of competition in the slow market 
higher diesel fuel prices added approximately to the per yard delivery costs in compared to the prior year 
the gross profit per cubic yard declined by due to the reduced volume  lower ready mix prices and higher fuel costs 
sales of aggregates sand  crushed limestone and gravel  including internal consumption  were down compared to though both years were ones of very low volume 
the combined gross profit from all aggregate operations in was  compared to a gross profit of  in selling and administrative expenses increased by  however  this included the increase of  in litigation expenses related to the pikeview insurance claim 
otherwise  selling and administrative expenses in this segment were reduced by  the prices of two commodities  cement and diesel fuel  can have a significant effect on the results of operations of this segment 
the company negotiates cement prices with producers who have production facilities in or near the concrete markets that we serve 
the company may negotiate separate cement prices for large construction projects depending on the demand for and availability of cement from the local producers 
the company buys diesel fuel from local distributors 
it may from time to time enter into a short term arrangement with a distributor whereby the price of diesel fuel is fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company does not otherwise hedge diesel fuel prices 
changes in the cost of these two commodities have a direct effect on the results of operations depending upon whether competitive conditions prevailing in the marketplace enable the company to adjust its selling prices to recover the increased costs 
door segment vs 
door sales in were  less than the previous year 
the decline in sales here is also related to the weak construction market particularly within the state of colorado 
a more competitive bidding environment resulted in a decrease in the gross profit ratio to in from in the door segment sales backlog at the end of was approximately  compared to approximately  at the end of hvac industry group the table below presents a summary of operating information for the two reportable segments within the hvac industry group for the fiscal years and amounts in thousands 

table of contents heating and cooling evaporative cooling revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets revenues from external customers segment gross profit gross profit as percent of sales segment operating income operating income as a percent of sales segment assets return on assets heating and cooling segment vs 
sales in the heating and cooling segment decreased by  compared to sales of fan coils dropped by due to a slow commercial construction market particularly hotel construction 
in addition  a focus on improving profit margins on fan coils resulted in the company not bidding some jobs where the projected profit margin was not acceptable 
sales of furnaces and heaters were higher in the higher level of sales for these products was due in part to some rehabilitation projects at multifamily dwellings 
the segment s gross profit ratio improved from in to in due to improved factory productivity  product sales mix and better purchasing methods which resulted in reductions in some material costs 
selling and administrative expenses in were approximately  lower than in the previous year 
reduced marketing and sales expenses related to the fan coil product line and lower legal fees were the two principal contributors to the lower selling and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of sales such expenses were in compared to in evaporative cooling segment vs 
sales of evaporative coolers increased by approximately in compared to the prior year 
sales in the early part of were adversely affected by a carryover of inventory at some customers from the season 
selling prices were also increased in to offset higher steel costs and increases in other materials prices 
the gross profit ratio in was compared to in the improvement in the gross profit ratio was the result of the higher production volume and a beneficial change in product sales mix 
selling and administrative expenses were approximately  higher in due to higher selling expenses that typically accompany increased sales volume  additional sales staff and increased incentive compensation 
as a percentage of sales these expenses were and in and  respectively 
both businesses in the hvac group are sensitive to changes in prices for a number of different raw materials  commodities and purchased parts 
prices of steel and copper in particular can have a significant effect on the results of operations of this group 
we are not currently a party to any hedging arrangements with regard to copper or steel 
outlook overall the company expects sales in to be just modestly higher compared to based on our backlogs and bidding activity we believe the construction market along the front range in southern colorado will exhibit some  though small  improvement for the year as a whole 
however  compared to prior more robust periods  we expect our sales volume will remain at a very low level 
the company believes that price competition will remain sharp in the cacs segment 
fuel prices are likely to be higher  on average  in compared to local cement suppliers have announced price increases 
in order to prevent our profit margins from deteriorating further  we plan on increasing the prices we charge for ready mix concrete in the second quarter of however  in we were generally unable to obtain higher concrete prices due to sharply competitive bidding for the modest amount of work that was available 
the company continues to work on a mining and reclamation plan to reopen the pikeview quarry 
the plan requires the approval of the department of natural resources of the state of colorado 
if such approval is obtained  and there is no assurance 
table of contents that it will be obtained  the company anticipates that it will be able to resume operations at the pikeview quarry 
we estimate that an additional  to  of capital spending will be required to recommence operations at pikeview 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the litigation with regard to the pikeview quarry insurance claim 
the company s hvac industry group anticipates some but not a significant increase in sales in we expect the fan coil market to improve from its current slow pace 
sales of furnaces  heaters and evaporative coolers are primarily for replacement purposes and therefore are not reliant on new construction 
sales of these products are generally dependent on the overall strength of the economy especially employment levels 
sales of furnaces heaters and evaporative coolers are also significantly influenced by weather conditions particularly during the usual selling season 
overall capital spending in is expected to be approximately critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission requires all registrants  including the company  to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies and methods 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually assesses goodwill for potential impairment as of the last day of its fiscal year 
in addition  to the extent that events occur  either involving the relevant reporting unit or in their industries  the company revisits its assessment of the recorded goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred and should be recognized 
as of december   the company has recorded  of goodwill consisting of  related to the cacs reporting unit and  related to the door reporting unit 
the company early adopted accounting standards update asu which allows an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the company concluded that market conditions affecting the cacs reporting unit had sufficiently changed such that the quantitative analysis was more appropriate than the qualitative analysis in this instance 
for purposes of measuring the fair value of the cacs reporting unit the company engages the services of an independent investment banking firm to assist management with the calculation 
the fair value of this reporting unit is determined by applying three valuation methods 
these are discounted cash flow dcf valuation  an analysis of comparable transactions within the industry and comparable enterprise valuations of other public companies in the industry 
the dcf valuation involves projecting future cash flows 
the cash flow projection entails key assumptions with regard to unit sales volumes  gross profit rate per unit or per sales dollar  capital expenditures and the discount rate 
these assumptions were provided by management or discussed with the investment banking firm and agreed upon prior to use in the dcf calculation 
the cash flow projection assumes a gradual recovery in construction activity along the front range in southern colorado  the reporting unit s principal market area 
however  projected unit volumes do not reach levels achieved in this reporting unit during the peak of the previous business cycle 
the projections assume that the company will resume operations at the pikeview quarry or will be able to increase production at its other aggregate operations 
the cash flow projections assume some increase in gross profit rates compared to current levels due to an increase in volume  an improvement in the relationship of selling prices for concrete relative to cement unit costs and some cost reductions 
the projected gross profit rates do not exceed levels previously attained 
projected capital expenditures are compatible with the projected unit sales volume 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by a discount rate that takes into consideration both the time value of money and the investment risk 
the valuation of the cacs segment  assuming discount rates ranging between and  approximates million to million 
the independent investment banking firm was instrumental to management in researching transactions within the industry that were consummated during  concluding that there were very few such transactions that could be viewed as comparable to the cacs segment 
currently  as a result of rapidly deteriorating ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization within the construction materials industry  many industry analysts are now applying multiples of mid cycle or average ebitda in valuing transactions 
the cacs segment s year average ebitda mid cycle is million 
while historic ebitda multiples suggest that the year average is times ebitda  the industry multiple more often seen applied to mid cycle ebitda is times to times 
when applying this ebitda multiple to the cacs mid cycle ebitda  the calculated value is between million to million 
six other publicly traded companies were identified for purposes of the comparable enterprise valuation 
since the cacs reporting unit had negative ebitda in fiscal  the comparable enterprise valuation was based on projected ebitda 
the average projected ebitda multiple was and the median ebitda multiple was the comparison of public companies methodology results in a valuation of the cacs reporting unit of million to million when applying the projected ebitda of that reporting unit 
the fair value of the door reporting unit is estimated by the company based on its own discounted cash flow dcf projection 
the cash flow projection involves key assumptions regarding sales  costs  expenses and capital expenditures 
management believes that 
table of contents the projections are reasonable and the projected cash flows approximate prior experience 
the discount rate used to determine the dcf valuation as of december  was 
the estimated fair value based on the discounted cash flow projection indicates a fair value for the reporting unit that exceeds the carrying value of the net assets in the reporting unit by 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the estimated fair values are reasonable  however  a prolonged period of depressed construction activity along the front range in southern colorado  inability to resume production at the pikeview quarry  inability to increase production at the company s other aggregate operations or changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unpredictable future events or circumstances could materially affect the estimated fair value 
long lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets by asset group for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions  including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset  the amount and useful life over which cash flows will occur and the asset s residual value  if any 
in turn  measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value  which is based on the best information available given the company s historical experience and internal business plans 
the company has determined that there was no impairment of such long lived assets in liabilities the company purchases insurance coverage for workers compensation  general product and automobile liability  retaining certain levels of risk self insured portion 
see the above section titled insurance policies for information related to per incident deductibles and policy limits 
provision for workers compensation claims is estimated by management based on information provided by the independent third party administrator and periodic review of all outstanding claims 
the company s independent claims administrator tracks all claims and assigns a liability to each individual claim based upon facts known at the time of estimation 
in addition  management periodically reviews each individual claim with both the third party claims administrator and legal counsel and the third party administrator revises the estimated liability accordingly 
the company also retains an independent expert who applies actuarial methodology to the claims data provided by the company s independent claims administrator to estimate the ultimate aggregate settlement amount of the claims using specific loss development factors based on the company s prior experience 
the company then establishes its reserve for workers compensation claims based upon the actuarial evaluation and management s knowledge of the outstanding claims 
management tracks changes to the incurred and paid amounts of individual workers compensation claims up to the date of final closure 
in recent years  the net amounts that the claims have ultimately settled for have indicated that the reserve recorded by the company has been sufficient 
with regard to product liability  provisions for both claims and unasserted claims that would be covered under the self insured portion of the policies are reviewed at least annually and are recorded in accordance with accounting guidance on contingent liabilities provided in the fasb accounting standards codification codification 
management also incorporates information from discussions with legal counsel handling the individual claims when revising its estimates 
provision for automobile claims is estimated based upon information provided by the company s independent claims administrator and the company s own experience 
the number of automobile claims and the amounts involved are not material 
historically  there have not been many instances of significant variances between actual final settlements and our estimates regarding automobile and product liability claims 
the company maintains a reserve for future reclamation work to be performed at its various aggregate operations based upon an estimate of the total expense that will be incurred to reclaim the disturbed areas 
actual reclamation costs are charged to expense 
the adequacy of the recorded reserve is assessed annually 
the assessment may be done more frequently if events or circumstances arise that may indicate a change in estimated costs  recoverable material or the period of mining activity 
for the annual assessment of the reserve  company engages an independent professional to assist in reevaluating the estimates of both the quantities of recoverable material and the cost of reclamation 
our assessment of the adequacy of the reclamation reserves is based on management s assumptions with the assistance of the independent professional 
the analysis requires the use of significant assumptions and estimates about the mining plans  homogeneity of the deposits  third party costs to perform work  method of reclamation to be used  etc 
management believes that the assumptions and estimates used to determine the reserve are reasonable  however  changes in the aforementioned assumptions and estimates  as well as the effects of unknown future events or circumstances  including legislative requirements  could materially affect estimated costs  the quantities of recoverable material or the period of mining 
depletion of rock and sand deposits and amortization of deferred development costs are computed by the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable quantities of rock and sand 

table of contents sales the company recognizes revenue as products are shipped to customers 
sales are recorded net of estimates of applicable provisions for discounts  volume incentives  returns and allowances based upon current program terms and historical experience 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debt and warranty expense as well as an amount anticipated to be granted to customers under cooperative advertising programs based upon current program terms and historical experience 
additionally  the hvac companies offer discounts for early payment of amounts due under dating and other extended payment programs 
the company records reserves for these items based upon historical experience 
guidance provided by the codification that cash consideration including sales incentives given by a vendor to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services unless both of the following conditions are met a the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in exchange for the consideration and b the vendor can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit 
under this guidance  volume incentives and customer discounts provided to our customers are presumed to be a reduction in the selling price of our products and accordingly we record these as a reduction of gross sales 
we require that our customers submit proof of both the advertisement and the cost of the advertising expenditure before we allow a deduction for cooperative advertising
