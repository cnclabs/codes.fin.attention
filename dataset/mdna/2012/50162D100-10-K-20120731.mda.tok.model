company overview we produce  process  and sell coal in the people s republic of china china or prc and also have a financial interest in the bowie mine  a us thermal coal mine located in paonia  colorado 
as of april  our vertically integrated coal operations include four coal mines  three coal washing plans  one coking facility  and a coal wholesale and distribution network in the southwest region of china 
as of april  the results of our annual coal operations are as follows coal mining approximately  tons  coal washing approximately  tons  coal whole sale approximately  tons and coking approximately  tons 
currently  substantially all of our coal mining operations are located in the guizhou and yunnan provinces 
our operations are located in inland and rural areas of china  which are being developed at a faster rate than the coastal areas that have historically received most of the prc s government focus 
we sell the coal we produce  or acquire through wholesalers  both though direct sales to end users in china and through other wholesalers 
we were initially founded in by an american citizen and current chairman and ceo dickson lee and originally focused on consulting services 
in we become a public reporting company and in acquired a majority interest in a coal related air compressor equipment company lek located in china  which interest we disposed on in in order to focus on growing our coal businesses 
in we commenced our coal operations which now constitute our principal operating business 
we have funded our business to date primarily through investments from our founder and chairman  from private placements  from cash flows from operations and from certain debt financings and arrangements 
we conduct our operations through both wholly owned subsidiaries  majority interests in other entities  and one investment in a us based mine 
as of april   we entered into several agreements with colorado based bowie resources  llc bowie and have loaned a total of about million to bowie 
the loan originally carried an interest rate of nine percent which has since increased to eleven percent 
the total owing to the company as of april   was  under such agreement and the loan and interest payment timetable is on schedule 
in addition to the loan  the company has secured exclusive rights to market coal from bowie to china  taiwan  japan  and korea details of operation are still being finalized 
bowie has been mining coal since and recently resumed its longwall production 
it produces high quality super compliance thermal coal with high btu  low sulfur  and low ash 
the company is also exploring ports for both import and export  including zhangjiang port in guangdong province  china 
we derive our revenues from selling coal to customers  mainly state owned enterprises soe in yunnan and guizhou provinces 
our thermal or steam coal is sold to soes that are utilities that generate power  mainly electricity 
our metallurgical coal and coking coal is sold to soes that make steel  though some steelmaker customers also purchase thermal coal to generate power for the steel factory 
we are a united states company incorporated in nevada and headquartered in seattle  wa and have a china operations centers in kunming city in yunnan province and in guiyang in guizhou province 
the majority of our management team and board of directors are american citizens  including three of four officers  and many are bilingual 
after being a public reporting company since  we commenced trading on the nasdaq global market in february macroeconomic factors there were several relevant macro economic factors directly impacting our operating environment in china during fy  including gdp growth and inflation 
last year  china s economy expanded  down from the previous year 
this was largely attributable to a turbulent world economic climate and china s efforts to tame inflation 
china s gdp growth fell to percent in the first quarter of after an percent gain in the fourth quarter of the consensus view among economists is that china will see growth of percent for calendar while china s premier wen jiabao has lowered expectations to 
at the start of the company s fiscal year in may  inflation in china was  rising to a high of in july after the prc tightened their fiscal policies  which included letting interest rates rise and capping prices of certain domestically produced commodities like coal not to exceed last year s prices  inflation fell to at the end of the company s fiscal year in april as a result  china began our fiscal year with higher demand for coal to fuel gdp growth but coal shortages due to the capping of coal prices and ended our fiscal year with slightly decreasing demand froma slowing national economy and an oversupply of coal from a flood of cheaper imported coal 
the coal shortages in were exacerbated by floods in australia and inclement weather in indonesia  both temporarily decreasing coal production in countries that export coal to china 
this resulted in temporarily benefiting us producers until australian mines got back into production 
indonesia normally experiences heavy rainfall during their rainy season but has seen relatively light rains this year  resulting in increasing the supply of export coal because of higher coal production 
coal prices in the united states have declined because there is lower demand for coal due to unseasonably adverse weather conditions  a large surplus inventory of coal  the current administration s anti coal policies  and increased competition from natural gas 
therefore us coal prices have declined 
combined with a sluggish market for coal in europe due to slow economic growth  coal exporters have taken advantage of the arbitrage opportunities between chinese domestic coal prices and international coal prices 
this has created a temporary oversupply of coal  filling the storage capacity in chinese ports and chinese coal fired electrical power plants have reported record inventories of coal 
however  while the coastal metropolises have great demand for coal  growth is slowing in these large cities 
but growth  and therefore demand  is still high in the secondary cities in non coastal china like kunming in yunnan province and guiyang in guizhou province  both where we operate 
china has a relatively underdeveloped rail system of which the government has chosen to put a higher emphasis on developing passenger rail over freight rail 
therefore  the coal fired electrical power plants in coastal cities have huge stockpiles of coal and the excess coal that is crowding port storage facilities sits there because the rail system is inadequate to transport the coal to non coastal cities that need it 
also because of the lack of supply of freight rail  it is costly and mostly negates the price advantage of cheap imported coal 
coal will continue to be a key component of the prc s energy policy 
according to the us energy information administration  coal makes up of china s total primary energy consumption and china is both the largest consumer and producer of coal in the world 
in  china accounted for over of the world s coal consumption 
it is estimated that demand for coal in china will continue to increase for several decades  thus producing a favorable business environment for coal producers and wholesalers 
although china has substantial natural coal resources  the coal mining industry in china is fragmented and inefficient  and includes many small companies who lack the economies of scale and resources needed to maximize production capacity 
historically  mining companies in china have been unable to produce enough coal to meet china s growing coal demands 
as a result the prc has allowed china to become a net importer of coal and has implemented a national policy of consolidation to increase production capacity  improve efficiency and safety in coal mines in china 
beginning with the th year plan  the policy of government mandated consolidation has continued with the current th year plan  which expands and accelerates the consolidation to new provinces including guizhou 
the twelfth five year plan impact on the chinese coal industry the national people s congress ratified the th five year plan in march for the period three sectors received a major boost health care  technology  and energy 
with its emphasis on inclusive growth  the chinese government is encouraging foreign business participation in these strategic emerging industries 
in the energy sector  the prc announced guidelines for a government mandated consolidation of the fragmented and inefficient coal industry in guizhou province  similar to earlier consolidation efforts in northern china 
on april   the general office of the government of guizhou province issued document number notifying the guizhou province energy department of guidelines related to accelerating the pace of consolidation through there are three main components to the guidelines production  safety  and efficiency 
first  in addition to increasing individual mine production  the provincial government is mandating that individual mines be consolidated into coal holding companies responsible for a minimum production between  and  tons per year  thus reducing the number of coal holding companies to or less 
second  safety standards will continue to rise as well as increased safety enforcement activity 
for example  a mine accident in a county will now result in a temporary shutdown of all mines operating in that county so that safety inspectors can review the safety of each mine 
third  to improve efficiency  the level of mechanization will increase significantly  both in shaft drilling and coal production 
soon after the distribution of guizhou province s policy  liupanshui city government  which is the local government of pan county where our weishe and daping mines operate  issued their implementation policy 
we also anticipate and are prepared for the consolidation policy to eventually be implemented and accelerated in yunnan province 
as a result of increasing individual mine production standards and the accelerating consolidation policy  our coal operations have grown significantly in the last five years  primarily through acquisitions  and more recently from expanding production capacity at existing mines 
general discussion and analysis of fy results we began our first quarter in fy with declining production compared with the strong results from fy  where we more than doubled our fy revenue 
starting with the end of the fourth quarter of fy  we experienced normal seasonal decreases in coal prices from the warming spring weather and what appeared to be temporary government mandated idling of some of our mines due to nearby fatal accidents in non llen mines 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fy  there were fatal mining accidents in yunnan province and fatal mining accidents in pan county of guizhou province 
and while there were no fatal accidents at any of our mines  because the new guizhou consolidation policy had a greater emphasis on increasing safety standards for coal mines and increasing safety enforcement  the government began slowing down or idling all nearby mines until each mine passed a new safety inspection  including the company s 
further  due to the consolidation policy being new  the policies  processes  and regulations were still being developed by the government  which added uncertainty and lack of visibility to how long mines would be idled or production slowed down 
these area wide slowdowns and idling also reduced the supplies of raw coal needed for our coal washing  coal wholesale and distribution  and coking segments  resulting in reduced revenues for some months during the quarter 
however  through better sourcing  the company was able to secure a steady supply of raw coal needed to sustain the consistent quarterly production in our coking and washing segments 
in the month of june  dapuan and sutsong started ramping up production and daping proceeded to expand its production capacity but ping yi remained idled 
overall  our q fy results were approximately one third less than q fy  but we began to see some recovery in our mining and washing segments toward the end of the quarter as the government allowed for some production in our mines and neighboring mines 
also during the first quarter of fy  ed moy  vice president of corporate infrastructure was elected an officer of the company in may 
the company hosted its first investor day in new york city in may  featuring the honorable norm mineta  vice chairman of the board and former secretary of commerce appointed by president bill clinton and former secretary of transportation appointed by president george w 
bush 
also in may  the company established our second coal wholesale and distribution subsidiary yunnan l l tai fung co  ltd 
and transferred hong xing from tni to tai fung 
in june  the company appointed ian robinson to become the chief financial officer 
mr 
robinson was a former partner at ernst young and remains a director of the company 
the company also elected dr 
syd peng as a director of the company 
dr 
peng is a renowned coal mining expert and a professor of the department of mine engineering at the west virginia university and previously served as chair of the department 
the second quarter of fy started with improvement in the performance of our mining and washing segments because of fewer intermittent slowdowns and idling of our mines and neighboring mines 
dapuan and sutsong mines produced at a steady pace though less than fy production levels 
daping produced  tons from the successful test run in august of their increased capacity and ping yi produced a respectable  tons from the successful test run in august before being idled in september as a result of government mandated idling of area mines after a major fatal accident mid august just miles from ping yi mine 
while q fy coal mining revenues were down approximately one third compared to q fy  they were equivalent to q fy when the government began their increased safety enforcement 
while our coal washing segment revenues were down approximately one third compared to q fy  it performed strongly in august  raising our quarterly results for our washing segment to nearly matching q fy and q fy our coking segment also had a production high in august  raising our quarterly results to exceed both q of fy and q of fy however  our wholesale and distribution segment continued to lag due to lack of raw coal supplies resulting from the government mandated slowdowns and idling of other area coal mines 
overall our q fy results were less than q fy but our revenues increased from the first quarter to the second quarter fy also during the second quarter of fy  board members robert okun and andrew leitch both decided not to stand for reelection and shareholders reelected the remaining directors at the annual general shareholders meeting in september 
throughout the quarter  the company received encouragement and support from the guizhou government including the guizhou vice governor  the guizhou energy bureau chief  and the pan county guizhou province government 
the company entered into a strategic partnership with tianjin fuhao  a large chinese logistics company 
the company also received signed letters of intent from operating coal mines in guizhou province that were willing to be acquired by the company subject to further due diligence and negotiations on the terms 
in september  the company received a letter of endorsement from the industrial and commercial bank of china indicating intent to provide debt financing for the company s consolidation efforts in guizhou  subject to due diligence on each acquisition 
the third quarter of fy started with a significant fatal accident in november in a non llen mine operating illegally near our dapuan mine  and dapuan and other area mines were subject to a government mandated idling or slowdown in production 
this major accident caused our mine s production to drop over half in q many small mine operators who are uncertain of their future under the guizhou accelerated consolidation and the yunnan consolidation  have tried to maximize their gain in the short term by pushing their production beyond their capacity while reducing expenditures for safety 
this has resulted in increasing the number of mining accidents  sometimes with high numbers of fatalities 
in turn  the provincial and local governments have responded by ordering temporary idling or slowdowns of mines in the region for safety inspections or safety briefings 
some choose to operate illegally during the idling or slowdown periods 
others when allowed to produce again push even harder to make up for lost production 
this behavior coupled with the complicated geology of the yunnan and guizhou regions contributes toward a higher risk for fatal mining accidents 
this cycle is consistent with the earlier consolidation in other provinces 
beginning in november  da ping progressed from idled to slowdown status  resulting in increasing production over half from q to q  which was the highest quarterly production since the company acquired the mine 
ping yi continued to be idled and produced a moderate amount of coal as a byproduct of expanding its production capacity during the idling 
in addition  the dismissal of some local government officials further complicated the resumption of normal production 
sutsong mine  which produced slightly less in q than in q due to frequent government mandated slowdowns due to nearby accidents 
by january  dapuan  sutsong  and daping mines were ramping up production to the capacity of our approved mining permit rather than near the capacity of our mining permit application to increase the specific number of tons of coal that can be extracted from our mines each year 
because of decreased supplies of raw coal and fine coal resulting from the government mandated temporary slowdowns and idling of coal mines in the regions we operate  wholesale revenues and coal washing revenues decreased by over half during q fy compared to q fy  while coal coking revenue decreased by more than a third during q fy compared to q fy therefore our net revenues for q fy decreased over half compared to q fy the decrease was primarily due to the government s temporary slowdown and idling of all mines in our region  including our mines  coupled with the chinese new year holiday  which this year  the majority fell in january instead of spread between january and february 
these factors reduced our sources and volume of coal available for our coal washing  coking  and wholesale and distribution segments and decreased our production in our mines 
second quarter to the third quarter revenues decreased almost a third from million to million 
the revenue decline was partially slowed because the shortage of coal in the regions we operate due to mine slowdowns and idling resulted in an increase in the price customers paid per ton of coal 
also during the third quarter of fy  the company established daxing l l coal co  ltd  a new coal wholesale and distribution operation in guizhou province in november 
the company announced in december two joint sales agreements  one with china chengtong metal corporation and the other with tianjin fuhao  to sell million tons each in calendar director robert lee resigned from the board and ed moy  vice president for corporate infrastructure and an officer of the company  was elected a director in december 
the company also announced in early january an mou to potentially acquire three mines in guizhou province  all under development by union energy 
at the beginning of february  the company acquired majority equity interest one of the mines covered by the mou  the weishe mine 
in the fourth quarter of fy  we began a promising recovery in our mining segment 
the total tons produced during q exceeded each of the four prior quarters 
dapuan mine passed the government safety inspection mid february was approved to begin ramping up production  and its q production neared its approved production license for  tons per year and sutsong mine s q production neared its approved production license for  tons per year 
both mines expansion of production capacity is on schedule 
daping mine s q production succeeded q as the highest production since we owned the mine 
ping yi mine continued to be idled with no clarity on when it would be approved for production  and as a result  the company sold it at the end of april back to the original owners 
our coal washing segment rebounded from a low q to average quarterly levels in q however our coal wholesale segment has performed consistently with the last three quarters  remaining low due to lack of coal supplies from decreased supplies of raw coal and fine coal resulting from the government mandated temporary slowdowns and idling of area mines 
our coking segment experienced a sharp downturn in q due to slow steel demand and resulting high stockpiles of coking coal and therefore production at our zonelin coking plant at the end of the quarter was minimal 
the company did execute our mou to acquire majority interest in the weishe mine  which is one of three mines being developed by union energy 
this marks a shift our acquisition strategy driven by the continued implementation of the guizhou consolidation policy 
until recently  the guizhou mines available to be acquired were small operating mines lacking the capital to expand to meet the production requirements of the consolidation policy 
because the mines were built for smaller capacity  they required considerable capital expenditures to expand production capacity  which the company used the mine s operating surplus to fund the capital expenditures capex 
however  larger mines designed with production capacity to surpass the maximum production requirements of the consolidation policy have recently become available for acquisition because the consolidation policy requires all mines to come under a holding company controlling between  and  tons 
weishe mine is designed to produce up to  tons when fully built out  and is phasing in production beginning at  tons the first year 
this is in contrast to sutsong mine  which was built to have a maximum capacity of  tons and needs significant capex to meet the minimum consolidation production requirement of  tons 
also during the fourth quarter of fy  the company continued the expansion of its coal wholesale and distribution business in guizhou by signing a strategic sales agreement with avic international coal logistics co  ltd  and through its daxing wholesale subsidiary signed two long term sales contracts providing coal to both guodian yongfu power generation co  ltd 
to datang international power generation co  ltd 
which the company delivered its first shipment in q fy to accommodate our growing guizhou wholesale business  the company secured a large coal storage and rail loading space in shinpingba in guizhou province 
also in april  former top executive from the largest coal company s in the world shenhua group corporation  jingcai yang was elected to the board 
finally  there have been a number of key events that have occurred subsequent to the company s fiscal year end april  that will be discussed in more detail in the q for q fy the company announced a discretionary stock buy back program in which up to million of shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market during appropriate trading periods when the return on investment of the company s capital invested in re purchased shares supersedes all other uses of that capital 
the company also entered into a mou to purchase the two other mines owned by union energy  namely louzhou and lashu mines 
both have been designed to meet the maximum anticipated production capacity mandated by the guizhou provincial government 
the acquisition of louzhou mine may include a swap of the da ping mine  the zonelin coking plant  and shares of the company for controlling interest in louzhou mine 
the acquisitions are dependent on further due diligence  final negotiation on the terms  and board approval 
in addition  weishe mine passed its final safety inspection in july and will receive its license for coal production 
plan of operations the company is a vertically integrated coal operator participating in the business of consolidation of a fragmented coal industry in yunnan and guizhou provinces of southwest china 
we plan to expand our coal business two ways first  through expansion of existing operations in accordance with the consolidation policy  and second  through continued acquisitions of operations that lack the capital and management skills to expand to meet the minimum capacity required by the government 
additional plans for operations for expanding our coal business includes expanding our coal wholesale operations into guizhou  pursuing strategic partnerships  exploring viable options for raising capital with an emphasis on debt and other non dilutive instruments  and strengthening our team 
organic growth 
we acquire producing mines that lack the capital and management expertise to expand to meet the minimum government mandated production requirement  and then we provide the management expertise and fund the needed capital expenditures for each acquisition to expand their production capacity and improve safety 
most coal mines in southwest china  including our mines  use the conventional traditional mining method  under which the coal seam is broken up by explosives and then the coal is gathered and loaded on to shuttle cars  which are winched to the surface loading area by a cable and rail system 
in lieu of shuttle cars  the company uses conveyer systems at both the da ping and weishe mines  which are much more efficient and safer than shuttle cars 
we also drill additional shafts in some of our mines to increase safety  operational efficiency  and improve the working environment 
while our mines continue to use timber to reinforce mine shafts  the company has improved safety by using steel and hydraulic braces to reinforce the support the roof of the mine 
we have also invested in monitoring equipment for hazardous gases like methane  better electrical equipment and communication systems  gps locators for each underground miner  and blowers and better ventilation systems to ensure safe air quality 
the company also seeks to acquire larger mines and mines designed to scale up to large production have come on the market recently because the consolidation policy requires that all mines come under a holding company that controls one to two million tons of production per year 
in addition to simple infrastructure improvements  we improve our production and safety by introducing basic management practices like increasing the working hours by expanding the operation from one shift to multiple shifts and work teams  and using production incentives and bonuses as part of our team s compensation package 
our mine operations have instituted regular safety training for our mine management and workers  regular sharing of safety information  and individual shift safety briefings and debriefings at the start and end of each shift 
because slogans are effective in impacting chinese behavior  safety banners are posted for easy viewing 
we comply with and try to exceed all the safety standards and cooperate fully with local  provincial  and national government safety regulators and safety supervision teams 
there have been no fatal accidents in any of our mines 
this has resulted in the successful integration and safe expansion of the five mines we have acquired  which include the four mines we currently operate  all of which are producing more than when we acquired them and are on their way to meeting the current  tons a year government mandated minimum annual production requirement 
for example  for the two mines which the company has owned the longest  and have had the most time to work on our expansion plans  dapuan mine s production increased from  tons in fy to  tons per year in fy and sutsong mine s production increased from  tons in fy to  tons in fy the value and revenue of some of our mined coal is increased by coal washing 
the company constructed the dapuan coal washing plant to enhance the value of the coal mined at dapuan mine 
in addition  the company expanded the capacity of our coal washing facilities  in particular hong xing and ping yi before its divesture  both of which washed other mines coal 
the divesture of ping yi coal washing includes prepaid coal washing services for the company  ensuring some washing capacity for the company s coal 
given the increasing frequency of the government ordered idling or slowdown of mines in the areas the company operates in  we have been fully compliant with provincial and local government authorities 
during these periods  the company continues to expand the capacity of our mines and improve the safety of our mines 
when approved for production  we have been producing to a capacity that avoids the risk of any accidents  generally to the capacity of our approved mining permit instead of near the capacity of our mining permit application to increase the specific number of tons of coal that can be extracted from our mines each year 
in the past  the government has allowed the company to produce more than the existing permit allows but less than the amount applied for in the application 
acquisition growth 
we believe that the current consolidation policy in china will continue and thus create more acquisition opportunities for us 
the company will also need to accelerate the rate of acquisitions and increasing consideration of acquiring larger mines and mines designed with larger production capacity in order to comply with the government mandated consolidation targets for holding companies 
our focus in the short term will be taking advantage of unique opportunities to acquire mines due to the accelerated government mandated consolidation policy in guizhou province 
the process includes negotiating and signing memorandums of understanding and letters of intent with mines that meet our criteria 
we seek two types of acquisitions 
our standard criteria include existing mines in production with good infrastructure and sufficient reserves but lacking the capital and management to expand to or beyond the current minimum of  tons per year or mines 
because the consolidation policy requires that all mines must also join a holding company that controls coal production between  tons and  tons  our criteria now include larger operating or mines that were designed for a  and larger capacity mines that need to join a holding company 
we then send in a team to inspect the mine  evaluate the management  and perform extensive due diligence 
based on the analysis of our inspection team  we target and negotiate to acquire the best mines 
thus far  our acquisition team has attained signed letters of intent with producing mines in guizhou province and will continue to evaluate and target further mines for acquisition 
we may not acquire all the mines that we have signed letters of intent for 
our inspection team  suggests strategies by dr 
syd peng  was in china at the end of our second fiscal quarter and the start of our fourth fiscal quarter to inspect  assess  and supervise the acquisitions 
dr 
peng and the inspection team have physically inspected a significant number of potential mines for acquisition and have recommended the company pursue the acquisition of several of mines 
our teams are currently focused on extensive due diligence of these potential acquisitions in preparation for upcoming negotiations 
in addition to mines that meet our preferred criteria  we have been inspecting larger mines with production near  tons or more  or mines designed with greater production capacity  and have considerable proven coal reserves  better geology  and strong management teams already in place 
when these well designed mines are executed effectively  they require less capital expenditure to expand capacity 
strong management teams are integral to better safety and allow for scaling up operations more quickly 
mines with these characteristics are on the market more frequently than in the past because the government implementation of the guizhou consolidation plan announced in the spring of has started to change the local market 
the company will put a higher priority on larger mines while continuing to explore existing mines that meet our preferred criteria 
as a result  the company recently entered into a relationship with union energy who is developing three mines  each designed with  tons of production capacity each 
we have acquired the weishe mine and may acquire the remaining two mines pending further due diligence  final negotiations on the terms  and board approval 
other 
in addition to acquiring mines  the company established a new coal wholesale operation daxing l l coal company 
with approval from the government  daxing has begun developing additional coal storage space and growing its distribution network 
our subsidiary is expected to generate revenue in and through its sourcing of coal  introduce potential mine acquisitions to the company in a similar manner as kmc 
daxing recently entered into a joint sales agreement with two strategic partners 
the first is china chengtong metal tianjin company  a wholly owned subsidiary of ccmc  a large china state owned enterprise specializing in coal and metal trading throughout northern china and inner mongolia 
the second is tianjin fuhao industrial co 
ltd 
both companies agree to source and sell up to one million tons of coal each with the company in calendar in addition  the company is also exploring strategic partnerships that can accelerate our ability to grow organically and acquisitively and has signed a memorandum of understanding with tianjin fuhao industrial co 
ltd to explore strategic opportunities to expand and enhance the value of both companies 
tianjin fuhao is a major coal wholesaler and logistics company in northern china and is a wholly owned subsidiary of tianjin materials and equipment co  which ranks th among china s top enterprises with recent revenues of over billion 
we may need to raise additional capital to acquire additional profit making operations 
to assist the government mandated consolidation of the coal industry  the provincial government has made debt financing available for up to of the purchase price of each mine acquisition through commercial banks for government supported consolidators 
on september   the company received a letter of endorsement from the industrial and commercial bank of china stating that the corporate banking department of the guizhou province branch is willing to support our plan of consolidation 
the bank has indicated that it will provide up to financing for acquisitions for a period of time no greater than five years subject to due diligence on each acquisition 
the company will continue to recruit talented professionals to strengthen our team at the board  officer  and management levels 
our board is composed mostly of independent directors who are predominately us citizens 
their experience ranges from a leader in clean energy to a former member of congress and cabinet secretary of the us department of commerce and the us department of transportation 
we recently recruited a world renowned expert in coal mining who had chaired the department of mine engineering at west virginia university and a former senior executive with the largest coal company in the world 
officers include the founder of the company  a chief financial officer who was a partner with ernst young  two former senior white house staffers  one of whom is also the former director of the united states mint 
we have recruited key managers to augment our legal  accounting  and operations departments in both the united states and china  many who were trained in the united states and have advanced degrees in business 
the company s immediate mission is to become a leading coal energy company in the coal rich yunnan and guizhou provinces 
to meet the government mandated production targets for each holding company in guizhou  we believe that the company s production capacity will increase to between  and  tons per year by end of discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
our actual results have generally not differed materially from our estimates 
however  we monitor such differences and  in the event that actual results are significantly different from those estimated  we disclose any related impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
note 
to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k provides a description of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity use of estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
estimate of recoverable coal reserves 
the company capitalizes its mineral rights at fair value when acquired  including amounts associated with any value beyond proven and probable reserves  and amortized to operations as depletion expense using the units of production method over the estimated recoverable coal 
estimate impairment of long lived assets the company applies the provisions of asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated from such assets 
asc requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
loss on long lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal 
based on its review  the company believes that as of april  and  there was no impairment of its long lived assets 
estimate impairment intangibles the company applies accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other intangible assets  to record goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  certain intangible assets are to be assessed periodically for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of the company s fiscal year  or more frequently when impairment indicators arise 
the company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and takes into account events and circumstances which indicate that impairment exists 
the company believes that as of april  and  there was no impairment of its goodwill 
estimate of the fair value measurements for certain of the company s financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  other receivable  accounts payable and other payables  the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
in addition  the company has long term debt with financial institutions 
the carrying amounts of the line of credit and other long term liabilities approximate their fair values based on current rates of interest for instruments with similar characteristics 
asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the company 
asc  financial instruments  defines fair value  and establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables  certain other current assets and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the company did not identify any other non recurring assets and liabilities that are required to be presented in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with asc revenue recognition in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic  revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company must meet all of the following four criteria under sab to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances from customers 
accounts receivable the company s policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves 
as of april  and  the company determined that no reserve for accounts receivable was necessary 
no allowance for doubtful accounts or sales returns deemed necessary 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value  as determined on moving average basis 
foreign currency translation the accounts of the company s chinese subsidiaries are maintained in the rmb and the accounts of the us parent company are maintained in the usd 
the accounts of the chinese subsidiaries were translated into usd in accordance with asc topic  foreign currency matters  with the rmb as the functional currency for the chinese subsidiaries 
according to asc  all assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date  stockholders equity is translated at historical rates and statement of income items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income in accordance with asc topic  comprehensive income 
gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the statements of income 
asset retirement cost and obligation asset retirement costs are accounted for in accordance with asc topic  asset retirement obligations 
pursuant to asc  the company recognizes the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation  which is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
in subsequent periods  the retirement obligation is accreted to its future value  which is the estimate of the obligation at the asset retirement date 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated or depleted over the useful lives of the respective assets 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss would be recognized at such time 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
gaap also requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
as of april   income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
no material deferred tax amounts were recorded at april  and  respectively 
gaap also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
the charge for taxation is based on the results for the reporting period as adjusted for items  which are non assessable or disallowed 
it is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
the company s operating subsidiaries located in prc are subject to prc income tax 
the new chinese enterprise income tax eit law was effective on january  under the new income tax laws of prc  a company is generally subject to income tax at an effective rate of on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriated tax adjustments 
stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period by using the black scholes option pricing model 
under asc  the company s volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock or the expected volatility of similar companies 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
comparison of the fiscal years ended april  and our operating results during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  reflect a decline mostly due to the temporary government mandated idling and slowdowns from nearby fatal accidents in non l l energy  inc mines 
because all area mines were impacted  there were also less raw coal supplies for our coal washing  coking  and wholesale and distribution segments however  in the last two months of q fy  our mines were on their way to producing to their approved levels  leading the turnaround of our coal mining segment  which is our main business 
the results of operations attributable to each of our segments coal mining  wholesale coal  coking  and coal washing is discussed in detail below 
coal mining segment in april  we sold our interest on ping yi mine and coal washing plant back to the original owner 
ping yi s operational performance was under our target due mostly to production disruptions from sequential two major fatal mine accidents nearby 
there was also larger than expected capital expenditures to upgrade safety and expanding the production capacity  and very little clarity on when the government would approve the mine operating at full production capacity 
because the company owned ping yi for almost the whole fiscal year  to provide a thorough comparison  the coal mining segment analysis is separated into a table for continued operations which exclude ping yi mine and discontinued operations which include only ping yi mine 
the following tables summarize the year to year operating data for our coal mining segment for continued operations exclude ping yi coal mine years ended april  increase decrease coal mining revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coal mining cost of goods sold average coal mining cost of goods sold per ton coal mining selling  general and administrative expense average coal mining selling  general and administrative expense per ton coal mining operating income expense average coal mining operating income per ton for discontinued operations ping yi mine years ended april  increase decrease coal mining revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coal mining cost of goods sold average coal mining cost of goods sold per ton coal mining selling  general and administrative expense average coal mining selling  general and administrative expense per ton coal mining operating income expense average coal mining operating income per ton coal mining revenue total coal mining revenue decreased for our continued operations during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april   primarily as a result of the temporary government mandated idling because of the nearby fatal accidents in non llen mines 
in addition  in some cases  the company elected to slowdown production in some mines for construction related to increasing the production capacity 
the average price per ton during the year ended april  increased because the domestic demand of coal is still relatively strong but the supply of coal did not meet the demand because of the government mandated idling and slowdowns of many mines in the area 
this also led to an impact on the amount of tons we sold in this year 
tons sold in fy fell as the government mandated that area mines complete a series of safety inspections  even if the mine does not have an accident record 
also  because most of our mines are undergoing an expansion of production capacity  there was a small amount of coal is a byproduct of the construction process 
however  q production exceeded each of the prior four quarters  driven by our mines ramping up to their approved production levels during the last two months of the quarter 
for the discontinued operation ping yi mine  the tons sold in fy dropped  coal mining revenue decreased  which in turn led to a high cost of goods sold per ton and high average sg a per ton 
coal mining cost of sales for the continued operations excluding ping yi mine  the tons of sold in the fiscal year ended april  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended april  and the total cost of goods sold still increased 
during the government mandated idling and slowdown of area mines  there are still considerable maintenance that still needs to be performed even when the mine does not extract any coal and with the company used the idling and slowdowns to continue the expansion of production capacity  which together led to extra labor costs 
the average cost of goods sold per ton increased 
meanwhile  the increase in coal mining cost of sales was also impacted by the increase in the cost of both direct labor wages and direct materials inflation in price of raw materials 
lastly  the depreciation related to our investments in infrastructure  allocated as a direct expense  increased during the period 
coal mining sg a for the continued operations excluding ping yi mine  total coal mining selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately during the year ended april  our increase in real dollar fixed cost was related to hiring additional personnel associated with sales  maintenance  safety  and training 
wholesale segment the following table is a summary of important year to year operating data for our wholesale segment years ended april  increase decrease wholesale coal revenue tons sold average price per ton sold wholesale coal cost of goods sold average wholesale coal cost of goods sold per ton wholesale coal selling  general and administrative expense average wholesale coal selling  general and administrative expense per ton wholesale coal operating income expense average wholesale coal operating income per ton wholesale revenue wholesale revenues decreased by during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  even though the average price per ton sold increased  the tons sold decreased during the same period 
the decrease in revenue was fueled both by a shortage of coal supplies because of the government mandated temporary slowdowns and idling of area mines and also because the sometimes cheaper imported coal from other countries decreased some of the domestic demand for local coal even though coal consumption has generally increased in china 
wholesale cost of sales wholesale cost of goods sold decreased while the average whole sale cost of goods sold per ton increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this result was primarily based on the wage structure of our wholesale team  which is base salary plus a bonus according to the sales target achievement 
the company believes that the wholesale and distribution market will recover because imported coal is beginning to loose its competitive advantage  and as a result  we have expanded our operations by establishing our third coal wholesale and distribution entity  daxing l l coal co  ltd 
in guizhou and we own a equity interest in daxing 
wholesale sg a total wholesale sg a decreased while the average sg a per ton rose during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the result was primarily based on the wage structure of our wholesale team with base salary plus a bonus according to the sales target achievement 
also  the average sg a per ton increased because the start up costs of the recently established daxing l l coal co  ltd 
coke segment the following table is a summary of the year to year operating data for our coke segment years ended april  increase decrease coke revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coke cost of goods sold average coke cost of goods sold per ton coke selling  general and administrative expense average coke selling  general and administrative expense per ton coke operating income expense coke operating income per ton coking revenue coking revenue for the year ended april  decreased the average price per ton sold increased and the number of tons sold decreased compared to the year ended april  initially  the decrease was attributed to the shortage of raw coal sources because of the government mandated temporary slowdowns and idling of area mines 
however  new changes in government regulations and new environmental standards that were recently implemented  have led to the the possible acceleration of our expansion plans and possible increased capital expenditures  in addition to some increased expenditures 
additionally  our coking segment experienced a sharp downturn in q due to slow steel demand and resulting high stockpiles of coking coal 
therefore production at our zonelin coking plant at the end of the quarter was minimal 
coke cost of sales coking cost of goods sold decreased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  coke sg a coke sg a increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  due to the additional expenses to comply with changing government regulations and new environmental standards 
coal washing segment in april  we sold our interest on ping yi mine and coal washing plant back to the original owners 
ping yi s operational performance was under our target due mostly to production disruptions from sequential two major fatal mine accidents nearby 
coupled with larger than expected capital expenditures to upgrade the safety and expanding the production capacity  and there was little clarity on when the government would approve the mine operating at full production capacity 
because the company owned ping yi for almost the whole fiscal year  to provide a thorough comparison  the coal washing segment analysis is separated into a table for continued operations which exclude ping yi mine and discontinued operations which include only ping yi 
the following tables summarize the year to year operating data for our coal washing segment for continued operations excluding ping yi washing plant years ended april  increase decrease coal washing revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coal washing cost of goods sold average coal washing cost of goods sold per ton coal washing selling  general and administrative expense average coal washing selling  general and administrative expense per ton coal washing operating income expense average coal washing operating income expense for discontinued operations ping yi washing plant years ended april  increase decrease coal washing revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coal washing cost of goods sold average coal washing cost of goods sold per ton coal washing selling  general and administrative expense average coal washing selling  general and administrative expense per ton coal washing operating income expense average coal washing operating income expense coal washing revenue for continued operations excluding ping yi washing plant  coal washing revenue increased in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in revenue was primarily a result of the increase of average price per ton sold 
the average price per ton sold increased the tons sold decreased by in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  coal washing cost of sales for continued operations excluding ping yi washing plant  coal washing cost of sales increased in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in cost of sales was primarily the result of the increase of revenue 
the average cost of goods sold per ton increased slightly during the year fy as government mandated slow down increased the price of raw coal 
coal washing sg a for continued operations excluding ping yi washing plant  coal washing sg a decreased and average sg a decreased in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the average coal washing operating income increased during the fy was primarily a result of a increased on the average price per ton sold 
comparison of the years ended april  and our operating results during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  reflect strong growth and  in particular  organic expansion of current operations 
in the year ended april   we invested in and increased the capacity of two of our current mines  dapuan and sutsong each from  tons to  tons  and we finished construction of a  ton dms coal washing facility at ping yi mine site 
during the year ended april   we also acquired a majority interest in daping mine  which added additional capacity of  tons per year 
the results of operations attributable to each of our segments coal mining  wholesale coal  coke  and coal washing is discussed in detail below 
coal mining segment the following table is a summary of important year to year operating data for our coal mining segment years ended april  increase decrease coal mining revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coal mining cost of goods sold average coal mining cost of goods sold per ton coal mining selling  general and administrative expense average coal mining selling  general and administrative expense per ton coal mining operating income expense average coal mining operating income per ton coal mining revenue total coal mining revenue increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april   primarily as a result of strong organic growth 
revenue from the daping mine generally did not impact revenue in the year ended april   as the acquisition of such mine was completed late in the year strength in our organic coal sales in the year ended april  is chiefly attributable to our investment in mechanization and mine infrastructure  both of which allow us to increase the productivity of our mines 
we also continued to benefit from growth in china s economy and the resultant demand for energy 
in particular  the china central government western development program  a government mandate for additional energy to fuel economic growth  creates significant demand for coal and coal related products in our markets 
average price per ton during the year ended april  remained steady  compared to the year ended april   primarily due to a price freeze implemented by the government 
the company is vertically integrated and was able to manage price volatility in the year ended april   to a certain extent  by selling some production from ping yi coal mine to ping yi coal washing plant the net effect of which is eliminated via inter company sales in our financial statements 
ping yi mine accounted for of the company s total production volume in the year ended april  our coal mining sales in the fourth quarter of the year ended april  decreased relative to the rest of the year  partly due to normal seasonal adjustment coal prices typically fall as the weather gets warmer  and partly due to government mandated shut downs at several of our mines 
we are occasionally obligated to shut down our mines  through no fault of our own  when other mines in our regions experience accidents or safety violations 
there were fatal mining accidents in yunnan province and fatal accidents in pan county of guizhou province during the fourth quarter of the year ended april   and these events prompted several shut downs at our facilities 
none of these accidents or fatalities happened in l l properties 
coal mining cost of sales total coal mining cost of goods sold increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  and during the year ended april  relative to revenues for the same period 
the relative increase in coal mining cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in the cost of both direct labor wages and direct materials inflation in price of raw materials 
to a lesser extent  we experienced an increase in the direct cost of extraction due to increased direct safety and the maintenance costs in our mining operations 
lastly  the depreciation related to our investments in infrastructure  allocated as a direct expense  increased during the period 
coal mining sg a total coal mining selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately million during the year ended april   but was approximately unchanged relative to revenues 
our increase in real dollar fixed cost was related to hiring additional personnel associated with sales  maintenance  safety  and training

wholesale cost of sales wholesale cost of sales increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this increase was primarily a result of a doubling of tons sold 
wholesale cost of goods sold increased relative to sales due to inflation in the cost of fine coal 
wholesale sg a wholesale sg a increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this increase was primarily a result of an large increase in sales 
wholesale sg a increased approximately relative to sales due to increased selling expense related to shipping terms and increases in the price of fuel

coal washing cost of sales coal washing cost of sales increased approximately in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this was primarily attributable to the increased capacity added to our ping yi facility 
we were also able to benefit from a slight decrease in our washing cost inputs during the year ended april   including buying coal more cheaply and efficiently  while managing to increase its selling prices 
the average selling price of coal increased over while average direct costs per ton slightly increased about 
the effect was that gross profits increased about per ton during the year 
coal washing sg a coal washing sg a increased approximately million in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this was primarily due to our investment in the ping yi facility mentioned above 
depreciation related to the facility increased markedly during the year ended april  because the facility transferred from in process construction status to a fixed asset 
as part of the ramp up to full production capacity  the company also added administrative and safety staff and bought maintenance  safety  and training equipment that  in total  equated to a per ton additional expense

we increased the capacity of dapuan and sutsong mines each to  tons during the year ended april   and we acquired ping yi mine during the third quarter of the fiscal year 
coal mining cost of sales total coal mining cost of goods sold decreased relative to sales 
the positive margin movement was primarily a result of decreased extraction costs  including both labor and direct materials  related to efficiencies and economies of scale in our mines 
coal mining sg a total coal mining selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately million during the year ended april   but was down relative to revenues due to operating leverage in our fixed expenses

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash include cash on hand  cash from sales of coal production to our customers  borrowings under credit facilities  proceeds from financing transactions  and occasional sales of non core assets 
we believe the principal indicator of our liquidity is our cash position 
as of april   our cash and cash equivalents was our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production  capital expenditures and related construction in progress  installment payments related to acquisitions  debt service costs interest and principal  and lease obligations in regards to office space and related equipment 
our principal liquidity requirement is working capital to finance our coal production 
we generally fund both our operations and our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in our net income reduced approximately million in this period caused by the periodical provincial safety closures of mines all mines in yunnan province were covered 
besides  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april  was also mainly contributed by i increase in depreciation and amortization of million  ii increase in cash inflow of accounts receivables of million due to timely settlement by the customers  iii increase in cash inflow of prepayment and other current assets of million and decrease in cash outflow of account payable and other payable by million  which were due to the decrease in material and supplies purchases used in the production  iv increase in cash inflow of note receivables by m due to increase in settlement as of april  net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended april  compared to  for the year ended april  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was mainly due to the net effect of i increase in cash outflow from disposal of business  net cash disposed of million upon the disposal of pingyi mine in the current year  ii decrease in out flow in loan to related party of million since no loan to related party was granted in the current year 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in this decrease is attributable to periodical provincial safety closures in our mines 
for the year ended april   net cash used in investing activities was  compared to  for the year ended april  this decrease was mainly attributable to the company executing fewer acquisitions of new assets in fy compared to fy net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in this was a result of a decrease in issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in this increase is attributable to cash improvements incurred due to an increase in net income  which was mainly due to the acquisition of hong xing and zone lin 
for the year ended april   net cash used in investing activities was  compared to  for the year ended april  this increase was mainly due to an increase in construction in progress and the purchase of additional property plant and equipment in line with our organic growth plans of acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended april  compared to  during the same period in this was a result of increase in issuance of common stock capital expenditures our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for  among other things  developing our mines and purchasing and upgrading equipment 
we also make investments to improve the productivity of our operations and comply with local license and safety regulations 
we have historically funded  and expect to continue to fund  capital expenditures predominantly with cash from operations 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended april  we expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately million for equipment and infrastructure  based on our existing coal operations  for the year ending april  working capital during the year ended april  our accounts receivable ar increased million 
the increase in ar balance is primarily attributable to ar increases in tf  which was established in april of  our kmc s and tni s subsidiaries 
during the year ended april   our accounts payable decreased by million 
accounts payable decreased in this fiscal year due to the decrease in purchase of material  supplies and services used in production 
our production level went down in this fiscal year was mainly caused by the periodical provincial safety closure of our mines 
our inventories decreased by million in this fiscal year 
we carried lower level of inventories was due to increased market demand of the goods and decreased production during the year 
during the year ended april   our other payables increased by million 
the increase in other payable balance is primarily due to the acquisition of wei she mine 
we booked the estimated resource surcharge payable of million 
construction in progress construction in progress represents the company s in progress  not yet capitalized  investment in infrastructure 
construction in progress for the year ended april  includes mine development  ventilation and electrical system improvements  building of staff quarters  beginning construction of a sewage treatment system  and road expansion 
construction in progress totaled million as of april  management presently believes that cash flow from operations and increasing access to credit will provide the company sufficient capital resources for the infrastructure  mechanization  and safety elements of its business strategy 
to implement its acquisition strategy  in conjunction with the government mandated consolidation of mines  the company may consider the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
in addition to potential externally raised funds  the company intends to utilize a combination of existing cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and seller paper to finance the acquisition of mines 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements for the fiscal year ended april    and contractual obligations as of april   we were contractually obligated  per our purchase agreements  to inject capital as follows total less than year years years after years dapuan sutsong mines l l yunnan tianneng industry daping coal mine tai fung total during the fourth quarter of  as part of the acquisition of daping mine  the company assumed a rmb million bank loan or approximately  with an interest rate of per annum 
the company had paid rmb million or approximately thousands and the other rmb million or approximately million will mature on october  insurance we operate coal mines and related facilities that are inherently dangerous 
we  like other similar companies  have experienced accidents that have caused property damage and personal injuries 
although we have implemented safety measures such as fire training and job specific safety training  and we continuously review our existing operational standards  there can be no assurance that natural disasters and industry related accidents will not occur in the future 
the insurance industry in china is in a developmental stage  and chinese insurance companies offer only limited business insurance products 
we currently purchase work related injury insurance for our employees at the dapuan  sutsong ping yi and da ping mines  and limited accident insurance for staff working in china 
insurance related liabilities and losses above our coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
environmental compliance we are subject to significant  extensive and increasingly stringent environmental protection laws 
these laws and regulations impose fees for the discharge of waste substances and pollutants  require the establishment of reserves for reclamation and rehabilitation  impose fines for serious environmental offenses  and authorize the prc government  at its discretion  to close or suspend any facility that it determines has failed to comply with environmental regulations 
the prc government has tightened enforcement of applicable laws and regulations and adopted more stringent environmental and operational standards 
while we believe that our coal mining  washing  and coking operations currently comply in all material respects with existing chinese environmental standards  future environmental related issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations
