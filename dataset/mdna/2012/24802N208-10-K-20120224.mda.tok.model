overview we are a leader in an internet based model for the professional creation and distribution of high quality  commercially valuable  long lived content at scale 
our business is comprised of two distinct and complementary service offerings content media and registrar 
our content media offering is engaged in creating media content  primarily consisting of text articles and videos  and delivering it along with our social media and monetization tools to our owned and operated websites and to our network of customer websites 
our content media service offering also includes a number of websites primarily containing advertising listings  which we refer to as undeveloped websites 
our registrar is the world s largest wholesale registrar of internet domain names and the world s second largest registrar overall  based on the number of names under management  and provides domain name registration and related value added services 
our principal operations and decision making functions are located in the united states 
we report our financial results as one operating segment  with two distinct service offerings 
our operating results are regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker on a consolidated basis  principally to make decisions about how we allocate our resources and to measure our consolidated operating performance 
together  our service offerings provide us with proprietary data that enable commercially valuable  long lived content production at scale combined with broad distribution and targeted monetization capabilities 
we currently generate the vast majority of our content media revenue through the sale of advertising  and to a lesser extent through subscriptions to our social media applications and licensing and sales of select content and service offerings 
substantially all of our registrar revenue is derived from domain name registration and related value added service subscriptions 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews revenue for each of our content media and registrar service offerings in order to gain more depth and understanding of the key business metrics driving our business 
accordingly  we report content media and registrar revenue separately 
in january  we completed our initial public offering and received proceeds  net of underwriters discounts but before deducting offering expenses  of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock 
as a result of the initial public offering  all shares of our convertible preferred stock converted into million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock or convertible preferred stock net exercised into million shares of common stock 
for the years ended december   and  we reported revenue of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  our content media offering accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively  and our registrar service accounted for  and of our total revenue  respectively 
key business metrics we regularly review a number of business metrics  including the following key metrics  to evaluate our business  measure the performance of our business model  identify trends impacting our business  determine resource allocations  formulate financial projections and make strategic business decisions 
measures which we believe are the primary indicators of our performance are as follows content media metrics page views we define page views as the total number of web pages viewed across our owned and operated websites and or our network of customer websites  to the extent that the viewed customer web pages host the company s monetization  social media and or content services 
page views are primarily tracked through internal systems  such as our omniture web analytics tool  contain estimates for our customer websites using our social media tools and may use data compiled from certain customer websites 
we periodically review and refine our methodology for monitoring  gathering  and counting page views in an effort to improve the accuracy of our measure 
rpm we define rpm as content media revenue per one thousand page views 
registrar metrics domain we define a domain as an individual domain name paid for by a third party customer where the domain name is managed through our registrar service offering 
beginning july   the number of net new domains has been adjusted to include only new registered domains added to our platform for which we have recognized revenue 
this metric does not include any of the company s owned and operated websites 
average revenue per domain we calculate average revenue per domain by dividing registrar revenues for a period by the average number of domains registered in that period 
the average number of domains is the simple average of the number of domains at the beginning and end of the period 
the following table sets forth additional performance highlights of key business metrics for the periods presented to to year ended december  change change content media metrics owned operated page views in millions rpm network of customer websites page views in millions rpm rpm ex tac registrar metrics end of period of domains in millions average revenue per domain for a discussion of these period to period changes in the number of page views  rpm  end of period domains and average revenue per domain and how they impacted our financial results  see results of operations below 
beginning july   the number of net new domains has been adjusted to include only new registered domains added to our platform for which we have recognized revenue 
excluding the impact of this change  end of period domains at december  would have increased and average revenue per domain during the year ended december  would have decreased  each compared to the corresponding prior year periods 
opportunities  challenges and risks to date  we have derived the majority of our revenue through the sale of advertising in connection with our content media service offering and through domain name registration subscriptions in our registrar service offering 
our advertising revenue is primarily generated by advertising networks  which include both performance based internet advertising  such as cost per click where an advertiser pays only when a user clicks on its advertisement  and display internet advertising where an advertiser pays when the advertising is displayed 
for the year ended december   the majority of our advertising revenue was generated by our relationship with google 
we deliver online advertisements provided by google on our owned and operated websites as well as on certain of our customer websites where we share a portion of the advertising revenue 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total consolidated revenue was derived from our advertising and content arrangements with google 
google maintains the direct relationships with the advertisers and provides us with cost per click and display advertising services 
our historical growth in content media revenue has principally come from growth in rpms and page views due to both the increased volume of commercially valuable content published on our owned and operated websites as well as an increase in the number of visitors to our existing content 
to a lesser extent  content media revenue growth has resulted from the publishing of our content on our network of customer websites and from utilizing our social media tools on certain of these sites 
we believe that there are opportunities to grow our revenue and our page views by creating and publishing more content in a greater variety of formats on our owned and operated sites as well as by increasing our distribution to and expanding our network of customer websites 
we also believe there is long term revenue growth opportunity from improving advertising yields to several of our owned and network websites and from introducing innovative new products 
we believe that there is an opportunity to accelerate the growth of our content media service offering by publishing and distributing our content to an expanding number of distribution outlets 
for example  we launched our premium multi channel youtube initiative in december  and we currently have arrangements with a number of third party customers to distribute and license our content on their websites 
during the second half of  we also expanded distribution to our network of customer websites via our acquisition of indieclick and believe that indieclick s innovative product offerings provide us an opportunity to increase revenue 
throughout  google deployed a series of changes to its search engine algorithms  some of which led the company to experience a substantial reduction in the total number of google search referrals to its owned and operated websites 
the overall impact of these changes on the company s owned and operated websites was negative  primarily due to a decline in traffic to ehow 
com beginning in the second quarter of due to the timing of the most significant changes  the vast majority of the adverse impact on ehow 
com full year revenue was concentrated in the second half of during the fourth quarter of and in response to the various changes in search engine algorithms  we performed an evaluation of our existing content library 
as a result of this evaluation  we elected to remove certain content assets from service  resulting in million of accelerated amortization expense in the fourth quarter of the evaluation is expected to be completed in the first quarter of and any further potential discretionary changes are not anticipated to result in acceleration of amortization greater than million in that period 
we intend to evolve and continuously improve our content creation and distribution platform through a number of initiatives  including creating new content formats to meet rapidly changing consumer demand 
such changes may include increasing our investment in video and long form content  increasing and expanding distribution of our content to our network of customer websites and an overall reduction in the volume of shorter form text articles published on ehow 
com 
in the near term we also anticipate increased expenditures in non algorithmic content such as premium video  longer form and photo centric content designed to further enhance user engagement 
these potential changes to our content creation platform could increase our per unit content creation costs  including costs associated with our community of creative professionals  potentially resulting in higher service costs as a percentage of revenue if the changes are unsuccessful in generating additional revenue 
while we assess such improvements to our content creation and distribution platform  we have begun and expect to maintain a reduced level of overall investment in media content when compared to historical amounts 
there can be no assurance that these or any future changes that may be implemented by the company  by search engines to their algorithms and search methodologies  or by consumers in their web usage habits might not adversely impact the carrying value  estimated useful life or intended use of our long lived assets 
the company will continue to monitor these changes as well as any future changes and emerging trends in search engine algorithms and methodologies  including the resulting impact that these changes may have on future operating results  the economic performance of the company s long lived assets and in its assessment as to whether significant changes in circumstances might provide an indication of potential impairment of the carrying value of its long lived assets  including its media content and goodwill arising from acquisitions 
while we experienced a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock over the course of  our market capitalization remained in excess of the carrying value of our net assets throughout the year 
based upon our annual goodwill impairment test that we performed in the fourth quarter of  the indicated fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying value and that the fair value of our content media reporting unit  which includes our entire library of content assets  exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
the growth in our registrar revenue is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers to our registrar platform through competitive pricing on domain registrations and value added services 
beginning in the first quarter of and extending through the first quarter of  we added several customers with large volumes of domains to our registrar platform 
this resulted in fluctuations in our average revenue per domain over these periods  from which we only recognized revenue on a portion of these domain names while deferring revenue recognition on the remainder 
beginning july   we adjusted the number of net new domains to include only new registered domains added to our platform for which we have recognized revenue 
excluding the impact of this change  end of period domains at december  would have increased and average revenue per domain during the year ended december  would have decreased  each compared to the corresponding prior year periods 
in the near term  we anticipate our average revenue per domain to continue to fluctuate as a result of the large volume customers added in and certain registry price increases in early due in part to the higher mix of large volume customers as we enter as compared to  we also expect that our overall service costs as a percentage of our total revenue will increase when compared to our historical results 
the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers  or icann has approved a framework for the significant expansion of the number of generic top level domain tlds  or gtlds in we believe that such expansion  once completed  will result in an increase in the number of domains registered on our platform in in addition  we believe that the new gtld program could also provide us with new revenue opportunities in  which include operating the back end infrastructure for new tld registries and or owning one or more tlds in our own right 
in preparation for the new gtld program  we also expect to incur up to million of operating expenses in our service costs  the largest component of our operating expenses  can vary from period to period  particularly as a percentage of revenue  based upon the mix of the underlying content media and registrar services revenues we generate 
in the near term and consistent with historical trends  we expect that the period over period growth in our content media revenue will continue to exceed the growth in our registrar revenue  which would typically provide for higher operating margins 
we expect that service costs will increase in compared to in line with revenue growth and also due to our new premium multi channel initiative with youtube as well the impact of our acquisition of indieclick 
we believe that these factors  together with costs associated with our investment in new business initiatives in  including our preparation for new gtlds becoming available for registration in  will result in our operating margin in being fairly consistent with our content studio identifies and creates online text articles and videos through a community of freelance creative professionals and is core to our business strategy and long term growth initiatives 
historically  we have made substantial investments in our platform to support our expanding community of freelance creative professionals and the growth of our content production and distribution and expect to continue to make such investments 
as we develop new content formats  we may not be able to attract and retain qualified creative professionals to produce such new content at scale  which may adversely impact our ability to execute against emerging business opportunities or retain existing content creators 
for the year ended december   more than of our revenue has been derived from websites and customers located in the united states 
while our content is primarily targeted towards english speaking users in the united states today  we believe that there is an opportunity in the longer term for us to create content targeted to users outside of the united states and thereby increase our revenue generated from countries outside of the united states 
we plan to further expand our operations internationally to address this opportunity  including through our recent acquisition of a latin american language content creation company in july and the launch of ehow en espa ol and ehow brasil in the second half of as we expand our business internationally  we may incur additional expenses associated with this growth initiative 
basis of presentation revenue our revenue is derived from our content media and registrar service offerings 
content media revenue we currently generate the vast majority of our content media revenue through the sale of advertising  and to a lesser extent through subscriptions to our social media applications and licensing and sales of select content and service offerings 
our revenue generating advertising arrangements  for both our owned and operated websites and our network of customer websites  include cost per click performance based advertising  display advertisements where revenue is dependent upon the number of page views  and lead generating advertisements where revenue is dependent upon users registering for  or purchasing or demonstrating interest in  advertisers products and services 
we generate revenue from advertisements displayed alongside our content offered to consumers across a broad range of topics and categories on our owned and operated websites and on certain customer websites 
our advertising revenue also includes revenue derived from cost per click advertising links we place on undeveloped websites owned both by us  which we acquire and sell on a regular basis  and certain of our customers 
to a lesser extent  we also generate revenue from our subscription based offerings  which include our social media applications deployed on our network of customer websites and subscriptions to premium content or services offered on certain of our owned and operated websites 
where we enter into revenue sharing arrangements with our customers  such as those relating to indieclick and our undeveloped customer websites  and when we are considered the primary obligor  we report the underlying revenue on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations  and record these revenue sharing payments to our customers as traffic acquisition costs  or tac  which are included in service costs 
in circumstances where we distribute our content on third party websites and the customer acts as the primary obligor we recognize revenue on a net basis 
registrar revenue our registrar revenue is principally comprised of registration fees charged to resellers and consumers in connection with new  renewed and transferred domain name registrations 
in addition  our registrar also generates revenue from the sale of other value added services that are designed to help our customers easily build  enhance and protect their domains  including security services  e mail accounts and web hosting 
finally  we generate revenue from fees related to auction services we provide to facilitate the selling of third party owned domains 
our registrar revenue varies based upon the number of domains registered  the rates we charge our customers and our ability to sell value added services 
we market our registrar wholesale services under our enom brand  and our retail registration services under the enomcentral brand  among others 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of service costs  sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  and amortization of intangible assets 
included in our operating expenses are stock based compensation and depreciation expenses associated with our capital expenditures 
service costs service costs consist of fees paid to registries and icann associated with domain registrations  advertising revenue recognized by us and shared with others as a result of our revenue sharing arrangements  such as tac and content creator revenue sharing arrangements  internet connection and co location charges and other platform operating expenses including depreciation of the systems and hardware used to build and operate our content media platform and registrar  personnel costs related to in house editorial  customer service and information technology  and certain content production costs such as our new premium multi channel video deal with youtube 
we anticipate that content production costs will comprise a higher proportion of total service costs in than prior years as we increase our production of non algorithm based content under the new premium multi channel video initiative with youtube and similar contracts 
our service costs are dependent on a number of factors  including the number of page views generated across our platform and the volume of domain registrations and value added services supported by our registrar 
in the near term and consistent with historical trends  we expect that the period over period growth in our content media revenue will continue to exceed the growth in our registrar revenue  and as a result  we expect our overall service costs as a percentage of our total revenue to continue to decrease when compared to our historical results 
however  we do expect that the new premium multi channel initiative with the production of video for youtube  an increase in advertising revenue through third party publishers resulting from our acquisition of indieclick and higher overall registration costs due to registry price increases in together with costs associated with our investment in new business initiatives in including our preparation for new gtlds becoming available for registration in will result in higher service costs when compared to historical results 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing personnel costs  sales support  public relations  advertising and promotional expenditures 
fluctuations in our sales and marketing expenses are generally the result of our efforts to support the growth in our content media service  including expenses required to support the expansion of our direct advertising sales force 
we currently anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase and will increase in the near term as a percent of revenue as we continue to build our sales and marketing organizations to support the growth of our business 
product development product development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in our software engineering  product development and web design activities and related personnel costs 
fluctuations in our product development expenses are generally the result of hiring personnel to support and develop our platform  including the costs to further develop our content algorithms  our owned and operated websites and future product and service offerings of our registrar 
we currently anticipate that our product development expenses will increase as we continue to hire more product development personnel and further develop our products and offerings to support the growth of our business  but remain flat as a percentage of revenue compared to general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs from our executive  legal  finance  human resources and information technology organizations and facilities related expenditures  as well as third party professional fees  insurance and bad debt expenses 
professional fees are largely comprised of outside legal  audit and information technology consulting 
during the year ended december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense were not significant and we expect that this trend will continue in the near term 
however  as we grow our revenue from direct advertising sales  which tend to have longer collection cycles  our allowance for doubtful accounts may increase  which may lead to increased bad debt expense 
as we continue to expand our business and incur additional expenses associated with being a publicly traded company  we anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase in the near term  but at a lesser rate than our projected revenue growth 
specifically  we expect that we will incur additional general and administrative expenses to provide insurance for our directors and officers and to comply with the regulatory and listing exchange requirements 
amortization of intangibles we capitalize certain costs allocated to the purchase price of certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations  to acquire content that our models show embody probable economic benefit  and to acquire undeveloped websites  including initial registration costs 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the related expected useful lives of these assets  which have a weighted average useful life of approximately years on a combined basis as of december  we estimate our capitalized content to have a weighted average useful life of years as of december  the company determines the appropriate useful life of intangible assets by performing an analysis of expected cash flows based on its historical experience of intangible assets of similar quality and value 
we expect amortization expense to decrease in the near term as we intend to reduce our investment in content intangible assets as compared to the prior year 
amortization as percentage of revenue will depend upon a variety of factors  such as the amounts and mix of our investments in content and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
stock based compensation included in our operating expenses are expenses associated with stock based compensation  which are allocated and included in service costs  sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses 
stock based compensation expense is largely comprised of costs associated with stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees  restricted stock issued to employees and expenses relating to our employee stock purchase plan 
we record the fair value of these equity based awards and expense their cost ratably over related vesting periods 
in addition  stock based compensation expense includes the cost of warrants to purchase common and preferred stock issued to certain non employees 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we recognized approximately million in additional stock based compensation related to awards granted to certain executive officers in prior years to acquire approximately million of our shares that vested in that quarter upon meeting an average closing price of our stock for a stipulated period of time subsequent to our initial public offering 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized employee related stock based compensation  net of estimated forfeitures  that we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately years 
stock based compensation expense is expected to increase in compared to as a result of our existing unrecognized stock based compensation and as we issue additional stock based awards to continue to attract and retain employees and non employee directors 
interest expense interest expense principally consists of interest on outstanding debt and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our revolving credit facility 
as of december  no principal balance was outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances and short term investments 
we typically invest our available cash balances in money market funds and short term united states treasury obligations 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of transaction gains and losses on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and changes in the value of certain long term investments and prior to our initial public offering changes in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
we expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in underlying currency exchange rates  and could become more significant when we expand internationally 
our preferred stock warrants were net exercised for common stock upon our initial public offering in january and thus we no longer record changes in the value of the warrant subsequent to that date 
provision for income taxes since our inception  we have been subject to income taxes principally in the united states  and certain other countries where we have legal presence  including the united kingdom  the netherlands  canada  sweden and beginning in  ireland and argentina 
we anticipate that as we expand our operations outside the united states  we will become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly 
income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently believe that based on the available information  it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and accordingly we have taken a full valuation allowance against all of our united states deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal and million of state operating loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in varying amounts beginning in for federal and for state purposes if unused 
federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in the event of an ownership change  as defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the internal revenue code 
currently  we do not expect the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards in the near term to be materially affected as no significant limitations are expected to be placed on these carry forwards as a result of our previous ownership changes 
if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred as a result of our initial public offering  potential near term utilization of these assets could be reduced 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with our revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalization and useful lives associated with our intangible assets  including our internal software and website development and content costs  income taxes  stock based compensation and the recoverability of our goodwill and long lived assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  performance of services has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we consider persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement to be the receipt of a signed contract 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including transaction history and the credit worthiness of a customer 
if it is determined that collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is not recognized until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we record cash received in advance of revenue recognition as deferred revenue 
content media advertising services in determining whether an arrangement for our advertising services exists  we ensure that a binding arrangement is in place  such as a standard insertion order or a fully executed customer specific agreement 
obligations pursuant to our advertising revenue arrangements typically include a minimum number of impressions or the satisfaction of the other performance criteria 
revenue from performance based arrangements  including cost per click and referral revenues  is recognized as the related performance criteria are met 
we assess whether performance criteria have been met and whether our fees are fixed or determinable based on a reconciliation of the performance criteria and an analysis of the payment terms associated with a transaction 
the reconciliation of the performance criteria generally includes a comparison of third party performance data  such as periodic online reports provided by certain of our customer websites  to the contractual performance obligation and to internal or customer performance data in circumstances where such data is available 
historically  any difference between the amounts recognized based on preliminary information and cash collected has not been material to our results of operations 
where we enter into revenue sharing arrangements with our customers  such as for the online version of the san francisco chronicle or with respect to undeveloped customer websites  and when we are considered the primary obligor  we report the underlying revenues on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
in circumstances where the customer acts as the primary obligor  such as youtube  we recognize the underlying revenue on a net basis in our statement of operations 
content revenue content revenue is generated through the sale or license of media content 
revenue from the sale or perpetual license of content is recognized when the content has been delivered and the contractual performance obligations have been fulfilled 
revenue from the license of content is recognized over the period of the license as content is delivered or when other related performance criteria are fulfilled 
subscription and social media services subscription services revenue is generated through the sale of membership fees paid to access content available on certain owned and operated websites  such as trails 
com 
the majority of the memberships range from six to twelve month terms  and generally renew automatically at the end of the membership term  if not previously canceled 
membership revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the membership term 
we configure  host and maintain almost all of our platform s social media services for commercial customers 
we earn revenues from our social media services through initial set up fees  recurring management support fees  overage fees in excess of standard usage terms and outside consulting fees 
due to the fact that our social media services customers have no contractual right to take possession of our software  we account for our social media services as subscription service arrangements  whereby social media services revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the service has occurred and no significant obligations remain  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
social media service arrangements may contain multiple elements  including  but not limited to  single arrangements containing set up fees  monthly support fees and overage billings and consulting services 
to the extent that consulting services have value on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of social media services  we allocate revenue to each element based upon each element s objective and reliable evidence of fair value 
objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all elements of a service arrangement is based upon our normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when such services are sold separately 
to date  substantially all consulting services entered into concurrent with the original social media service arrangements are not treated as separate deliverables as such services are essential to the functionality of the hosted social media services and do not have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
such fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the greater of the contractual or estimated customer life once monthly recurring services have commenced 
fees for other items are recognized as follows customer set up fees set up fees are generally paid prior to the commencement of monthly recurring services 
we initially defer set up fees and recognize the related revenue straight line over the greater of the contractual or estimated customer life once monthly recurring services have commenced 
monthly support fees recognized each month at contractual rates 
overage billings recognized when delivered and at contractual rates in excess of standard usage terms 
we determine the estimated customer life based on analysis of historical attrition rates  average contractual term and renewal expectations 
we periodically review the estimated customer life at least quarterly and when events or changes in circumstances  such as significant customer attrition relative to expected historical or projected future results  occur 
outside consulting services performed for customers on a stand alone basis are recognized ratably as services are performed at contractual rates 
registrar domain name registration fees registration fees charged to third parties in connection with new  renewed and transferred domain name registrations are recognized on a straight line basis over the registration term  which range from one to ten years 
payments received in advance of the domain name registration term are included in deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
the registration term and related revenue recognition commences once we confirm that the requested domain name has been recorded in the appropriate registry under accepted contractual performance standards 
associated direct and incremental costs  which principally consist of registry and icann fees  are also deferred and expensed as service costs on a straight line basis over the registration term 
our wholly owned subsidiary  enom  is an icann accredited registrar 
thus  we are the primary obligor with our reseller and retail registrant customers and are responsible for the fulfillment of our registrar services 
as a result  we report revenue derived from the fees we receive from our resellers and retail registrant customers for registrations on a gross basis in our consolidated statements of operations 
a minority of our resellers have contracted with us to provide billing and credit card processing services to the resellers retail customer base in addition to registration services 
under these circumstances  the cash collected from these resellers retail customer base exceeds the fixed amount per transaction that we charge for domain name registration services 
accordingly  these amounts  which are collected for the benefit of the reseller  are not recognized as revenue and are recorded as a liability until remitted to the reseller on a periodic basis 
revenue from these resellers is reported on a net basis because the reseller determines the price to charge retail customers and maintains the primary customer relationship 
value added services revenue from online registrar value added services  which include  but are not limited to  security certificates  domain name identification protection  charges associated with alternative payment methodologies  web hosting services and email services is recognized on a straight line basis over the period in which services are provided 
payments received in advance of services being provided are included in deferred revenue 
auction service revenue domain name auction service revenue represents fees received from facilitating the sale of third party owned domains through an online bidding process primarily through namejet  a domain name aftermarket auction company formed in october by us and an unrelated third party 
while certain names sold through the auction process are registered on our registrar platform upon sale  we have determined that auction revenue and related registration revenue represent separate units of accounting  given that the domain name has value to the customers on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the registration service 
we recognize the related registration fees on a straight line basis over the registration term 
we recognize the bidding portion of auction revenues upon sale  net of payments to third parties since we are acting as an agent only 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third parties who provide advertising services to our owned and operated websites and certain customer websites in exchange for a share of the underlying advertising revenue 
accounts receivable from these advertising providers are recorded as the amount of the revenue share as reported to us by them and are generally due within to days from the month end in which the invoice is generated 
certain accounts receivable from these providers are billed quarterly and are due within days from the quarter end in which the invoice is generated  and are non interest bearing  social media services customers and include account set up fees  which are generally billed and collected once set up services are completed  monthly recurring services  which are billed in advance of services on a quarterly or monthly basis  account overages  which are billed when incurred and contractually due  and consulting services  which are generally billed in the same manner as set up fees 
accounts receivable from social media customers are recorded at the invoiced amount  are generally due within days and are non interest bearing  direct advertisers who engage us to deliver branded advertising views 
accounts receivable from our direct advertisers are recorded at negotiated advertising rates customarily based on advertising impressions and as the related advertising is delivered over our owned and operated websites 
direct advertising accounts receivables are due within to days from the date the advertising services are delivered and billed  and customers who syndicate the company s content over their websites in exchange for a share of related advertising revenue 
accounts receivable from our customers are recorded at the revenue share as reported by our customers and are due within to days 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables from our customers based on our best estimate of the amount of probable losses from existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on analysis of historical bad debts  advertiser concentrations  advertiser credit worthiness and current economic trends 
in addition  past due balances over days and specific other balances are reviewed individually for collectability on at least a quarterly basis 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the acquired net assets 
we perform our impairment testing for goodwill at the reporting unit level 
as of december   we determined that we have three reporting units 
for the purpose of performing the required impairment tests  we primarily apply a present value discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when events or circumstances change that would indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future results of operations 
the testing for a potential impairment of goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units with their respective book values  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary 
if  however  the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value  the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to recognize the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the estimate of the fair value of goodwill is primarily based on an estimate of the discounted cash flows expected to result from that reporting unit and may require valuations of certain recognized and unrecognized intangible assets such as our content  software  technology  patents and trademarks 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
to date  we have not recognized an impairment loss associated with our goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units  using various valuation techniques  with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates 
assumptions about discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
assumptions about sales  operating margins  and growth rates are based on our forecasts  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period 
as of december   the date of the most recent impairment assessment  we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value 
capitalization and useful lives associated with our intangible assets  including content and internal software and website development costs we publish long lived media content generated by our content studio which we commission and acquire from third party freelance creative professionals 
direct costs incurred for each individual content unit that we determine embodies a probable future economic benefit are capitalized 
the vast majority of direct content costs represent amounts paid to freelance creative professionals to acquire content units and  to a lesser extent  specifically identifiable internal direct labor costs incurred to enhance the value of acquired content units prior to their publication 
internal costs not directly attributable to the enhancement of content units acquired prior to publication are expensed as incurred 
all costs incurred to deploy and publish content are expensed as incurred  including the costs incurred for the ongoing maintenance of websites on which our content resides 
we generally acquire content when our internal systems and processes  including an analysis of millions of historical internet search queries  advertising marketing terms  or keywords  and other data provide reasonable assurance that  given predicted consumer and advertiser demand relative to our predetermined cost to acquire the content  the content unit will generate revenues over its useful life that exceed the cost of acquisition 
in determining whether content embodies probable future economic benefit required for asset capitalization  we make judgments and estimates including the forecasted number of page views and the advertising rates that the content will generate 
these estimates and judgments take into consideration various inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  total expected page views over the articles useful life  our expected ability to renew at favorable terms or replace certain material agreements with google that currently provide a significant portion of our revenues  the expected ability of our direct advertising sales force to sell branded advertisements  the fact that our content creation and distribution model is new and evolving and may be impacted by competition and technological advancements  our ability to expand existing and enter into new distribution channels and applications for our content  and whether we will be able to continue to create content of the same quality or generate similar economic returns from content in the future 
management has reviewed  and intends to regularly review the operating performance of content in determining probable future economic benefits of our content 
we also capitalize initial registration and acquisition costs of our undeveloped websites and our internally developed software and website development costs during their development phase 
in addition we have also capitalized certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations and we use valuation techniques to value these intangibles assets  with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions and estimates including projected revenues  operating costs  growth rates  useful lives and discount rates 
our finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  which approximates the estimated pattern in which the underlying economic benefits are consumed 
capitalized website registration costs for undeveloped websites are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of one to seven years 
internally developed software and website development costs are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated three year useful life 
we amortize our intangible assets acquired through business combinations on a straight line basis over the period in which the underlying economic benefits are expected to be consumed 
capitalized content is amortized on a straight line basis over five years  representing our estimate of the pattern that the underlying economic benefits are expected to be realized and based on our estimates of the projected cash flows from advertising revenues expected to be generated by the deployment of our content 
these estimates are based on our current plans and projections for our content  our comparison of the economic returns generated by content of comparable quality and an analysis of historical cash flows generated by that content to date which  particularly for more recent content cohorts  is somewhat limited 
to date  certain content that we acquired in business combinations has generated cash flows from advertisements beyond a five year useful life 
the acquisition of content  at scale  however  is a new and rapidly evolving model  and therefore we closely monitor its performance and  periodically  assess its estimated useful life 
advertising revenue generated from the deployment of our media content makes up a significant element of our business such that amounts we record in our financial statements related to our content are material 
significant judgment is required in estimating the useful life of our content 
changes from the five year useful life we currently use to amortize our capitalized content would have a significant impact on our financial statements 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimate of the weighted average useful life of our media content was higher by one year from january   our net loss would decrease by approximately million for the year ended december   and our net loss would increase by approximately million should the weighted average useful life be reduced by one year 
we periodically assess the useful life of our content  and when adjustments in our estimate of the useful life of content are required  any changes from prior estimates are accounted for prospectively 
recoverability of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets  and other long lived assets with finite useful lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
these trigger events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  significant adverse change in legal factors  including changes that could result from our inability to renew or replace material agreements with certain of our partners such as google on favorable terms  significant adverse changes in the business climate including changes which may result from adverse shifts in technology in our industry and the impact of competition  a significant adverse deterioration in the amount of revenue or cash flows we expect to generate from an asset group  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or development of a long lived asset  current or future operating or cash flow losses that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of our long lived asset  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we perform impairment testing at the asset group level that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
in making this determination  we consider the specific operating characteristics of the relevant long lived assets  including i the nature of the direct and any indirect revenues generated by the assets  ii the interdependency of the revenues generated by the assets  and iii the nature and extent of any shared costs necessary to operate the assets in their intended use 
an impairment test would be performed when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group is less than its carrying amount 
impairment is measured by assessing the usefulness of an asset by comparing its carrying value to its fair value 
if an asset is considered impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
the key estimates applied when preparing cash flow projections relate to revenues  operating margins  economic life of assets  overheads  taxation and discount rates 
to date  we have not recognized any such impairment loss associated with our long lived assets 
income taxes we account for our income taxes using the liability and asset method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or in our tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  generally all expected future events other than enactments or changes in the tax law or rates are considered 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we provide tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws 
tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits  and relevant tax law and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period 
changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax benefit provision in the accompanying statements of operations 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to management s assessment of relevant risks  facts  and circumstances existing at that time 
to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date fair values of the awards 
for stock option awards to employees with service and or performance based vesting conditions  the fair value is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the value of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
we elected to treat share based payment awards  other than performance awards  with graded vesting schedules and time based service conditions as a single award and recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period 
stock based compensation expenses are classified in the statement of operations based on the department to which the related employee reports 
our stock based awards are comprised principally of stock options restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and restricted stock purchase rights 
some employee award grants contain certain performance and or market conditions 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with performance conditions based upon the probability of the performance condition being met  net of an estimate of pre vesting forfeitures 
awards granted with performance and or market conditions are amortized using the graded vesting method 
the effect of a market condition is reflected in the award s fair value on the grant date 
we use a monte carlo simulation model or a binomial lattice model to determine the grant date fair value of awards with market conditions 
all compensation expense for an award that has a market condition is recognized as the requisite service period is fulfilled  even if the market condition is never satisfied 
we account for stock options issued to non employees in accordance with the guidance for equity based payments to non employees 
stock option awards to non employees are accounted for at fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
our management believes that the fair value of stock options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received 
the fair value of the unvested portion of the options granted to non employees is re measured each period 
the resulting increase in value  if any  is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered 
the black scholes option pricing model requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in determining the fair value of our awards 
the most significant assumptions and judgments include estimating the fair value of our underlying stock  the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  the recognition of stock based compensation expense is impacted by estimated forfeiture rates 
because our common stock was not publicly traded since our inception through january   we estimated the expected volatility of our awards from the historical volatility of selected public companies within the internet and media industry with comparable characteristics to us  including similarity in size  lines of business  market capitalization  revenue and financial leverage 
from our inception through december   the weighted average expected life of options was calculated using the simplified method as prescribed under guidance by the sec 
this decision was based on the lack of relevant historical data due to our limited experience and the lack of an active market for our common stock 
effective january   we calculated the weighted average expected life of our options based upon our historical experience of option exercises combined with estimates of the post vesting holding period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury issues with terms approximately equal to the expected life of the option 
the expected dividend rate is zero based on the fact that we currently have no history or expectation of paying cash dividends on our common stock 
the forfeiture rate is established based on the historical average period of time that options were outstanding and adjusted for expected changes in future exercise patterns 
under the company s employee stock purchase plan the espp  eligible officers and employees may purchase a limited amount of our common stock at a discount to the market price in accordance with the terms of the plan as described in note share based compensation plans and awards 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the espp awards granted which is recognized straight line over the total offering period 
some equity awards granted by the company contain certain performance and or market conditions 
the company recognizes compensation cost for awards with performance conditions based upon the probability of that performance condition being met  net of an estimate of pre vesting forfeitures 
awards granted with performance and or market conditions are amortized using the graded vesting method 
the effect of a market condition is reflected in the award s fair value on the grant date 
the company uses a monte carlo simulation model or binomial lattice model to determine the grant date fair value of awards with market conditions 
compensation cost for an award that has a market condition is recognized as the requisite service period is fulfilled  even if the market condition is never satisfied 
stock based awards issued to non employees are accounted for at fair value determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
management believes that the fair value of the stock options is more reliably measured than the fair value of the services received 
the fair value of each non employee stock based compensation award is re measured each period until a commitment date is reached  which is generally the vesting date

the page view increase included the impact of a website product enhancement we implemented in the second quarter of with respect to the presentation of photo centric content on certain of the company s owned and operated sites  which did not impact advertising impressions 
excluding the impact of such change  we estimate that during the year ended december   page views would have increased approximately and rpms would have increased  compared to the corresponding prior year 
the remaining increase in underlying page views was due primarily to increased publishing of our platform content on our owned and operated websites 
the underlying increase in rpms was primarily attributable to the overall increase in page views on ehow  which has higher rpms than the weighted average of our other owned and operated websites  as well as an increase in rpms on the monetization of our undeveloped websites 
in addition  rpm growth was driven by increased display advertising revenue sold directly through our sales force during the year ended december  as compared to on average  our direct display advertising sales generate higher rpms than display advertising that we deliver from our advertising networks  such as google 
compared to content media revenue from our owned and operated websites increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the year over year increase was largely due to increased page views and rpms 
page views on our owned and operated websites increased by  from billion page views in the year ended december  to billion page views in the year ended december  the increase in page views was due primarily to increased publishing of our platform content on our owned and operated websites  offset by a decrease in page views from certain owned and operated websites that are not heavily dependent upon our platform content  such as certain entertainment web properties 
rpms on our owned and operated websites increased by  from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the overall increase in rpms was primarily attributable to the overall increase in page views on ehow  which has higher rpms than the weighted average of our other owned and operated websites  offset by decreased rpms on the monetization of our undeveloped websites  which was largely due to overall declines in advertising yields from our advertising networks

page views on our network of customer websites increased by  million  or  from  million page views in the year ended december   to  million pages viewed in the year ended december  the increase in page views was due primarily to the acquisition of indieclick on august   which contributed  million page views during the period  growth in publishers utilizing our social media applications and the expansion of our arrangements with customers in which we deploy our content to their websites 
rpms decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  the decrease in rpms was largely due to a mix shift toward lower rpm page views such as indieclick and our social media customers  as well as slight declines in advertising yields from our advertising networks relating to our customers undeveloped websites

registrar revenue registrar revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was largely due to an increase in domains  which were attributable in large part to an increased number of new domain registrations and domain renewal registrations in compared to  as well as an overall increase in our average revenue per domain 
the number of domain registrations increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million in the same period in driven by new partnerships with large domain owners and growth from existing resellers 
our average revenue per domain increased slightly by  or  to during the year ended december  from in the same period in due in part to an increase in value added services revenue as compared to beginning july   the number of net new domains has been adjusted to include only new registered domains added to our platform for which we have recognized revenue

compared to registrar revenue for the year ended december  increased million or  to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was largely due to an increase in domains  due in large part to an increased number of new domain registration and domain renewal registrations in compared to partially offset by a slight decrease in our average revenue per domain 
the number of domain registrations increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million 
our average revenue per domain decreased slightly by  or  to during the year ended december  from in the same period in largely due to a higher mix of volume based domain resellers transferring over their domain registrations in the latter half of as compared to cost and expenses operating costs and expenses were as follows change year ended december  to to in thousands service costs exclusive of amortization of intangible assets sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangible assets service costs compared to service costs for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  to million compared to million in the same period in the increase was largely due to a million increase in domain registry fees associated with our growth in domain registrations and related revenue over the same period  a million increase in content and related costs  a million increase in related information technology expense and a million increase in depreciation expense of technology assets purchased in the prior and current periods required to manage the growth of our internet traffic  data centers  advertising transactions  domain registrations and new products and services and a million increase in personnel and related costs due to increased head count

compared to other income expenses  net for the year ended december  increased by million to million of expense compared to less than million in the same period in the increase in other income expense net during the year ended december  was primarily a result of million of expense increase in the impact of changes in the fair value associated with our preferred warrant outstanding in and income tax benefit provision compared to during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million compared to million during the same period in  representing a million or increase 
the increase was primarily due to the recognition of a full valuation allowance against our state deferred tax assets during our state deferred taxes reached a net deferred tax asset position during  excluding the deferred tax liability for tax deductible goodwill  which is excluded because the ultimate realization of which is uncertain and thus not available to assure the realization of deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance  which increased by million from million during the year ended december  to million in the same period in now applies to both federal and state deferred tax assets 
in addition  the tax increase was also impacted by movement in the company s state tax apportionment rates due to changes in state tax laws and the company s state tax footprint during  partially offset by a one time benefit of million associated with a business acquisition during compared to during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million compared to million during the same period in  representing a million or year over year increase despite no significant changes in our year over year operating losses before income taxes 
the million increase was largely due to a change in our valuation allowance  which increased by million from million during the year ended december   to million in the same period in  primarily as a result of increases in net deferred tax assets  which includes the impact of tax amortization of deductible goodwill  the ultimate realization of which is uncertain and thus not available to assure the realization of deferred tax assets 
in addition  the increase was also due to corresponding movements in state deferred tax balances as a result of changes in state tax laws and the company s state tax apportionment rates during quarterly results of operations the following unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations for the quarters in the years ended december  and  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated annual financial statements  and include  in the opinion of management  all normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the financial information contained in those statements

seasonality of quarterly results in general  internet usage and online commerce and advertising are seasonally strongest in the fourth quarter and generally slower during the summer months 
while we believe that these seasonal trends have affected and will continue to affect our quarterly results  our rapid growth in operations may have overshadowed these effects to date 
we believe that our business may become more seasonal in the future 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of million  which primarily are invested in money market funds  and our million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks

historically  we have principally financed our operations from the issuance of stock  net cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facility

cash used in investing activities has historically been  and is expected to be  significantly impacted by our upfront investments in content and also reflects our ongoing investments in our platform  company infrastructure and equipment for both service offerings and the net sales and purchases of our marketable securities 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced an evaluation of changes to improve our content creation and distribution platform  through a number of initiatives including creating new content formats to meet rapidly changing consumer demand 
such changes may include increasing our investment in premium video and long form content  increasing and expanding distribution of our content to our network of customer websites  and an overall reduction in the volume of shorter form text articles published on ehow 
com 
in the near term  we also anticipate increased expenditures in non algorithmic content such as premium video and longer form or photo centric content designed to further enhance user engagement 
actions to implement such changes are undertaken only to the extent that we believe that their collective impact would improve the consumer experience on our owned and operated websites and or increase the future overall revenue generated from our existing portfolio of media content 
while we assess such improvements to our content creation and distribution platform  we have begun and expect to maintain a reduced level of overall investment in media content when compared to historical levels 
we currently anticipate making investments  including in long lived media content and the new gtld program  of million or more during the year ending december   which amount could fluctuate based on a variety of factors  including our ongoing evaluation of our content and distribution platform  the gtld auction process  and other investment opportunities 
since our inception through december  we also used significant cash to make strategic acquisitions to further grow our business  including those detailed in note business acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
we may make further acquisitions in the future 
we announced a million stock repurchase plan on august  which was further increased on february  to million 
under the plan  the company is authorized to repurchase up to million of its common stock from time to time in open market purchases or in negotiated transactions 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at an average price of per share for an aggregate amount of million 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on various factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  debt covenant requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 
on august   we replaced our previous revolving credit facility by entering into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with a syndicate of commercial banks 
the credit agreement provides for a million  five year revolving credit facility  with the right subject to certain conditions to increase such facility by up to million in the aggregate 
the syndicate of commercial banks under the credit agreement have no obligation to fund any increase in the size of the facility 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default and affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions  including certain financial maintenance covenants such as a maximum total net leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge ratio 
as of december   no principal balance was outstanding and approximately million was available for borrowing under the credit agreement  after deducting the face amount of outstanding standby letters of credit  and we were in compliance with all covenants 
in the future  we may utilize commercial financings  bonds  debentures  lines of credit and term loans with a syndicate of commercial banks or other bank syndicates for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and investing in our intangible assets  platform and technologies 
we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our million revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities or through additional credit facilities to fund our growing operations  invest in content and make potential acquisitions

the syndicate of commercial banks under the credit agreement have no obligation to fund any increase in the size of the facility 
in early  we decided to borrow funds under our then existing revolving credit facility as a result of instability in the financial markets 
during the year ended december   we borrowed million from our credit facility with a syndicate of commercial banks  and used million of these borrowings to pay down promissory notes issued in conjunction with the acquisition of pluck in during the second half of  we paid down million of the million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and during the year ended december  we paid down the remaining million outstanding under our revolving credit facility as we believed our operations were generating sufficient cash flow to support our operating and investing activities at such time and we had sufficient cash on our balance sheet to do so 
from time to time  we expect to receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options in our common stock 
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our common stock relative to the exercise price of such stock options 
to date  proceeds from employee stock option exercises have not been significant 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements

included in operating lease obligations are agreements to lease our primary office space in santa monica  california and other locations under various non cancelable operating leases that expire between january and april we have no debt obligations  other than our million revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  which currently has no borrowings under it 
at december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit for approximately million primarily associated with certain payment arrangements with domain name registries and landlords 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we have made certain indemnities under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
those indemnities include intellectual property indemnities to our customers  indemnities to our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware and indemnifications related to lease agreements 
in addition  certain of our advertiser and distribution partner agreements contain certain indemnification provisions  which are generally consistent with those prevalent in our industry 
we have not incurred significant obligations under indemnification provisions historically  and do not expect to incur significant obligations in the future 
accordingly  we have no recorded liability for any of these indemnities 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks primarily include interest rate  foreign exchange  inflation  and concentration of credit risk 
to reduce and manage these risks  we assess the financial condition of our large advertising network providers  large direct advertisers and their agencies  large registrar resellers and other large customers when we enter into or amend agreements with them and limit credit risk by collecting in advance when possible and setting and adjusting credit limits where we deem appropriate 
in addition  our recent investment strategy has been to invest in high credit quality financial instruments  which are highly liquid  are readily convertible into cash and that mature within three months from the date of purchase 
foreign currency exchange risk while relatively small  we have operations and generate revenue from sources outside the united states 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue being denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally in the euro and british pound sterling and a relatively smaller percentage of our expenses being denominated in such currencies 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings or losses 
foreign currency risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates 
we believe such a change would not currently have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  as our international operations grow  our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater  and we intend to continue to assess our approach to managing this risk 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
concentrations of credit risk as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were maintained primarily with four major us financial institutions and two foreign banks 
we also maintained cash balances with three internet payment processors 
deposits with these institutions at times exceed the federally insured limits  which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk 
historically  we have not experienced any losses related to these balances and believe that there is minimal risk of expected future losses 
however  there can be no assurance that there will not be losses on these deposits 
as of december  and december   one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated accounts receivable balance december  december  google  inc
