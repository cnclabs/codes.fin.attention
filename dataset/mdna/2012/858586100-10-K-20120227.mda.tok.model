the company also guaranteed approximately million of debt owed by spi to a related party of the selling partner 
deferred compensation plans the accounting for the company s deferred compensation plans can cause year over year fluctuations in company profits 
compensation expense results when the values of company common stock and mutual funds held for the plans increase  and compensation income results when the values of company common stock and mutual funds held for the plans decrease 
the pretax effect of all deferred compensation related activities including realized and unrealized gains and losses on the mutual fund assets held to fund the deferred compensation obligations for the years ended december   and  and the statement of income line items in which the effects of the activities were recorded are displayed in the following tables income expense in millions for the year ended december change deferred compensation administrative expense investment income other  net realized unrealized gains losses on investments other  net pretax income effect income expense in millions for the year ended december change deferred compensation administrative expense investment income other  net realized unrealized gains losses on investments other  net pretax income effect see the applicable corporate expenses section of this management s discussion and analysis for details regarding the period to period change in deferred compensation 

table of contents effects of foreign currency translation the company s foreign subsidiaries transact business and report financial results in their respective local currencies 
as a result  foreign subsidiary income statements are translated into us dollars at average foreign exchange rates appropriate for the reporting period 
because foreign exchange rates fluctuate against the us dollar over time  foreign currency translation affects year to year comparisons of financial statement items ie  because foreign exchange rates fluctuate  similar year to year local currency results for a foreign subsidiary may translate into different us dollar results 
the following tables present the effects that foreign currency translation had on the year over year changes in consolidated net sales and various income line items for compared to and compared to year ended increase due to foreign december in millions increase translation net sales gross profit operating income pretax income year ended increase due to foreign december in millions increase translation net sales gross profit operating income pretax income

an increase in us expenses million  largely due to additional staff and salary expenses  was partially offset by lower product registration expenses under europe s registration  evaluation  authorization of chemical substances reach regulation million 
increased expenses for poland million  which reflected a full year of expenses compared to a partial year in  also contributed to the year over year increase 
interest expense  net  for was up million  or percent  between years 
higher average borrowing levels led to the increase 
the rise in the average debt levels was  in part  attributable to working capital requirements that were driven higher by raw material cost inflation 
in addition  in november and june  the company secured million and million of additional long term notes  respectively  to take advantage of low interest rates and support global growth initiatives 
the loss from equity joint ventures  which included results for tiorco for and the results for tiorco and spi for the first three quarters of the amount included spi results for the first half of the year plus part of the third quarter  increased million year over year 
spi s equity income in the prior year was million  which included a million gain related to revaluing the company s original percent interest in spi as part of the acquisition of controlling interest in the entity 
the tiorco joint venture is primarily a cost sharing venture with nalco company now a part of ecolab inc  as the company sells surfactants directly into the enhanced recovery market and the corresponding profit resides in the surfactants segment operating results 
as planned  the equity loss in tiorco increased million year over year 
other  net was million of expense for compared to million of income for investment losses  attributable to the company s deferred compensation and supplemental defined contribution plan mutual fund investments  amounted to million for compared to million of gains for the company reported foreign exchange losses of million versus million of gains in the same period of the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the decrease was primarily attributable to the implementation of a holding company structure that will provide a recurring benefit in lowering the effective tax rate on foreign earnings 
also contributing to the decrease was a non recurring provision in the prior year related to the purchase of an increased ownership in spi and a dividend from the company s subsidiary in colombia 
an increase in us credits also contributed to the lower effective tax rate  but this was offset by the enactment of a higher illinois corporate income tax rate in see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory us federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate

table of contents during the periods covered by this form k  the company was not party to any such off balance sheet arrangements 
environmental and legal matters the company s operations are subject to extensive local  state and federal regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million 
these projects are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which are typically years 
recurring costs associated with the operation and maintenance of facilities for waste treatment and disposal and managing environmental compliance in ongoing operations at the company s manufacturing locations were approximately million for  million for and million for while difficult to project  it is not anticipated that these recurring expenses will increase significantly in the future 
over the years  the company has received requests for information related to or has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at a number of waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under cercla and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
see the critical accounting policies section that follows for a discussion of the company s environmental liabilities accounting policy 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december   the company s accrued liability for such losses  which represents the company s best estimate within the estimated range of possible environmental and legal losses  was million compared to million at december  because the liabilities accrued are estimates  actual amounts could differ from the amounts reported 
during  cash outlays related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in remediation of the soil at the poland subsidiary accounted for most of the year over year change 
a substantial portion of the remediation cost was paid from a purchase price holdback agreed to at the date of the poland site acquisition see the poland manufacturing site discussion in note 
for certain sites  the company has responded to information requests made by federal  state or local government agencies but has received no response confirming or denying the company s stated positions 
as such  estimates of the total costs  or range of possible costs  of remediation  if any  or the company s share of such costs  if any  cannot be determined with respect to these sites 
consequently  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
given the information 
table of contents available  management believes the company has no liability at these sites 
however  in the event of one or more adverse determinations with respect to such sites in any annual or interim period  the effect on the company s cash flows and results of operations for those periods could be material 
based upon the company s present knowledge with respect to its involvement at these sites  the possibility of other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup  and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
see item  legal proceedings  in this form k and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the significant environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites 
climate change legislation based on currently available information  the company does not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation or regulation is reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company sponsors deferred compensation plans that allow management employees to defer receipt of their bonuses and outside directors to defer receipt of their director fees until retirement  departure from the company or as elected by the participant 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices made by the plan participants 
the investment options include company common stock and a limited selection of mutual funds 
the company maintains sufficient shares of treasury stock to cover the equivalent number of shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option 
as a result  the company must periodically purchase its common shares on the open market 
the plans allow for the deferred 
table of contents compensation to grow or decline based on the results of the investment options chosen by the participants 
some plan distributions may be made in cash or company common stock at the election of the participant 
certain plan distributions can only be made in company common stock 
upon retirement or departure from the company  participants receive cash amounts equivalent to the payment date value of the investment choices they have made or company common stock shares equal to the number of share equivalents held in their accounts 
for deferred compensation obligations that may be settled in cash  appreciation in the value of company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan results in additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the value of company stock or the mutual funds result in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
these market price movements may result in significant period to period fluctuations in the company s income 
because the obligations that must be settled only in company common stock are treated as equity instruments  fluctuations in the market price of the underlying company stock do not affect earnings 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represented deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock  the remainder was tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will generally fluctuate in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets related to the deferred compensation plans are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
as allowed by generally accepted accounting principles  the company elected the fair value option for recording the mutual fund investment assets 
therefore  market value changes for the mutual fund investment assets are recorded in the income statement in the same periods that the offsetting changes in the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded 
dividends  capital gains distributed by the mutual funds  unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss in the other  net line of the consolidated statements of income 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within a range of possible costs is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the 
table of contents remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this md a for discussion of the company s recorded liabilities and range of loss estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item  for information on recent accounting pronouncements  which affect the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates globally  its cash flows and operating results are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are recorded in income 
the company uses forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
at december   the company had forward contracts to sell million on behalf of subsidiaries in canada  mexico  and poland 
at year end the company had forward contracts to buy million on behalf of subsidiaries in the netherlands  france  the philippines and germany 
the company had forward contracts to sell eur million and buy eur million on behalf of its subsidiaries in poland and the uk  respectively 
at december  the company had one forward contract to purchase sgd million on behalf of a subsidiary in singapore where the functional currency is the us dollar 
periodically  the company and its subsidiaries issue us dollar and euro denominated trade receivables or loans to each other 
gains and losses on these transactions are included in income 
foreign currency exposures for the company s canadian and european subsidiaries are essentially all covered by forward contracts as noted above 
as of december   the company had net receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
hypothetical 
table of contents fluctuations of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was made up of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on short term variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are recovered from customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent the recovery of cost increases from customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward purchase contracts are used to aid in managing the company s natural gas and electric costs 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of natural gas  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas would cause the company s actual natural gas cost to be million higher or lower than the cost at market price 
also at december   the company had contracts to purchase approximately  megawatt hours of electricity at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of electricity  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of electricity would cause the company s actual electric cost to be million higher or lower than the cost at market price
