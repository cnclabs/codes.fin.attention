item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth the percentage of patient days from various payors in sunlink s healthcare facilities for the periods indicated 
fiscal years ended june  source medicare medicaid private and other sources the following table sets forth the percentage of the net patient revenues from major payors in sunlink s hospitals 
fiscal years ended june  source medicare medicaid private and other sources hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels  the extent to which ancillary services and therapy programs are ordered by physicians and provided to patients  and the volume of outpatient procedures 
reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of service eg  acute care  intensive care or psychiatric care and the geographic location of the hospital 
the percentage of patient revenues attributable to outpatient services has increased in recent years  primarily as a result of medical technology advances that allow more services to be provided on an outpatient basis and from increased pressures from medicare  medicaid and private insurers to reduce hospital stays and provide services  where possible  on a less expensive outpatient basis 
patients generally are not responsible for any difference between established hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid and some private insurer plans  health maintenance organization hmo plans and preferred provider organizations ppo plans  but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has been increasing in recent years 
collection of amounts due from individuals typically is more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
further  amounts received under the medicare and medicaid programs generally are significantly less than the established charges of most hospitals  including our own  for the services provided 
likewise  hmos and ppos generally seek and obtain discounts from the established charges of most hospitals 
see item business government reimbursement programs medicare medicaid reimbursement 

index to financial statements competition among the factors which we believe influence patient selection among hospitals in our markets are the appearance and functionality of the healthcare facilities  the quality and demeanor of professional staff and physicians  and the participation of the hospital in plans which pay a portion of the patient s bill 
such factors are influenced heavily by the quality and scope of medical services  strength of referral networks  hospital location and the price of hospital services 
our hospitals may face less competition in their immediate patient service areas than would be expected in larger communities because they are the primary provider of healthcare services in their respective communities 
however  our hospitals usually face competition from larger tertiary care centers and  in some cases  other rural  exurban  suburban or  in limited circumstances  urban hospitals  some of which offer more specialized services 
the competing hospitals may be owned by governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions and may be able to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis 
such governmental owned and not for profit hospitals  as well as various for profit hospitals operating in the broader service area of our hospitals  likely have greater access to financial resources than do our hospitals 
managed care each sunlink hospital is affected by its ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services 
hmos and ppos attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services through managed care programs 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are seeking to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers on the basis of market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of medical staff  convenience and price 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market  depending on the market strength of such organizations 
management believes that  on an industry basis  managed care contracts generally are less important in our markets than in urban and suburban markets where there is typically a higher level of managed care penetration 
nevertheless  a significant portion of hospital patients in our communities are covered by managed care or other reimbursement programs  all of which generally pay less than established charges for hospital services 
the healthcare industry as a whole faces the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while managing rising costs  facing strong competition for patients  and adjusting to a continued general reduction of reimbursement rates by both private and government payors 
both private and government payors continually seek to reduce the nature and scope of services which may be reimbursed 
healthcare reform at both the federal and state level generally has created pressure to reduce reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations  and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payors  may require changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  rates and or services in the future 
efforts to control healthcare costs the hospital industry  including all of sunlink s hospitals  continues to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and average inpatient occupancy rates continue to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization  utilization review  and payment mechanisms designed to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients and to limit the cost of treating inpatients 
admissions constraints  payor pressures  and increased competition are likely to 
index to financial statements continue 
historically we have responded to such trends by adding and expanding outpatient services  upgrading facilities and equipment  offering new programs and adding or expanding certain inpatient and ancillary services 
currently we expect to continue to respond to such trends in a similar manner subject to the availability of capital resources and our evaluation of the continued utility of such historical responses 
health care reform the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education reconciliation act of collectively  the affordable care act or aca were signed into law by president obama on march   and march   respectively 
the aca alters the united states health care system and is intended to decrease the number of uninsured americans and reduce overall health care costs 
the aca attempts to achieve these goals by  among other things  requiring most americans to obtain health insurance or pay a tax penalty  expanding medicare and medicaid eligibility  reducing medicare and medicaid payments including disproportionate share payments  expanding the medicare program s use of value based purchasing programs  tying hospital payments to the satisfaction of certain quality criteria  and bundling payments to hospitals and other providers 
the aca also contains a number of measures that are intended to reduce fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs  such as requiring the use of recovery audit contractors in the medicaid program and generally prohibiting physician owned hospitals from adding new physician owners or increasing the number of beds and operating rooms for which they are licensed 
because a majority of the measures contained in the aca do not take effect until and and most of the rules and regulations that implement the provisions of the aca have not been adopted or proposed  it is difficult to predict the impact the aca will have on our facilities 
however  it is possible that the implementation or interpretation of such rules and regulations or the provisions of the aca could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
government reimbursement programs a significant portion of sunlink s healthcare facilities net revenues are dependent upon reimbursement from medicare and medicaid 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services or cms is the federal agency which administers medicare  medicaid and the children s health insurance program chip 
although the federal government generally reviews payment rates under its various programs annually  changes in reimbursement rates under such programs  including medicare and medicaid  generally occur based on the fiscal year of the federal government which currently begins on october and ends on september of each year 
medicare inpatient reimbursement the medicare program pays hospitals under the provisions of a prospective payment system for inpatient services 
under the inpatient prospective payment system  a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment  known as diagnosis related groups drgs 
each patient admitted for care is assigned to a drg based upon his or her primary admitting diagnosis 
every drg is assigned a payment rate by the government based upon the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to treat the average patient with that particular diagnosis 
drg payments do not consider a specific hospital s costs  but are national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case mix indices 
drg rates are usually adjusted by an update factor each federal fiscal year ffy 
the percentage increases to drg payment rates for the last several years have been lower than the percentage increases in the related cost of goods and services provided by general hospitals 
the index used to adjust the drg payment rates is based on a price statistic  known as the cms market basket index  reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors 
drg rate increases were and for ffy and  respectively  and currently is for ffy the balanced budget act of originally set the increase in drg payment rates for future ffys at 
index to financial statements rates that would be based on the market basket index  which in certain years have been  and in the future may be  subject to reduction factors 
in ffy the market basket rate currently is affected by two such reduction factors 
first as required by the affordable care act  the market basket rate is reduced by 
second  cms is applying a documentation and coding adjustment to recoup a portion of excess aggregate payments in ffy and fy that did not reflect actual increases in patients severity of illness 
under legislation passed in  cms is required to recoup the entire amount of ffy and excess spending resulting from changes in hospital coding practices no later than ffy if the update factor does not adequately reflect increases in sunlink s cost of providing inpatient services  our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
the aca made a number of changes to medicare which include but are not limited to reduction of market basket updates in medicare payment rates for providers including to incorporate adjustment for expected productivity gains 
the market basket was reduced by for both ffy and  and will be reduced by in ffys and  by in ffy  by in and  and by in ffys reduction of medicare payments that would otherwise be made to hospitals by specified percentages to account for preventable hospital readmissions  effective october  extension of the medicare dependent hospital program until september  expansion  on a temporary basis  of the low volume hospital inpatient payment adjustment to include hospitals that are more than miles from other healthcare facilities and have less than  discharges per year 
the new temporary criteria are effective for ffys and effective ffy and forward  the low volume hospital definition and payment adjustment methodology will return to the pre ffy definition and methodology 
each of sunlink s hospitals is an eligible hospital under one or more provisions of aca 
medicare outpatient reimbursement most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system 
this outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of ambulatory payment classifications apc 
each apc is designed to represent a bundle of outpatient services  and each apc is assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate 
medicare pays a set price or rate for each apc group  regardless of the actual cost incurred in providing care 
each apc rate generally is subject to adjustment each year by an update factor based on a market basket of services index 
for calendar years  and the update factors were  and respectively 
if the update factor does not adequately reflect increases in sunlink s cost of providing outpatient services  our financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected 
medicare bad debt reimbursement under medicare  the costs attributable to the deductible and coinsurance amounts that remain unpaid by medicare beneficiaries can be partially added to the medicare share of allowable costs as cost reports are filed 
hospitals generally receive interim pass through payments during the cost report year which were determined by the respective medicare auditor contractor mac from the prior cost report filing 
bad debts must meet the following criteria to be allowable the debt must be related to covered services and derived from deductible and coinsurance amounts  the provider must be able to establish that reasonable collection efforts were made  the debt was actually uncollectible when claimed as worthless  and sound business judgment established that there was no likelihood of recovery at any time in the future 

index to financial statements amounts uncollectible from specific beneficiaries are charged off as bad debts in the accounting period in which the accounts are deemed to be worthless 
in some cases  an amount previously written off as a bad debt and allocated to the program may be recovered in a subsequent accounting period 
in these cases  the recoveries must be used to reduce the cost of beneficiary services for the period in which the collection is made 
in determining reasonable costs for hospitals  the amount of bad debts otherwise treated as allowable costs is reduced by 
under this program  our hospitals received an aggregate of approximately   and  for  and  respectively 
medicare disproportionate share payments in addition to the standard drg payment  the social security act requires that additional medicare payments be made to hospitals with a disproportionate share of low income patients 
beneficiary improvement and protection act bipa provisions  effective for services provided on and after april   stipulate that rural facilities with fewer than beds with a disproportionate share percentage greater than will be classified as a disproportionate share hospital entitled to receive a supplemental disproportionate share payment based on gross drg payments 
since april   the effective rate has been of drg payments 
all of our hospitals were classified as disproportionate share hospitals at june  furthermore  the affordable care act provides for material reductions in medicare dsh funding 
however  we estimate that medicare disproportionate share payments represented only approximately of our net patient service revenues for the years ended june   and medicaid inpatient and outpatient reimbursement each state operates a medicaid program funded jointly by the state and the federal government 
federal law governs the general management of the medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources 
as a result  each state medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria 
in the recent past  the various states in which sunlink operates hospitals have initiated increased efforts to reduce medicaid assistance payments 
these efforts and reductions often are triggered by one or more of the following factors an increased effort by cms to decrease the federal share of payments for medicaid beneficiaries or significant increases in program utilization resulting from increased enrollment or budgetary pressures on the applicable states 
the federal government s percentage share of each state s medical assistance expenditures under medicaid is determined by a formula specified in medicaid law referred to as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap 
on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra this law provides a temporary increase in the state fmaps during a calendar quarter recession adjustment period retroactively beginning october  and ending december  traditionally under the medicaid law  each state s fmap is determined by a formula based on the relationship of each state s per capita income to the national per capita income  the lower a state s per capita income  the higher its fmap 
the fmap is determined for each fiscal year and applies for states expenditures during that fiscal year 
as a result of the temporary arra increase in the fmap  reductions in medicaid programs which were scheduled to take effect on july  in various states where sunlink operates were postponed until january  the state of georgia  where sunlink operates three hospitals  has begun initiatives to decrease the medicaid funds paid to providers 
georgia medicaid pays providers for inpatient services in a manner similar to the medicare prospective payment system in that hospitals receive a fixed fee for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment  also known as drgs 
these medicaid drg payments do not consider a specific hospital s costs  but are statewide rates adjusted for each hospital s capital cost allotment 

index to financial statements medicaid outpatient services are reimbursed with interim rates based on a facility specific cost to charge ratio 
these interim payments are then adjusted subsequent to the end of the cost reporting period to an amount equal to of the costs associated with providing care to the medicaid outpatient population 
in  georgia implemented a medicaid hmo program and awarded contracts to private companies for the management and processing of certain medicaid claims 
the intent of the medicaid hmo program is to curtail utilization and reduce rates paid by the state of georgia 
all of sunlink s facilities that operate in the state of georgia have secured contracts with all the hmo companies contracted by the state in their respective regions 
since the implementation of the medicaid hmo program  all sunlink hospitals receive reimbursement from three different contractors instead of a single source 
while the amounts of the inpatient payments have not changed since the contractors utilize the same payment rates  the timing of the receipt of the payments has changed due to the multiple payors 
for outpatient services  our hospitals have contracts with the three hmo vendors and services are reimbursed at of the current interim rate as determined by the georgia department of community health 
adoption of electronic health records electronic health records ehr incentive reimbursements are payments received under the health information technology for economic and clinical health act the hitech act which was enacted into law on february  as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
the hitech act includes provisions designed to increase the use of ehr by both physicians and hospitals 
beginning with federal fiscal year federal fiscal year is october through september and extending through federal fiscal year  eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals cah participating in the medicare and medicaid programs are eligible for reimbursement incentives based on successfully demonstrating meaningful use of their certified ehr technology 
conversely  those hospitals that do not successfully demonstrate meaningful use of ehr technology are subject to payment penalties or downward adjustments to their medicare payments beginning in federal fiscal year the company accounts for ehr incentive payments in accordance with asc  gain contingencies asc 
in accordance with asc  the company recognizes a gain for ehr incentive payments when its eligible hospitals have demonstrated meaningful use of certified ehr technology for the applicable period and when the cost report information needed for the full cost report year used for the final calculation of the ehr incentive reimbursement payment is available 
the demonstration of meaningful use is based on meeting a series of objectives and varies among hospitals  between the medicare and medicaid programs  and within the medicaid program from state to state 
additionally  meeting the series of objectives in order to demonstrate meaningful use becomes progressively more stringent as its implementation is phased in through stages as outlined by the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
attestation of medicare meaningful use requirements for the first year october  september  began on april  each of sunlink s five hospitals and memorial and chilton registered for the program with cms and on april  all successfully attested compliance with part i of the medicare ehr incentive program for such first year 
the company received  in ehr medicare incentive reimbursements for the five hospitals and  and for memorial and chilton  respectively  for the company s fiscal year ended june  the company has also successfully attested to the meaningful use requirements for medicaid program for each of its five hospitals and memorial and chilton 
the company recognized medicaid ehr reimbursement for its georgia and missouri hospitals in the amount of  and for memorial and chilton in the amounts of and  respectively  for the fiscal year end june  the company recognized medicaid ehr reimbursement for its mississippi hospital in the amount of for the company s fiscal year ended june  
index to financial statements we intend to continue to comply with the ehr meaningful use requirements of the hitech act in time to qualify for all available incentive payments 
we believe our compliance will result in significant costs including professional services focused on successfully designing and implementing our ehr solutions along with costs associated with the hardware and software components of the project 
as a result of our prior expenditures on information technology systems  our previously existing information technology systems already possessed certain components required for meaningful use of ehr technology 
we continue to refine our budgeted costs and the expected reimbursement associated with our use of ehr technology 
we currently estimate that  at a minimum  the incremental total costs and capital expenditures incurred to comply with the ehr regulations will be recovered through improved reimbursement amounts over the projected lifecycle of our ehr technology initiative  although such incremental costs and capital expenditures  have to a great degree  predated the reimbursements 
government reimbursement program administration and adjustments the medicare  medicaid and tricare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review and changing governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments under such programs 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues  costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due 
providers have rights of appeal and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of prior years cost reports 
although the final outcome of these audits and the nature and amounts of any adjustments are difficult to predict  we believe that we have made adequate provisions in our financial statements for adjustments that may result from these audits and that final resolution of any contested issues should not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
until final adjustment  however  significant issues may remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or greater than ultimately required 
in  cms began using recovery audit contractors racs to detect medicare overpayments not identified through existing claims review mechanisms 
the rac program relies on private companies to examine medicare claims filed by healthcare providers 
the rac program was made permanent by the tax relief and health care act of will gradually roll out in additional states 
the affordable care act expands the rac program s scope to include managed medicare and to include medicaid claims beginning june   and by requiring all states to establish programs to contract with racs in currently all states where sunlink operates have rac programs  and all sunlink facilities have had requests from the various racs to review claims 
to date since the commencement of the rac program sunlink has experienced losses in the aggregate from audit adjustments of approximately racs perform post discharge audits of medical records to identify medicare overpayments resulting from incorrect payment amounts  non covered services  incorrectly coded services  and duplicate services 
cms has given racs the authority to look back at claims up to three years old  provided that the claim was paid on or after october  claims review strategies used by racs generally include a review of high dollar claims  including inpatient hospital claims 
as a result  a large majority of the total amounts recovered by racs has come from hospitals 
claims identified as overpayments will be subject to the medicare appeals process 

index to financial statements racs are paid a contingency fee based on the overpayments they identify and collect 
we expect that the racs will continue to look closely at claims submitted by our facilities in an attempt to identify possible overpayments 
although we believe the claims for reimbursement submitted to the medicare program are accurate  we cannot predict the results of any future rac audits 
in addition  cms employs medicaid integrity contractors mics to perform post payment audits of medicaid claims and identify overpayments 
the affordable care act increases federal funding for the mic program for federal fiscal year and later years 
in addition to racs and mics  the state medicaid agencies and other contractors have also increased their review activities 
if sunlink or any of our facilities were found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or similar programs  the facility and sunlink could be subject to substantial monetary fines  civil penalties and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
specialty pharmacy operations our specialty pharmacy segment is operated through our sunlink scriptsrx  llc subsidiary and is a pharmacy operations segment composed of four material service lines specialty pharmacy services which ordinarily include one or more of the following elements the provision of products relating to infusion therapy  enteral feeding services  oncology and chemotherapy drug administration  cardiac  diabetes  pain management  wound care  and psychiatric services  pharmaceutical or biological products administered via non oral means  which are frequently through injectable or infusion therapies  products delivered to patients via express package or hand delivery and requiring special handling such as constant refrigeration or having an extremely limited shelf life  products that generally are administered in a non hospital setting  including physicians offices  specialty clinics or patient homes  the provision of pharmaceuticals or biological products not managed under traditional outpatient prescription drug benefits  and therapies that require complex care  patient education and continuous monitoring 
the major conditions these drugs treat include  but are not limited to respiratory system weakness  cancer  hiv aids  hemophilia  hepatitis c  multiple sclerosis  infertility  crohn s disease  rheumatoid arthritis  and growth hormone deficiency 
institutional pharmacy services  consisting of the provision of specialty and non specialty pharmaceuticals and biological products to institutional clients or to patients in institutional settings such as nursing homes  hospices  and correctional facilities  durable medical equipment services  consisting primarily of products for patient administered home care such as oxygen concentrator services  continuous positive airway pressure or cpap machines  nebulizers  diabetes management products and prosthetics  retail pharmacy products and services  consisting primarily of walk in sales at our three distribution facilities in louisiana of complementary products including uniforms  non specialty pharmaceuticals  vitamins  supplements and nutritionals 
we view our retail pharmacy operations as a source of incremental revenue to us while providing value added service to our patients in the form of full service pharmacy offerings 

index to financial statements certain of the service lines in our specialty pharmacy segment may overlap with our healthcare operations 
likewise  institutional pharmacy services may overlap with pharmacies in our healthcare facilities 
government reimbursement programs our specialty pharmacy business is subject to certain rules implemented by the medicare modernization act mma and  in the future may be subject to other rules previously implemented by mma with respect to urban providers 
regulations implementing cost containment mandates under mma reduced the reimbursement for healthcare providers in urban areas for a number of products and services which are also provided by our pharmacy operations and established a competitive bidding program for certain durable medical equipment provided under medicare part b in urban areas 
competitive bidding is intended to further reduce reimbursement for certain products and will likely decrease the number of companies permitted to serve medicare beneficiaries in the competitive bidding areas cbas 
cms had planned to implement the competitive bidding program for medicare durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics  and supplies dmepos products and services with the goal of offering beneficiaries access to quality with lower out of pocket costs 
we were exempted under the deficit reduction act of from the proposed competitive acquisition program for dmepos  but we cannot be sure such exemption will continue to be available in the future or that the program  if expanded in the future  would be expanded in its original form 
if the program is expanded in the future  loss of the exemption could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
the program has  however  been deferred indefinitely  and whether or not the program will be implemented in the future is unknown 
the mma also created a medicare prescription drug benefit which began in and a prescription drug card program 
final rules implementing the portions of the mma relating to the new prescription drug benefit were adopted in under mma medicare part b covered drugs and biological products generally are paid based on the average sales price asp methodology 
the asp methodology uses quarterly drug pricing data submitted to the cms by drug manufacturers 
cms will supply contractors with the asp drug pricing files for medicare part b drugs on a quarterly basis 
principal products paid under the asp methodology include certain oncology and renal dialysis drugs 
although  there are exceptions to this general rule which are listed in the latest asp quarterly change request cr document and which exceptions generally are paid on a cost basis  such exceptions have not been and are not expected to be material to our operations 
beginning in january  cms s outpatient prospective payment system began paying for most separately payable medicare part b drugs administered in a hospital outpatient setting at a reimbursement level of asp plus and asp plus in other settings 
such outpatient price represented a decrease from asp 
section d of the mma also requires the implementation of a competitive acquisition program the part b cap for medicare part b drugs and biologicals not paid on a cost or prospective payment system basis 
the part b cap is an alternative to the asp methodology for acquiring certain part b drugs which are administered incident to a physician s services 
currently  the part b cap is a voluntary program that offers physicians the option to acquire many injectable and infused drugs they use in their practice from an approved part b cap vendor  thus reducing the time and cost of buying and billing for drugs 
currently  the cap for part b drugs and biologicals is only for injectable and infused drugs currently billed under part b that are administered in a physician s office  incident to a physician s service 
in late  cms conducted the first round of bidding for approved part b cap vendors 
the part b cap was implemented on july  the cap vendor bidding period concluded on february  cms received several qualified bids  however  contractual issues with the successful bidders resulted in the program being postponed by cms in september as a result  cap drugs were not available from an approved cap vendor for dates of service after december  
index to financial statements at least one medicaid program has adopted  and other medicaid programs  some states and some private payors may be expected to adopt  those aspects of the mma that either result in or appear to result in price reductions for drugs covered by such programs 
adoption of asp as the measure for determining reimbursement by medicare and medicaid programs for additional drugs sold by our specialty pharmacy operations could reduce revenue and gross margins and could materially affect our current average wholesale price awp based reimbursement structure with private payors 
we cannot assure you that the asp reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by our specialty pharmacy operations or that we will be able to operate our specialty pharmacy operations profitably at either existing or at lower reimbursement rates 
likewise  we cannot assure you that the part b cap program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which we operate  or may seek to operate  in particular or that we would be able to meet the qualifications to become a part b cap vendor either now or at any time in the future 
competition there are many companies which provide one or more of the healthcare operations which comprise or may compete with our pharmacy operations 
for example  home healthcare business companies  which may compete with our specialty pharmacy services  our durable medical equipment services operations or both  range in size from small entrepreneurial companies to rapidly expanding companies with strategies for national operations such as amedisys  inc  apria healthcare group  inc  gentiva health services  inc  and walgreen co 
specialty pharmacy companies range from local or regional pharmacies to large public companies such as option care  inc  a subsidiary of walgreen co  cvs caremark corporation  priority healthcare corporation and bioscrip  inc institutional pharmacy companies likewise range from local or regional pharmacies to large public companies including pharmerica corporation and omnicare  inc healthcare regulation overview the healthcare industry is one of the largest industries in the united states and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
there are many factors that are highly significant to the healthcare industry including medicare  medicaid  and other public and private hospital cost containment programs  proposals to limit healthcare spending and proposals to limit prices and increase industry competition 
the healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
there continue to be federal and state proposals that would  and actions that do  impose limitations on government and private payments to providers  including community hospitals 
in addition  there regularly are proposals to increase co payments and deductibles from program and private patients 
hospital facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay 
such controls include what is commonly referred to as utilization review 
utilization review entails the review of a patient s admission and course of treatment by a third party 
historically  utilization review has resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed 
utilization review is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by medicare and medicaid and is also required under many managed care arrangements 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  additional measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
various states have applied  or are considering applying  for a waiver from current medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their medicaid participants through managed care providers 
these proposals also may attempt to include 
index to financial statements coverage for some people who presently are uninsured  and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals  physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under medicaid 
healthcare facility regulation certificate of need requirements a number of states require approval for the purchase  construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
certificates of need cons  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over applicable healthcare facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or the addition of services and certain other matters 
all three states in which sunlink currently operates hospitals georgia  mississippi and missouri have con laws that apply to such facilities 
the two states georgia and mississippi in which sunlink currently operates nursing homes skilled nursing facilities also have con laws that apply to nursing homes and other skilled nursing facilities 
states periodically review  modify and revise their con laws and related regulations 
in addition  future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that require cons 
sunlink is unable to predict whether its healthcare facilities will be able to obtain any cons that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required 
violation of these state laws may result in the imposition of civil sanctions or the revocation of licenses for such facilities 
future healthcare facility acquisitions also may occur in states that do not require cons or which have less stringent con requirements than the states in which sunlink currently operates healthcare facilities 
any healthcare facility operated by sunlink in such states may face increased competition from new or expanding facilities operated by competitors  including physicians 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance sunlink s healthcare facilities are subject to  and comply with  various forms of utilization review 
in addition  under the medicare prospective payment system  each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges in hospitals 
medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility  are overseen by each healthcare facility s local governing board  the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members  and are reviewed by sunlink s quality assurance personnel 
the local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care  develop long range plans  establish  review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
emergency medical treatment and active labor act all of our facilities are subject to the emergency medical treatment and active labor act emtala 
this federal law requires any hospital that participates in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents himself to the hospital s emergency department for treatment and  if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition  to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition 
the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment 
there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay 
penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program  the medicaid program or both 
in addition  an injured patient  the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital 
although we believe that our hospitals comply with emtala  we cannot predict 
index to financial statements whether cms will implement new requirements in the future and whether we will be able to comply with any new requirements 
conversion legislation many states  including some where we have hospitals and others where we may in the future acquire hospitals  have adopted legislation regarding the sale or other disposition of hospitals operated by not for profit entities 
in other states that do not have specific legislation  state attorneys generally have demonstrated an interest in these transactions under their general obligations to protect charitable assets from waste 
these legislative and administrative efforts primarily focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the not for profit seller 
these reviews and  in some instances  approval processes  can add additional time to the closing of a hospital acquisition 
there can be no assurance that future actions on the state level will not seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals 
if these activities are widespread  they could limit our ability to acquire additional hospitals or increase our acquisition costs 
specialty pharmacy segment regulation overview much like our healthcare facility operations  the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations governing their operations including laws and regulations with respect to operation of pharmacies  repackaging of drug products  wholesale distribution  dispensing of controlled substances  cross jurisdictional sale and distribution of pharmacy products  medical waste disposal  clinical trials and non discriminatory access 
federal statutes and regulations govern the labeling  packaging  advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs as well as the dispensing of controlled substances 
federal controlled substance laws require us to register our pharmacies and repackaging facilities with the united states drug enforcement administration dea and to comply with security  recordkeeping  inventory control and labeling standards in order to dispense controlled substances 
although we believe that the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment have obtained the permits and or licenses required to conduct our specialty pharmacy business as currently conducted  a failure to have the necessary permits and licenses could have a material adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business  and our financial condition or results of operations 
mail order activities currently the activities of our hospital pharmacies are ancillary to the operations of the facilities they serve 
in contrast  the operations of our specialty pharmacy services operations are stand alone operations that  in addition to walk in customers  distribute pharmaceuticals through a variety of delivery methods  including by mail and express delivery services 
many states in which we deliver or may seek to deliver pharmaceuticals have laws and regulations that require out of state mail service pharmacies to register with  or be licensed by  the boards of pharmacy or similar regulatory bodies in those states 
these states generally permit the dispensing pharmacy to follow the laws of the state within which the dispensing pharmacy is located 
however  various state medicaid programs have enacted laws and or adopted rules or regulations directed at restricting or prohibiting the operation of out of state pharmacies by  among other things  requiring compliance with all laws of the states into which the out of state pharmacy dispenses medications  whether or not those laws conflict with the laws of the state in which the pharmacy is located  or requiring the pharmacist in charge to be licensed in that state 
to the extent that such laws or regulations are found to be applicable to our operations  we believe our specialty pharmacy operations comply with them in all material respects 
to the extent that any of the foregoing laws or regulations prohibit or restrict the operation of mail service pharmacies and are found to be applicable to our specialty pharmacy operations  they could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our pharmacy operations  which currently are concentrated in louisiana 
a number of state medicaid programs prohibit the participation in such state s medicare program by either out of state retail pharmacies or mail order pharmacies  whether located in state or out of state 

index to financial statements advertising and marketing regulations there are also other statutes and regulations which may affect advertising  marketing and distribution of pharmacy products by our specialty pharmacy services 
the federal trade commission requires mail order sellers of goods generally to engage in truthful advertising  to stock a reasonable supply of the products to be sold  to fill mail orders within days  and to provide clients with refunds when appropriate 
healthcare regulations of general application licensing requirements sunlink s healthcare operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local licensing requirements 
in order to maintain their operating licenses  our healthcare facility operations must comply with strict standards concerning medical care  equipment and hygiene 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
all licenses  provider numbers  and other permits or approvals required to perform our business operations are held by individual subsidiaries of sunlink 
each of our hospital operating subsidiaries operates only a single hospital 
all of sunlink s hospitals  except the leased hospital in dexter  missouri  are fully accredited by the jcaho 
drugs and controlled substances various licenses and permits are required by our healthcare facilities and specialty pharmacy business in order to dispense narcotics and operate pharmacies 
we are required to register our pharmacy operations for permits and or licenses with  and comply with certain operating and security standards of  the united states dea  the food and drug administration  or fda  state boards of pharmacy  state health departments and other state agencies in states where we operate or may seek to operate 
state controlled substance laws require registration and compliance with state pharmacy licensure  registration or permit standards promulgated by the state s pharmacy licensing authority 
such standards often address the qualification of an applicant s personnel  the adequacy of its prescription fulfillment and inventory control practices and the adequacy of its facilities 
in general  pharmacy licenses are renewed annually 
pharmacists and pharmacy technicians employed at each of our dispensing locations must also satisfy applicable state licensing requirements 
fraud and abuse  anti kickback and self referral regulations participation in the medicare and or medicaid programs is heavily regulated by federal statutes and regulations 
if a hospital fails to comply substantially with the numerous federal laws governing a facility s activities  the hospital s participation in the medicare and or medicaid programs may be terminated and or civil or criminal penalties may be imposed 
for example  a hospital may lose its ability to participate in the medicare and or medicaid programs if it makes claims to medicare and or medicaid for services not provided or misrepresents actual services provided in order to obtain higher payments  pays money to induce the referral of patients or the purchase of items or services where such items or services are reimbursable under a federal or state health program  fails to report or repay improper or excess payments  or fails to provide appropriate emergency medical screening services to any individual who comes to a hospital s campus or otherwise fails to properly treat and transfer emergency patients 
hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the office of the inspector general oig of the united states and other governmental fraud and abuse programs 
in january  the oig issued supplemental 
index to financial statements compliance program guidance for hospitals that focuses on hospital compliance risk areas 
some of the risk areas highlighted by the oig include correct outpatient procedure coding  revising admission and discharge policies to reflect current cms rules  submitting appropriate claims for supplemental payments such as pass through costs and outlier payments and a general discussion of the fraud and abuse risks related to financial relationships with referral sources 
each federal fiscal year  the oig also publishes a general work plan that provides a brief description of the activities that the oig plans to initiate or continue with respect to the programs and operations of department of health and human services hhs and details the areas that the oig believes are prone to fraud and abuse 
sections of the anti fraud and abuse amendments to the social security act  commonly known as the anti kickback statute  prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  tricare or other healthcare programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by medicare or other government programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
pursuant to the medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of  hhs issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti kickback statute 
a given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal  however  business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal statutes that are not related to receipt of payments from a federal healthcare program 
hipaa created civil penalties for proscribed conduct  including upcoding and billing for medically unnecessary goods or services 
these laws cover all health insurance programs  private as well as governmental 
in addition  hipaa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws  such as the anti kickback statute  to include not just medicare and medicaid services  but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program 
finally  hipaa established enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse 
these mechanisms include a bounty system where a portion of the payment recovered is returned to the government agencies  as well as a whistleblower program  where a portion of the payment received is paid to the whistleblower 
hipaa also expanded the categories of persons that may be excluded from participation in federal and state healthcare programs 
there is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities  the oig  the courts and the us congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and opportunities 
investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
enforcement actions have increased  as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements 
certain exceptions are available for employment agreements  leases  physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements 
a person making a referral  or seeking payment for services referred  in violation of the stark act is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to for each service  restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims  and or exclusion from future participation in the medicare program  which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs 
further  if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity  and 
index to financial statements the physician directly makes referrals to such entity  then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty of up to in addition  the monitoring of compliance with and the enforcing of penalties for violations of these laws and regulations is changing and increasing 
for example  in  cms issued a self referral disclosure protocol for hospitals and other providers that wish to self disclose potential violations of the stark act and attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute 
in light of the provisions of the affordable care act that created potential liabilities under the federal false claims act discussed below for failing to report and repay known overpayments and return an overpayment within sixty days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due  whichever is later  hospitals and other healthcare providers are encouraged to disclose potential violations of the stark act to cms 
it is likely that self disclosure of stark violations will increase in the future 
finally  many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals  some of which extend beyond the medicaid program  to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws the federal false claims act prohibits providers from  among other things  knowingly submitting false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government 
the false claims act defines the term knowingly broadly  and while simple negligence generally will not give rise to liability  submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity can constitute the knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim for the purposes of the false claims act 
the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the false claims act allow private individuals to bring actions under the false claims act on behalf of the government 
these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government  and  as a result  the number of whistleblower lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years 
when a private party brings a qui tam action under the false claims act  the defendant will generally not be aware of the lawsuit until the government makes a determination whether it will intervene and take a lead in the litigation 
if a provider is found to be liable under the false claims act  the provider may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties of between to for each separate false claim 
the government has used the false claims act to prosecute medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors  billing for services not provided  submitting false cost reports  and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality 
hipaa transaction  privacy and security requirements hipaa and federal regulations issued pursuant to hipaa contain  among other measures  provisions that have required us to implement modified or new computer systems  employee training programs and business procedures 
the federal regulations are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry  provide for the confidentiality and privacy of patient healthcare information and ensure the security of healthcare information 
a violation of the hipaa regulations could result in civil money penalties of per incident  up to a maximum of per person  per year  per standard violated 
hipaa also provides for criminal penalties of up to and one year in prison for knowingly and improperly obtaining or disclosing protected health information  up to and five years in prison for obtaining protected health information under false pretenses and up to and ten years in prison for obtaining or disclosing protected health information with the intent to sell  transfer or use such information for commercial advantage  personal gain or malicious harm 
since there is no significant history of enforcement efforts by the federal government at this time  it is not possible to ascertain the likelihood of enforcement efforts in connection with the hipaa regulations or the potential for fines and penalties  which may result from any violation of the regulations 
hipaa privacy regulations hipaa privacy regulations protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
the regulations provide increased patient control over medical records  mandate substantial financial penalties for 
index to financial statements violation of a patient s right to privacy and  with a few exceptions  require that an individual s individually identifiable health information only be used for healthcare related purposes 
these privacy standards apply to all health plans  all healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers  such as our facilities  that transmit health information in an electronic form in connection with standard transactions  and apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form 
these standards impose extensive administrative requirements on our facilities and require compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of such health information  and they require our facilities to impose these rules  by contract  on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on behalf of our facilities 
in addition  our facilities are subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under hipaa 
these laws vary by state and could impose stricter standards and additional penalties 
the hipaa privacy regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations and standards 
under the direction of sunlink s vice president  technical and compliance services  and in conjunction with a private hipaa consultant and hipaa coordinators at each facility  individually tailored policies and procedures were developed and implemented and hipaa privacy educational programs were presented to all employees and physicians at each facility prior to the compliance deadline 
we believe we are in compliance with current hipaa privacy regulations 
hipaa electronic data standards the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange 
these provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
among other things  these provisions require healthcare facilities to use standard data formats and code sets established by hhs when electronically transmitting information in connection with certain transactions  including health claims and equivalent encounter information  healthcare payment and remittance advice and health claim status 
the hhs regulations establish electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions 
the uniform data transmission standards are designed to enable healthcare providers to exchange billing and payment information directly with the many payors thereby eliminating data clearinghouses and simplifying the interface programs necessary to perform this function 
we believe that the management information systems at our facilities and at our corporate headquarters comply with hipaa s electronic data regulations and standards 
hipaa security standards the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of a series of security standards for the protection of electronic health information 
the hipaa security standards rule specifies a series of administrative  technical and physical security procedures for covered entities to use to assure the confidentiality of electronic protected health information 
the standards are delineated into either required or addressable implementation specifications 
under the direction of sunlink s vice president  technical and compliance services  and in conjunction with a consortium of rural hospitals  private hipaa security consultants and hipaa security officers at each facility  we have performed security assessments  and implemented individually tailored plans to apply required or addressable solutions and implemented a set of security policies and procedures 
in addition  we developed and adopted an individually tailored comprehensive disaster contingency plan for each facility and presented a hipaa security training program to all applicable personnel 
sunlink believes it is in full compliance with all aspects of the hipaa security regulations 
hipaa national provider identifier hipaa also required hhs to issue regulations establishing standard unique health identifiers for individuals  employers  health plans and healthcare providers to be used in connection with standard electronic 
index to financial statements transactions 
all healthcare providers  including our facilities  were required to obtain a new national provider identifier npi to be used in standard transactions instead of other numerical identifiers by may  our facilities have fully implemented use of a standard unique healthcare identifier by utilizing their employer identification number 
hhs has not yet issued proposed rules that establish the standard for unique health identifiers for health plans or individuals 
once these regulations are issued in final form  we expect to have approximately one to two years to become fully compliant  but cannot predict the impact of such changes at this time 
we cannot predict whether our facilities may experience payment delays during the transition to the new identifiers 
hhs is currently working on the standards for identifiers for health plans  however  there are currently no proposed timelines for issuance of proposed or final rules 
the issuance of proposed rules for individuals is on hold indefinitely 
icd coding system the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically 
these provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
hhs has issued regulations implementing the hipaa administrative simplification provisions and compliance with these regulations is mandatory for our facilities 
in january  cms published a final rule regarding updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as icd code sets and related changes to the formats used for certain electronic transactions 
while use of the icd code sets is not mandatory until october   we will be modifying our payment systems and processes to prepare for the implementation 
the icd code sets will require significant administrative changes  but we believe that the cost of compliance with these regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our cash flows  financial position or results of operations 
the health reform law requires hhs to adopt standards for additional electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction 
medical waste regulations our operations  especially our healthcare facility operations  generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations are also generally subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
such compliance costs are not significant and we do not anticipate that such compliance costs will be significant in the future 
sunlink operations regulatory compliance program sunlink maintains a company wide compliance program under the direction of our director of risk management 
sunlink s compliance program is directed at all areas of regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement and cost reporting practices  as well as pharmacy and home healthcare operations 
each hospital designates a compliance officer and develops plans to correct problems should they arise 
in addition  all employees are provided with a copy of and given an introduction to sunlink s code of conduct  which includes ethical and compliance guidelines and instructions about the proper resources to utilize in order to address any concerns that may arise 
each hospital conducts annual training to re emphasize sunlink s code of conduct 
we monitor our corporate compliance program to respond to developments in healthcare regulations and the industry 
sunlink also maintains a toll free hotline to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis 
professional liability as part of our business  we are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of operations 
to cover a portion of these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and 
index to financial statements general liability insurance in amounts  which are commercially available  that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
in connection with the acquisition of our initial six community hospitals  sunlink assumed responsibility for general and professional liability claims reported after february  our acquisition date of such hospitals  and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims 
we have purchased claims made commercial insurance with a substantial self insured retention for coverage prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for general and professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february  and for claims incurred after february  in connection with the acquisition of healthmont and its two hospitals  sunlink assumed responsibility for all professional liability claims 
healthmont had purchased claims made commercial insurance for claims made prior to the acquisition 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of liability for claims assumed at the acquisition and for claims incurred after the acquisition 
these estimates are based on actuarially determined amounts 
environmental regulation we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal  state and local environmental regulations 
to date  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial condition or competitive position 
similarly  we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations

item a 
risk factors in addition to other information contained in this annual report  including certain cautionary and forward looking statements  you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating an investment in sunlink consolidated operations risks we may not be able to obtain a replacement for our existing credit facility 
sunlink s primary credit agreement termination date is january  under the agreement  the company s term loan and revolving loan of the credit facility has a balance of and  as of september   respectively 
we are seeking to refinance the remaining unpaid balance of the credit facility with a new lender 
although  we believe the company will be able to refinance existing borrowings under one or more replacement loan facilities either on a company wide or individual facility basis  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing in the amount needed on improved or comparable terms or at all 
although we believe that the company should be able to continue in compliance with the financial covenants in our credit facility  through the termination date  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
our ability to make the required debt service and interest payments under the credit facility depends on  among other things  our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt service commitments or are unable to refinance or restructure our indebtedness prior to maturity at january   such failure could have material adverse effects on the company 
if our operating results continue to decline  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our liquidity needs 
we rely upon cash on hand  cash from operations and a revolving loan facility to fund our cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  commitments and payments of principal and interest on borrowings 
our ability to generate cash from operations has been negatively impacted by uncollectible self pay net revenues of our healthcare facilities segment  increased salary expenses for employed physicians and decreased patient volume at our facilities as a result of economic conditions in the locations we serve as well as decreased sales volume and earning experienced by our specialty pharmacy segment 
we expect that these factors will continue to have a negative impact on our business for the foreseeable future 
further deterioration would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to maintain compliance with or borrow under out existing credit facility 
we currently have borrowing capacity under the revolving portion of the credit facility but there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants 
if non compliance occurs  we may have no ability to borrow funds under the revolving portion of the credit facility 
if we are unable to borrow under our existing credit facility or obtain alternative financing such failure could have a material adverse effect on the company 
sunlink may require additional debt or equity capital in order to make significant capital investments or expand our operations and the inability to make significant capital investments or expand our operations may negatively affect sunlink s competitive position  reduce earnings  and negatively affect our results of operations 
sunlink s operational and growth plans require significant capital investments 
significant capital investments are required for on going and planned capital improvements at existing hospitals and may be required in connection with future capital projects either in connection with existing properties or future acquired properties 
sunlink s ability to make capital investments depends on numerous factors such as the availability of 
index to financial statements funds from operations and its credit facility and access to additional debt and equity financing 
no assurance can be given that the necessary funds will be available 
moreover  incurrence of additional debt financing  if available  may involve additional restrictive covenants that could negatively affect sunlink s ability to operate its business in the desired manner  and raising additional equity may be dilutive to shareholders 
the failure to obtain funds necessary for the realization of sunlink s plans could prevent sunlink from realizing its strategies and  in particular  could force sunlink to forego opportunities that may arise in the future 
this could  in turn  have a negative impact on sunlink s competitive position 
sunlink s revenues are heavily concentrated in the state of georgia which makes sunlink particularly sensitive to economic and other changes in georgia 
for the fiscal year ended june   our two georgia hospitals generated approximately of consolidated gross revenues for the year 
accordingly  any adverse change in the current demographic  economic  competitive or regulatory conditions in the state of georgia could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects of sunlink 
sunlink depends heavily on its management personnel and the loss of the services of one or more of sunlink s key senior management personnel could weaken sunlink s management team 
sunlink has been  and will continue to be  dependent upon the services and management experience of its executive officers 
if any of sunlink s executive officers were to resign their positions or otherwise be unable to serve  sunlink s management could be weakened and operating results could be adversely affected  however  to our knowledge  no key executive personnel intend to retire or terminate their employment with sunlink in the near future 
sunlink conducts business in a heavily regulated industry  changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce revenue and profitability 
the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to licensure  conduct of operations including patient referrals  physician recruiting practices  cost reporting and billing practices  ownership of facilities  addition of facilities and services  confidentiality  maintenance  and security issues associated with medical records  billing for services  and prices for services 
these laws and regulations are extremely complex and  in many instances  the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations  including in particular  medicare and medicaid anti fraud and abuse amendments  codified in section b b of the social security act and known as the anti kickback statute 
this law prohibits providers and others from soliciting  receiving  offering or paying  directly or indirectly  any remuneration with the intent to generate referrals of orders for services or items reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  and other federal healthcare programs 
hhs regulations describe some of the conduct and business relationships immune from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
the fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these safe harbor provisions does not render the arrangement illegal 
however  business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria risk increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 

index to financial statements we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals 
we have contracts with physicians providing services under a variety of financial arrangements such as employment contracts and professional service agreements 
we also provide financial incentives  including loans and minimum revenue guarantees  to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals 
hipaa broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws to include all healthcare services  whether or not they are reimbursed under a federal program 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services in which the physicians or their immediate family members have an ownership interest or certain other financial arrangements 
in addition  sunlink s facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under hipaa  which vary by state and could impose additional penalties 
in recent years  both federal and state government agencies have announced plans for or implemented heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts 
government officials charged with responsibility for enforcing healthcare laws could assert that sunlink or any of the transactions in which the company or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved  are in violation of these laws 
it is also possible that these laws ultimately could be interpreted by the courts in a manner that is different from the interpretations made by the company or others 
a determination that either sunlink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved in a transaction that violated these laws  or the public announcement that sunlink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is being investigated for possible violations of these laws  could have a material adverse effect on sunlink s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects and sunlink s business reputation could suffer significantly 
the laws  rules  and regulations described above are complex and subject to interpretation 
in the event of a determination that we are in violation of any of these laws  rules or regulations  or if further changes in the regulatory framework occur  our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
sunlink is and in the future could be subject to claims related to discontinued operations  including discontinued healthcare operations 
over the past years  sunlink has discontinued operations carried on by its former industrial and life sciences and engineering segments  and uk child safety segments  leisure marine  and housewares segments as well as certain of our healthcare operations 
sunlink currently does not purchase insurance policies to reduce product liability or other discontinued operations exposures and does not anticipate it will purchase such insurance in the future 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  management has not reserved any amounts for contingencies related to the discontinued operations 
the industry trend towards value based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues 
there is a trend in the healthcare industry toward value based purchasing of healthcare services 
these value based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities 
governmental programs including medicare and medicaid currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates 
in addition  medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events 
many large commercial payors currently require hospitals to report quality data  and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events 
the affordable care act contains a number of provisions intended to promote value based purchasing 
effective july   the affordable care act prohibits the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions hacs 
an hac is a 
index to financial statements condition that is acquired by a patient while admitted as an inpatient at a hospital  such as a surgical site infection 
beginning in federal fiscal year  hospitals that fall into the top of national risk adjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a reduction in their total medicare payments 
hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by hhs will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges  not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard 
the affordable care act also requires hhs to implement a value based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services 
the affordable care act requires hhs to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at in federal fiscal year and increasing by each fiscal year up to in federal fiscal year and subsequent years 
hhs will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by hhs 
hhs will determine the amount each hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions 
we expect value based purchasing programs  including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures  to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts 
we are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations  but it could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations 
the lingering effects of the economic recession could materially adversely affect our cash flows  financial position  or results of operations 
the united states economy recently experienced a major economic recession  the economy remains weak  unemployment levels remain high  and there is a substantial risk that the economy will lapse back into recession 
while certain healthcare spending is considered non discretionary and may not be significantly impacted by economic downturns  other types of healthcare spending may be adversely impacted by such conditions 
when patients are experiencing personal financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions  they may choose to defer or forego elective surgeries and other non emergent procedures  which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals  or a high deductible insurance plan or no insurance at all  which increases a hospital s dependence on self pay revenue 
moreover  a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms 
we believe the economic recession has had an adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  although we are unable to quantify the specific impact of continued adverse economic conditions on our business  we believe that the lingering effects of the economic recession have had an adverse impact on our operations 
such impacts can be expected to continue to impact not only the healthcare decisions of our patients and potential patients and could also have an adverse impact on the solvency of certain managed care providers and other counterparties to transactions with us 
sunlink is subject to potential claims for professional liability  including claims based on the acts or omissions of third parties  which claims may not be covered by insurance 
sunlink is subject to potential claims for professional liability medical malpractice in connection with our current operations  as well as potentially acquired or discontinued operations 
to cover such claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
the assertion of a significant number of claims  either within our self insured retention deductible or individually or in the aggregate in excess of available insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
premiums for professional liability insurance have historically been volatile and we cannot assure you that professional liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the 
index to financial statements operations of our hospitals also depend on the professional services of physicians and other trained healthcare providers and technicians in the conduct of their respective operations  including independent laboratories and physicians rendering diagnostic and medical services 
there can be no assurance that any legal action stemming from the act or omission of a third party provider of healthcare services  would not be brought against one of our hospitals or sunlink  resulting in significant legal expenses in order to defend against such legal action or to obtain a financial contribution from the third party whose acts or omissions occasioned the legal action 
risks related to our healthcare facility operations sunlink s success depends on its ability to maintain good relationships with the physicians at its hospitals and  if sunlink is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  admissions and outpatient revenues at sunlink hospitals may decrease and sunlink s operating performance could decline 
because physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and outpatient services  sunlink s success is  in part  dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on the medical staffs of its hospitals  the admissions and referrals practices of the physicians at our hospitals  and our ability to maintain good relations with our physicians 
many physicians at sunlink hospitals are not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and  in many of the markets that sunlink serves  most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to sunlink s hospitals 
if sunlink is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians  admissions at sunlink hospitals may decrease and sunlink s operating performance could decline 
sunlink depends heavily on its healthcare facility management personnel and the loss of the services of one or more of sunlink s key local management personnel could weaken sunlink s management team and its ability to deliver healthcare services 
sunlink s success depends on its ability to attract and retain managers at its hospitals and related health care facilities  on the ability of hospital based officers and key employees to manage growth successfully  and on their ability to attract and retain skilled employees 
sunlink has not had any material difficulties in attracting healthcare facility management  however  if sunlink is unable to attract and retain affective local management  the operating performance of our facilities could decline 
sunlink s success depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals and a shortage of qualified healthcare professionals in certain markets could weaken our ability to deliver healthcare services 
in addition to the physicians and management personnel whom sunlink employs  sunlink s operations are dependent on the efforts  ability  and experience of other healthcare professionals  such as nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians 
nurses  pharmacists  lab technicians and other healthcare professionals are generally employees of each individual sunlink hospital 
sunlink s success has been  and will continue to be  influenced by its ability to attract and retain these skilled employees 
a shortage of healthcare professionals in certain markets  the loss of some or all of its key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could cause sunlink s operating performance to decline 
a significant portion of sunlink s revenue is dependent on medicare and medicaid payments  and possible reductions in medicare or medicaid payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues 
a significant portion of sunlink s revenues are derived from the medicare and medicaid programs  which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
sunlink derived approximately of its patient days and of its net patient revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs for the year ended june  previous legislative changes have resulted in  and future legislative changes may result in  limitations on and reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs 

index to financial statements future healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on sunlink s business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
revenue and profitability of our healthcare facility operations  especially our community hospital operations  may be constrained by future cost containment initiatives undertaken by purchasers of healthcare services if sunlink is unable to contain costs 
our hospitals have been affected by the increasing number of initiatives undertaken during the past several years by all major purchasers of healthcare  including in addition to federal and state governments insurance companies and employers  to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare expenditures in order to contain healthcare costs 
our community hospital operations derived approximately of their net patient revenues for the fiscal year ended june  from private payors and other non governmental sources who contributed approximately of sunlink s patient days 
initiatives such as managed care organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services packages have adversely affected hospital revenue growth throughout the country and such packages represent an increasing portion of sunlink s admissions and outpatient revenues and have resulted in reduced revenue growth at our hospitals 
in addition  private payers increasingly are attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis  increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations  referred to as ppos 
if we are unable to contain costs  especially in our hospital operations  through increased operational efficiencies and the trend toward declining reimbursements and payments continues  the results of healthcare facility segment operations and cash flow will be adversely affected and the results of our consolidated operations and our consolidated cash flow similarly likely would be adversely affected 
our healthcare facilities  especially our community hospitals  face intense competition from other hospitals and healthcare providers which directly affect our segment and consolidated revenues and profitability 
although each of our hospitals operates in communities where they are currently the only general  acute care hospital  they do face competition from other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers 
although these competing hospitals may be as far as to miles away  patients in these markets may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals  managed care plan incentives or personal choice 
the healthcare business is highly competitive and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
each of our hospitals operates in geographic areas where they compete with at least one other hospital that provides services comparable to those offered by our hospitals 
some of these competing facilities offer services  including extensive medical research and medical education programs  which are not offered by sunlink s facilities 
some of the competing hospitals are owned or operated by tax supported governmental bodies or by private not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions which can finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis and are exempt from sales  property  and income taxes 
in some of these markets  sunlink s hospitals also face competition from other for profit hospital companies  some of which have substantially greater resources  as well as other providers such as outpatient surgery and diagnostic centers 
the intense competition from other hospitals and other healthcare providers directly affects the market share of our community hospitals  as well as their and our revenues and profitability 
changes in market demographics may increase competition for certain of our community hospitals 
some of our hospitals are located in exurban areas which are becoming more suburban or metropolitan 
such markets are likely to attract additional competitors  including satellite operations of tertiary hospitals 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to fund capital improvements to our existing facilities  
index to financial statements which may face additional competition or that even if financial resources are available to us  projected operating results will justify such expenditures 
an inability to fund or the infeasibility of funding capital improvements could directly or indirectly have an adverse impact on hospital revenues through lower patient utilization  increased difficulty in physician recruitment and otherwise as a result of increased competition 
sunlink s hospitals are and our other healthcare facilities may be subject to  and depend on  certificate of need laws which could affect their ability to operate profitably 
all states in which sunlink currently operates hospitals and nursing homes have laws requiring approval for the purchase  construction or expansion of various healthcare facilities including hospitals  nursing homes and ambulatory surgery centers and the provision of various services 
under such certificate of need laws  prior state approval is required for the acquisition of major medical equipment or the purchase  lease  construction  expansion  sale or closure of covered healthcare facilities  based on a determination of need for additional or expanded facilities or services 
the required approval is known generally as a certificate of need con 
a con may be required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in hospital and nursing home bed capacity or services  and certain other matters 
the failure to obtain any required con may impair sunlink s ability to operate profitably 
in addition  the elimination or modification of con laws in states in which sunlink operates or in the future may own hospitals and other covered healthcare facilities could subject our hospitals to greater competition making it more difficult to operate profitably 
if we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems and transition to the icd coding system  our operations could be adversely affected 
as required by arra  hhs has adopted an incentive payment program for eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals that implement certified ehr technology and use it consistently with meaningful use requirements 
if our hospitals and employed or contracted professionals do not meet the medicare or medicaid ehr incentive program requirements  we will not receive medicare or medicaid incentive payments to offset some of the costs of implementing the ehr systems 
further  beginning in federal fiscal year  eligible hospitals and physicians that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified ehr technology will be subject to reduced payments from medicare 
failure to implement ehr systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material  adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
health plans and providers  including our hospitals  are required to transition to the new icd coding system  which greatly expands the number and detail of billing codes used for inpatient claims 
under current regulations  use of the icd system is required beginning october  transition to the new icd system requires significant investment in coding technology and software as well as the training of staff involved in the coding and billing process 
in addition to these upfront costs of transition to icd  it is possible that our hospitals could experience disruption or delays in payment due to technical or coding errors or other implementation issues involving our systems or the systems and implementation efforts of health plans and their business partners 
risk relating to our specialty pharmacy business the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment may be adversely affected by changes in government reimbursement regulations and payment levels 
for the year ended june   the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment derived approximately of its net revenues from government payors  principally medicare and medicaid 
the deficit reduction act of exempted rural providers of home care related services from the competitive acquisition program to which urban providers are subject 

index to financial statements we cannot assure you that the asp reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment or that we will continue to be able to operate our specialty pharmacy segment profitably at either existing or at lower reimbursement rates 
likewise  we cannot assure you that the part b cap program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which we operate  or may seek to operate  in particular or that we would be able to meet the qualifications to become a part b cap vendor either now or at any time in the future 
the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment could be harmed by further changes in government purchasing methodologies and reimbursement rates for medicare or medicaid 
in addition to the impact of mma implemented or inspired changes  in order to deal with budget shortfalls  some states are attempting to create state administered prescription drug discount plans  to limit the number of prescriptions per person that are covered  and to raise medicaid co pays and deductibles  and are proposing more restrictive formularies and reductions in pharmacy reimbursement rates 
any reductions in amounts reimbursable by other government programs for our services or changes in regulations governing such reimbursements could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our durable medical equipment service line may be adversely affected by changes in government reimbursement regulations and payment levels  especially if our durable medical equipment service line becomes subject to competitive bidding procedures 
although we are currently exempted under the deficit reduction act of from the competitive acquisition program for dmepos  we cannot be sure such exemption will continue to be available in the future 
loss of such exemption could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment depend on a continuous supply of key products 
any shortages of key products could adversely affect our business 
many of the biopharmaceutical products distributed by the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages 
in addition  the manufacturers of these products may not have adequate manufacturing capability to meet rising demand 
if any products we distribute are in short supply for long periods of time  this could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment are highly dependent on relationships with key suppliers and the loss of any of such key suppliers could adversely affect our business 
any termination of  or adverse change in  our relationships with our key suppliers  or the loss of supply of one of our key products for any other reason  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the largest supplier for our specialty pharmacy operations accounted for approximately of carmichael s total net sales in the fiscal year ended june  our specialty pharmacy operations have a single source of supply for many of our key products  including one product which accounted for approximately of carmichael s total net sales in the fiscal year ended june  in addition  we have few long term contracts with our suppliers 
our arrangements with most of our suppliers may be canceled by either party  without cause  on minimal notice 
many of these arrangements are not governed by written agreements 
the loss of one or more of our larger institutional pharmacy customers could hurt our business by reducing the revenues and profitability of the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment 
as is customary in the institutional pharmacy industry  our specialty pharmacy segment generally does not have long term contracts with our institutional pharmacy customers 
significant declines in the level of purchases by one or more of our larger institutional pharmacy customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

index to financial statements our failure to maintain eligibility as a medicare and medicaid supplier could materially adversely affect our competitive position 
likewise  our failure to maintain and expand relationships with private payors  who can effectively determine the pharmacy source for their members  could materially adversely affect our competitive position 
changes in average wholesale prices could reduce our pricing and margins 
many government payors  including medicare and medicaid  have paid  or continue to pay  the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment directly or indirectly at a rate based upon a drug s awp less a percentage factor 
we also have contracted with some private payors to sell drugs at awp or at awp less a percentage factor 
for most drugs  awp is compiled and published by several private companies  including first databank  inc several states have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers for allegedly inflating reported awp for prescription drugs 
in addition  class action lawsuits have been brought by consumers against pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging overstatement of awp 
we are not responsible for such calculations  reports or payments  however  there can be no assurance that the ability of our specialty pharmacy segment to negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers will not be materially adversely affected by such investigations or lawsuits 
the federal government also has entered into settlement agreements with several drug manufacturers relating to the calculation and reporting of awp pursuant to which the drug manufacturers  among other things  have agreed to report new pricing information  the average sales price  to government healthcare programs 
the average sales price is calculated differently than awp 
we face numerous competitors and potential competitors in the market in which our specialty pharmacy segment operates  many of whom are significantly larger and who have significantly greater financial resources 
although we believe market penetration by large national companies into our existing market in which our specialty pharmacy segment operates has not been substantial  we cannot assure you that one or more of such companies or other healthcare companies will not seek to compete or intensify their level of competition in the areas in which we conduct or may seek to conduct one or more of the components of the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment 
the operations of our specialty pharmacy segment may be adversely affected by industry trends in managed care contracting and consolidation 
a growing number of health plans are contracting with a single provider of specialty pharmacy services 
likewise  manufacturers may not be eager to contract with regional providers of specialty pharmacy services 
if we are unable to obtain managed care contracts in the areas in which we provide specialty pharmacy services or are unable to obtain specialty pharmacy products at reasonable costs or at all  the business operations of our specialty pharmacy segment could be adversely affected 
the specialty pharmacy market may grow slower than expected  which could adversely affect our revenues 
we cannot predict the rate of actual future growth in product availability and spending  the extent to which patient demand or spending for specialty drug services in rural or exurban areas will match national averages or whether government payors will provide reimbursement for new products under medicare or medicare on a timely basis  at what rates or at all  or 
adverse developments in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on the business operations of our specialty pharmacy segment 

index to financial statements other risks sunlink may issue additional equity in the future which could dilute the value of shares of existing shareholders 
the primary sources of sunlink s working capital are cash generated from operations and borrowings available under the revolving loan facility in our current credit facility a  revolving loan with  of the revolver outstanding and approximately available to borrow at june  and with  of the revolver outstanding and approximately  available to borrow at september  
we believe our ability to incur additional indebtedness is limited and we expect that the vast majority of the proceeds of any new borrowings would replace indebtedness under our current credit facility 
our ability to raise additional equity capital may also be limited 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the private placement before august  of a total of up to  of the company s common shares at a price equal to the average closing price for the prior ten trading days on which the company s shares traded with a minimum placement of  on july   sunlink announced the sale of approximately  common shares at per share with certain of its officers and directors and or their affiliates 
the net proceeds of the private placement of approximately  were used  together with the company s operating funds  to make an  pre payment on the credit facility term loan 
a special committee of the company s board of directors comprised of disinterested directors evaluated the private placement transaction and obtained an opinion of an outside advisor selected by the special committee that the price and terms of the private placement were fair from a financial point of view to the company 
no additional shares were sold pursuant to the private placement 
although the board of directors has not decided to effect any additional equity transactions at this time  it may authorize the company to do so in the future in connection with mergers and acquisitions  capital transactions or for other purposes 
any additional equity transactions could result in dilution in the value of existing shares

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings or financial condition 
the table of critical accounting estimates that follows is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june   the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

index to financial statements the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share receivables net and provision for bad debts receivables net for our healthcare facilities segment primarily consists of amounts due from third party payors and patients from providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
receivables net for our specialty pharmacy segment primarily consists of amounts due from third party payors  institutions such as nursing homes  home health  hospice  hospitals  pharmacy stores  medicaid part d program  and customers from the sale of pharmacy services and merchandise 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets as of june was as follows  and our provision for bad debts  included in our results of operations  was as follows  and the largest component of bad debts in our patient accounts receivable for our healthcare facilities and specialty pharmacy segments relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
we attempt to verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled non emergency admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the estimated amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and non emergency urgent admissions in compliance with the emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and potentially our future access to capital 
if net revenues during fiscal year were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by  among other things  changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in private and federal or state governmental healthcare coverage 

index to financial statements balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item dollar amounts in thousands  except per share assumption approach used dollar amounts in thousands  except per share sensitivity analysis dollar amounts in thousands  except per share receivables net and provision for bad debts continued in general  we utilize the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  cash collection of all or a portion of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided  billing and follow up with third party payors  collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  sue to collect if the patient has the means to pay and chooses not to pay  and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off the accounts 
our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is typically no longer than days after the date of discharge of the patient or service to the patient or customer 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improved performance 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of the referral of an account to a collection agency vary among hospitals 
generally  we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency 
once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful  an account is written off from our patient accounting system against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance

this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as day s revenue in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians 
days outstanding payor class total medicare commercial medicaid self pay the above table shows  as of june   net hospital patient accounts receivable aged from patient date of service and are grouped by classification of verified insurance coverage 
the receivables are net of contractual allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
contractual allowances and the allowance for doubtful accounts are calculated by payor class and are not calculated by the aging of the patient billing date  therefore  these allowances have been allocated within the aging of the various payor classes based upon gross patient receivable amounts 
revenue recognition net patient service revenues for our healthcare facilities segment  we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
for our specialty pharmacy segment  we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided and at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise

accordingly  our gross revenues and patient receivables are reduced to net amounts receivable pursuant to such contracts or government payment rates through an allowance for contractual discounts

the sources of these revenues were as follows as a percentage of total revenues medicare  medicaid  and commercial insurance 
computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved 
in certain hospitals  the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor 
in other hospitals  the contractual allowances are estimated manually using historical collections for each type of payor 
for all hospitals  certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us 
all contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience on a periodic basis

if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on all of our commercial revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received and requires a high degree of judgment

goodwill  other intangible assets and accounting for business combinations goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets including separately identified intangible assets of acquired companies 
the company has two reportable business segments with goodwill 
our goodwill by business segment included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years was as follows in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other  asc goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed by us at least annually for impairment 
for purposes of these analyses  our estimate of fair value is based on the income approach  which estimates the fair value based on our future discounted cash flows 
our estimate of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets to be impaired  then we reduce the carrying value 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company performed an interim impairment testing of the goodwill and certain intangible assets of its subsidiaries as of march  the company concluded that the carrying value for its healthmont  llc subsidiary  part of the healthcare facilities segment  exceeded its fair value  and as a result  recognized a goodwill impairment charge of for such subsidiary during the year ended june  as part of the fiscal goodwill and intangibles impairment analysis  the company recognized that there has been a significant decline in net revenue during fy for the specialty pharmacy segment 
the analysis resulted in a  goodwill impairment charge for fiscal additionally  the company recognized a  impairment charge to trade name and a  impairment charge to customer relationships for fiscal healthcare facilities pharmacy the goodwill resulted from the acquisition of healthmont  inc and the acquisition of carmichael

con  non competition agreements  customer relationships  and medicare licenses are amortized over the terms of the agreements 
the trade name has been determined to have an indefinite life and  accordingly  is not amortized 
our other intangible assets by business segment included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years was as follows the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and are subject to change during the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we engage independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the time of acquisition 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance 
fair value estimates are derived from independent appraisals  established market values of comparable assets  or internal calculations of estimated future net cash flows 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns

to mitigate a portion of this risk  we have maintained insurance the reserve for professional and general liability claims is based upon independent actuarial calculations  which consider historical claims data  demographic actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses recorded during a reporting

for the periods march  to february   march  to february   march  to february  and march  to february  our self insured retention level is  on individual malpractice claims 
each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs increase  we may accept a higher level of risk in self insured retention levels 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims included in our consolidated balance sheets as of june was as follows  and the total expense for professional and general liability coverage  included in our consolidated results of operations  was as follows  and considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the determination of reserve estimates 
the reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
we revise our reserve estimation process by obtaining independent actuarial calculations quarterly 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes as estimated by our independent actuaries when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states  including georgia  have passed varying forms of tort reform which attempt to limit the number and types of claims and the amount of some medical malpractice awards 
if enacted limitations remain in place or if similar laws are passed in the states where our other hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
period 
in determining loss estimates  professional judgment is used by each actuary by selecting factors that are considered appropriate by the actuary for our specific circumstances 
changes in assumptions used by our independent actuary with respect to demographics and geography  industry trends  development patterns and judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact currently on our liquidity or capital resources

accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our net deferred tax asset balance net of valuation allowance in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years was as follows  and our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of june for the following years were as follows  and in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in the first step of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we identify tax issues that we believe may be challenged upon examination by the taxing authorities 
we also assess the likelihood of sustaining tax benefits associated with tax planning strategies and reduce tax benefits based on management s our deferred tax assets were  and our deferred tax liabilities were at june   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
the company believes that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our net deferred tax assets is remote 
the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur approximately of additional tax expense for plus applicable penalties and interest

we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
judgment regarding such likelihood 
we compute the tax on each contingency 
we then determine the amount of loss  or reduction in tax benefits based upon the foregoing and reflect such amount as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period

we understand that certain industry analysts and investors generally consider ebitda to be one measure of the liquidity of a company  and it is presented to assist analysts and investors in analyzing the ability of a company to generate cash  service debt and meet capital requirements 
we believe increased ebitda is an indicator of improved ability to service existing debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
ebitda  however  is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash liquidity 
because ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and is thus susceptible to varying calculations  ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other corporations 
where we adjust ebitda for non cash charges we refer to such measurement as adjusted ebitda  which we report on a company wide basis 
non cash adjustments in adjusted ebitda are 
index to financial statements not intended to be identified or characterized in any respect as non recurring  infrequent or unusual  if we believe such charge is reasonably likely to recur within two years  or if there was a similar charge or gain within the prior two years
