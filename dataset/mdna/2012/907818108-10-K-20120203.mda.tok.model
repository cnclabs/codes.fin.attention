item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to the financial statements and supplementary data  item  and other information in this report  including risk factors set forth in item a and critical accounting policies and cautionary information at the end of this item the railroad  along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates  is our one reportable business segment 
although revenue is analyzed by commodity  we analyze the net financial results of the railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network 
executive summary results safety we continued improving safety in and set records in nearly all of our safety metrics 
the employee injury incident rate per  man hours declined from these results reflect our continuing implementation of total safety culture tsc  an employee engagement initiative designed to establish  maintain  reinforce and promote safety practices among co workers  along with increased risk identification  coaching and enhanced training 
our use of laser  ultrasound and acoustic vibration monitoring to identify potential wheel and axle failures before they occur reduced our equipment incident rate to per million train miles  another best ever result 
with respect to public safety  we closed grade crossings in to reduce our exposure to incidents and continued using video cameras on our locomotives to assist in reviewing grade crossing incidents 
we now have camera equipped locomotives in the lead position on over of our through freight trains 
during  the rate of grade crossing incidents per million train miles decreased from  matching our record low for this measure 
overall  our safety results reflect our continued focus on the safety of our employees  our customers and the public 
financial performance in  we continued our record setting trend by generating operating income of billion  a increase over improved pricing and volume growth  partially offset by inflation and weather related costs  drove this increase 
our operating ratio for was  only slightly behind last year s record of 
net income of billion surpassed our previous milestone set in  translating into earnings of per diluted share for freight revenues our freight revenues grew year over year to billion 
freight revenues for all six commodity groups increased while volume increased in all groups except intermodal  which declined 
overall  volume increased in  with particularly strong growth in chemicals  industrial products  and automotive shipments 
higher fuel surcharges due to higher fuel prices  volume growth  and new fuel surcharge provisions in renegotiated contracts and core pricing gains also drove the growth in freight revenue in compared to network operations weather impacted our operations more significantly in than  including blizzards affecting the southwest and midwest  particularly the chicago area  historic midwestern floods and severe heat and drought in our southern region 
we deployed resources to address these adverse conditions and maintained reliable network operations 
as reported to the association of american railroads aar  average train speed decreased in compared to  reflecting the weather challenges  in addition to increased carloadings and changes in traffic mix 
average terminal dwell time increased due to the same factors that affected train speed along with a more active track replacement program  which can adversely affect operations 
average rail car inventory decreased slightly  despite a increase in volume  reflecting our efforts to adjust our freight car fleet to match operating performance and demand 
despite these operating challenges  we established a new record in our customer satisfaction index in  an indication that our ongoing efforts to improve operations translated into value for our customers 
fuel prices the barrel price averaged almost higher than  peaking in april  as the global economy strengthened and the us dollar weakened 
our average diesel fuel price per gallon rose from january to december of  due to higher prices for crude oil and conversion spreads 
compared to  our price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed increased  driving operating expenses up million excluding any impact from year over year volume  which accounted for almost half of the total increase in operating cost 
higher traffic volume accounted for 
table of contents nearly all of the remaining increase in fuel expense  reflecting a relatively flat year over year fuel consumption rate 
free cash flow cash generated by operating activities totaled billion  yielding record free cash flow of billion in free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the reclassification of our receivables securitization facility  less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid 
free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap by sec regulation g and item of sec regulation s k 
we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings 
free cash flow should be considered in addition to  rather than as a substitute for  cash provided by operating activities 
the following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities gaap measure to free cash flow non gaap measure millions cash provided by operating activities receivables securitization facility

a 
effective january   a new accounting standard required us to account for receivables transferred under our receivables securitization facility as secured borrowings in our consolidated statements of financial position and as financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the receivables securitization facility is included in our free cash flow calculation to adjust cash provided by operating activities as though our receivables securitization facility had been accounted for under the new accounting standard for all periods presented 
outlook safety operating a safe railroad benefits our employees  our customers  our shareholders  and the communities we serve 
we will continue using a multi faceted approach to safety  utilizing technology  risk assessment  quality control  training and employee engagement and targeted capital investments 
we will continue using and expanding the application of tsc throughout our operations 
this process allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety 
derailment prevention and the reduction of grade crossing incidents are critical aspects of our safety programs 
we will continue our efforts to increase rail detection  maintain and close crossings  install video cameras on locomotives  and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs including risk assessment strategies  various industry programs and local community activities 
transportation plan to build upon our success in recent years  we will continue evaluating traffic flows and network logistic patterns  which can be quite dynamic  to identify additional opportunities to simplify operations  remove network variability  and improve network efficiency and asset utilization 
we plan to adjust manpower and our locomotive and rail car fleets to meet customer needs and put us in a position to handle demand changes 
we also will continue utilizing industrial engineering techniques to improve productivity and network fluidity 
fuel prices uncertainty about the economy makes projections of fuel prices difficult 
we again could see volatile fuel prices during the year  as they are sensitive to global and us domestic demand  refining capacity  geopolitical events  weather conditions and other factors 
to reduce the impact of fuel price on earnings  we will continue to seek recovery from our customers through our fuel surcharge programs and expand our fuel conservation efforts 
capital plan in  we plan to make total capital investments of approximately billion  including expenditures for positive train control ptc  which may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments 
see further discussion in this item under liquidity and capital resources capital plan 

table of contents positive train control in response to a legislative mandate to implement ptc by the end of  we expect to spend approximately million during on developing and deploying ptc 
we currently estimate that ptc in accordance with implementing rules issued by the federal rail administration fra will cost us approximately billion by the end of this includes costs for installing the new system along our tracks  upgrading locomotives to work with the new system  and adding digital data communication equipment so all the parts of the system can communicate with each other 
during  we plan to continue testing the technology to evaluate its effectiveness 
financial expectations we are cautious about the economic environment but anticipate slow but steady volume growth that will exceed levels 
coupled with price  on going network improvements and operational productivity initiatives  we expect earnings that exceed earnings 
results of operations operating revenues millions change v change v freight revenues other revenues total we generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our six commodity groups 
freight revenues vary with volume carloads and average revenue per car arc 
changes in price  traffic mix and fuel surcharges drive arc 
we provide some of our customers with contractual incentives for meeting or exceeding specified cumulative volumes or shipping to and from specific locations  which we record as reductions to freight revenues based on the actual or projected future shipments 
we recognize freight revenues as shipments move from origin to destination 
we allocate freight revenues between reporting periods based on the relative transit time in each reporting period and recognize expenses as we incur them 
other revenues include revenues earned by our subsidiaries  revenues from our commuter rail operations  and accessorial revenues  which we earn when customers retain equipment owned or controlled by us or when we perform additional services such as switching or storage 
we recognize other revenues as we perform services or meet contractual obligations 
freight revenues for all six commodity groups increased during compared to  while volume increased in all except intermodal 
increased demand in many market sectors  with particularly strong growth in chemical  industrial products  and automotive shipments for the year  generated the increases 
arc increased  driven by higher fuel cost recoveries and core pricing gains 
fuel cost recoveries include fuel surcharge revenue and the impact of resetting the base fuel price for certain traffic  which is described below in more detail 
higher fuel prices  volume growth  and new fuel surcharge provisions in renegotiated contracts all combined to increase revenues from fuel surcharges 
freight revenues and volume levels for all six commodity groups increased during as a result of economic improvement in many market sectors 
we experienced particularly strong volume growth in automotive  intermodal  and industrial products shipments 
core pricing gains and higher fuel surcharges also increased freight revenues and drove a improvement in arc 
our fuel surcharge programs excluding index based contract escalators that contain some provision for fuel generated freight revenues of billion  billion  and million in   and  respectively 
higher fuel prices  volume growth  and new fuel surcharge provisions in contracts renegotiated during the year increased fuel surcharge amounts in and furthermore  for certain periods during  fuel prices dropped below the base at which our mileage based fuel surcharge begins  which resulted in no fuel surcharge recovery for associated shipments during those periods 
additionally  fuel surcharge revenue is not entirely comparable to prior periods as we continue to convert portions of our non regulated traffic to mileage based fuel surcharge programs 
in  other revenues increased from due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services 

table of contents in  other revenues increased from due primarily to higher revenues at our subsidiaries that broker intermodal and automotive services

table of contents agricultural products fuel surcharges  price improvements and modest volume growth increased agricultural freight revenue in versus the federal mandate for higher levels of ethanol in the nation s fuel supply and new business increased shipments of ethanol by in versus strong export demand for us wheat via gulf ports in the first half of was the primary driver of a increase in wheat and food grains shipments for compared to  despite a decrease in shipments in the second half of when us grain exports declined 
poor wheat production in some foreign markets drove the export demand during the first six months of the year 
agricultural revenue logo higher volume  fuel surcharges  and price improvements increased agricultural freight revenue in versus increased shipments from the midwest to export ports in the pacific northwest combined with heightened demand in mexico drove higher corn and feed grain shipments in increased corn and feed grain shipments into ethanol plants in california and idaho and continued growth in ethanol shipments also contributed to this increase 
in  some ethanol plants temporarily ceased operations due to lower ethanol margins  which contributed to the favorable year over year comparison 
in addition  strong export demand for us wheat via the gulf ports increased shipments of wheat and food grains compared to declines in domestic wheat and food shipments partially offset the growth in export shipments 
new business in feed and animal protein shipments also increased agricultural shipments in compared to automotive higher volume  core pricing gains and fuel surcharges improved automotive freight revenue from levels 
although higher production and sales levels during contributed to volume growth  the disaster in japan partially offset the increase in shipments 
the disruption caused by this event reduced parts shipments in the second quarter and shipments of international vehicles in the second and third quarters 
finished autos shipments were up in from  aided by a increase in the fourth quarter as the us light vehicle sales rate was the highest since the second quarter of automotive revenue logo increases of and in shipments of finished vehicles and automotive parts in  respectively  combined with core pricing gains and fuel surcharges  improved automotive freight revenue from relatively weak levels 
economic conditions in led to poor auto sales and reduced vehicle production  which in turn reduced shipments of finished vehicles and parts during the year 
chemicals volume gains  fuel surcharges and price improvements increased freight revenue from chemicals in versus in mid  we began moving crude oil shipments from the bakken formation in north dakota to facilities in louisiana 
this new business  along with shipments from the eagle ford shale formation in south texas  contributed to a increase in shipments of petroleum products during strong domestic demand and robust spring planting increased fertilizer shipments by versus additionally  improving market conditions increased demand for industrial chemicals during  driving volume levels up versus chemicals revenue logo 
table of contents higher volume  price improvements  and fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from chemicals in versus reduced inventories and purchases delayed from increased fertilizer shipments by in a modest rebound in market conditions and more normalized inventory levels increased demand for industrial chemicals during the year  driving volume levels up versus in addition  shipments of soda ash increased as continued strong export demand outpaced weak export demand 
energy core pricing gains  higher fuel surcharges  and increased volume grew energy freight revenue from levels 
shipments of coal from the southern powder river basin sprb were up in compared to  reflecting new business to wisconsin facilities and the start up of a new power plant near waco  texas 
completion of a year long equipment relocation process at one of the mines in the third quarter of and minimal production problems elsewhere improved shipments from colorado and utah by in versus these gains  along with increased exports to europe and asia  offset first half production problems and weak demand from eastern coal utilities 
energy revenue logo core pricing gains  higher fuel surcharges and modest volume growth increased freight revenue from energy shipments in compared to shipments from the sprb were up  driven by higher demand resulting from improved economic conditions  warmer summer weather  and more efficient deliveries higher tons per car and increased train size 
higher inventory levels carried over from partially offset this demand increase 
shipments from colorado and utah mines were down in versus due to mine production interruptions and increased competition from other low cost fuel options natural gas and eastern coal  weaker demand from our industrial customers  and high inventories at some utility customer locations 
industrial products increased volume  fuel surcharges  and core pricing improvement increased freight revenue from industrial products in versus shipments of non metallic minerals primarily frac sand grew in response to a dramatic rise in horizontal drilling activity for natural gas and oil  while steel shipments increased due to higher demand for steel coils and plate for automotive and pipe production 
in addition  an increase in iron ore export business to china also drove volume growth 
conversely  lower commercial construction activity reduced stone  sand and gravel shipments in compared to industrial products revenue logo volume gains  core pricing improvement  and higher fuel surcharges increased freight revenue from industrial products in versus a federal government remediation program involving removal of uranium mill tailings from a moab  utah  site drove an increase in short haul hazardous waste shipments versus shipments under this program began modestly during the second quarter of steel shipments also increased due to improving economic conditions  while shipments of non metallic minerals primarily frac sand grew in response to more drilling for natural gas 
stone  sand and gravel shipments grew in compared to as increased oil drilling more than offset the decline in commercial construction activity 

table of contents intermodal fuel surcharge gains  including better contract provisions for fuel cost recovery  and pricing improvements  partially offset by lower volume  increased freight revenue from intermodal shipments in compared to volume from international traffic decreased in versus  driven by softer economic conditions  reflected in a muted international peak shipping season  which usually starts in the third quarter  and the loss of a customer contract 
conversely  conversions from truck to rail and recovering consumer demand offset competition for domestic shipments  resulting in a volume increase in domestic shipments during intermodal revenue logo increased volume  higher fuel surcharges including new recovery provisions in contracts renegotiated in  and pricing gains drove the increase in freight revenue from intermodal shipments in compared to domestic and international traffic increased from levels  reflecting improvements in economic conditions 
international volumes grew in response to continued inventory restocking and higher consumer demand 
domestic shipments increased as a result of conversions from truck to rail fueled by improved service 
a new contract with hub group  inc  which included additional shipments  was executed in the second quarter of and contributed to the increase in domestic shipments 
mexico business each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from mexico 
revenue from mexico business increased to billion in versus volume levels increased in aggregate versus  with particularly strong growth in automotive and industrial products 
energy was the one commodity group that declined as one of our customers conducted a supplier contract renewal during the year  shifting transportation modes from rail to truck during the process 
revenue from mexico business increased in versus to billion 
volume levels for all six commodity groups increased  up in aggregate versus  with particularly strong growth in automotive  industrial products  and intermodal shipments

cost savings from productivity improvements and better resource utilization partially offset these increases 
a million one time payment relating to a transaction with csx intermodal  inc csxi increased operating expenses during the first quarter of  which favorably affects the comparison of operating expenses in to those in operating expenses logo operating expenses increased billion in versus our fuel price per gallon increased during the year  accounting for million of the increase 
wage and benefit inflation  depreciation  volume related costs  and property taxes also contributed to higher expenses during compared to cost savings from productivity improvements and better resource utilization partially offset these increases 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits include wages  payroll taxes  health and welfare costs  pension costs  other postretirement benefits  and incentive costs 
a combination of general wage and benefit inflation  volume related expenses  higher training costs associated with new hires  additional crew costs due to speed restrictions caused by the midwest flooding and heat and drought in the south  and higher pension expense drove the increase during compared to general wage and benefit inflation increased costs by approximately million in compared to volume related expenses and higher equity and incentive compensation also drove costs up during the year 
workforce levels declined in compared to as network efficiencies and ongoing productivity initiatives enabled us to effectively handle the increase in volume levels with fewer employees 
fuel fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non highway vehicles and heavy equipment 
higher locomotive diesel fuel prices  which averaged including taxes and transportation costs in  compared to per gallon in  increased expenses by million 
in addition  higher gasoline prices for highway and non highway vehicles also increased year over year

expenses for contract services increased million in versus  driven by volume related external transportation services incurred by our subsidiaries  and various other types of contractual services  including flood related repairs  mitigation and improvements 
volume related crew transportation and lodging costs  as well as expenses associated with jointly owned operating facilities  also increased costs compared to in addition  an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service due to increased volume and additional capacity for weather related issues and warranty expirations increased expenses in a million increase in costs for contract services drove the higher expenses in versus volume related trucking and lift costs for intermodal containers and crew transportation and lodging costs also increased costs from in addition  an increase in locomotive maintenance materials used to prepare a portion of our locomotive fleet for return to active service increased expenses during the year compared to conversely  a decrease in freight car maintenance activity during drove lower freight car material costs  partially offsetting the cost increases versus depreciation the majority of depreciation relates to road property  including rail  ties  ballast  and other track material 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting ongoing capital spending  increased depreciation expense in compared to higher depreciation rates for rail and other track material also contributed to the increase 
the higher rates  which became effective january   resulted primarily from increased track usage based on higher gross ton miles in 
a higher depreciable asset base  reflecting higher capital spending in recent years  increased depreciation expense in compared to costs also increased million in due to the restructuring of certain locomotive leases in the second quarter of lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material partially offset the increases 
the lower rates  which became effective january   resulted from reduced track usage based on lower gross ton miles in equipment and other rents equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies  freight car  intermodal  and locomotive leases  and office and other rent expenses 
costs increased in versus as higher short term freight car rental expense and container lease expense offset lower freight car and locomotive lease expense 
short term freight car rental expense increased in compared to  reflecting increased shipments of finished vehicles and intermodal containers 
increased lease expenses for containers also drove the increase 
conversely  lower lease expense for freight cars and locomotives decreased costs compared to the restructuring of locomotive leases completed in may also reduced lease expense by million in compared to other other expenses include personal injury  freight and property damage  destruction of equipment  insurance  environmental  bad debt  state and local taxes  utilities  telephone and cellular  employee travel  computer software  and other general expenses 
higher property taxes  casualty costs associated with destroyed equipment  damaged freight and property and environmental costs increased other costs in compared to a one time payment of million in the first quarter of related to a transaction with csxi and continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury  which reduced our personal injury expense year over year  partially offset increases in other costs 
other costs were higher in compared to  driven by higher property taxes and the million one time payment in the first quarter of related to a transaction with csxi 
a million payment in to pacer international  inc and lower expenses for freight and property damages partially offset these increases in comparing with in addition  personal injury expense was lower in compared to  reflecting continued improvement in our personal injury incident rate and lower settlement costs per claim 
the change in asbestos related claim expenses in versus offset 
table of contents the lower personal injury costs 
as a result of our annual review of asbestos related costs  we reduced expenses by million  thus driving the unfavorable variance in non operating items millions change v change v other income interest expense income taxes other income other income increased in versus due to higher gains from real estate sales  lower environmental costs associated with non operating properties and the comparative impact of premiums paid for early redemption of long term debt in the first quarter of other income decreased in versus due to lower gains from real estate sales the second quarter of included a million pre tax gain from a land sale to the regional transportation district in colorado and premiums paid for early debt redemption

maintenance activities and weather disruptions  combined with higher volume levels  led to a decrease in average train speed in compared to a record set in average terminal dwell time average terminal dwell time is the average time that a rail car spends at our terminals 
lower average terminal dwell time improves asset utilization and service 
average terminal dwell time increased in compared to additional volume  weather challenges  track replacement programs  and a shift of traffic mix to more manifest shipments  which require additional terminal processing  all contributed to the increase 
average terminal dwell time increased in compared to  driven in part by our network plan to increase the length of numerous trains to improve overall efficiency  which resulted in higher terminal dwell time for some cars 
average rail car inventory average rail car inventory is the daily average number of rail cars on our lines  including rail cars in storage 
lower average rail car inventory reduces congestion in our yards and sidings  which increases train speed  reduces average terminal dwell time  and improves rail car utilization 
average rail car inventory decreased slightly in compared to  as we continued to adjust the size of our freight car fleet 
average rail car inventory decreased in compared to  while we handled a increase in carloads during the period compared to we maintained more freight cars off line and retired a number of old freight cars  which drove the decrease 
gross and revenue ton miles gross ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled 
revenue ton miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles 
gross and revenue ton miles increased in compared to  driven by a increase in carloads and mix changes to heavier commodity groups  notably a increase in energy shipments 
gross and revenue ton miles increased and  respectively  in compared to due to a increase in carloads

our operating ratio improved points to in and points to in efficiently leveraging volume increases  core pricing gains  and productivity initiatives drove the improvement in and more than offset the impact of higher fuel prices during the year 
employees employee levels were up in versus  driven by a increase in volume levels  a higher number of trainmen  engineers  and yard employees receiving training during the year  and increased work on capital projects 
employee levels were down in compared to despite a increase in volume levels 
we leveraged the additional volumes through network efficiencies and other productivity initiatives 
in addition  we successfully managed the growth of our full time equivalent train and engine force levels at a rate less than half of our carload growth in all other operating functions and support organizations reduced their full time equivalent force levels  benefiting from continued productivity initiatives 
customer satisfaction index our customer satisfaction survey asks customers to rate how satisfied they are with our performance over the last months on a variety of attributes

our december  debt to capital ratios decreased as a result of a million net decrease in debt from december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  our receivables securitization facility  and our revolving credit facility  as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets 
we had billion of committed credit available under our credit facility  with no borrowings outstanding as of december  we did not make any borrowings under this facility during the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the receivables securitization facility was million as of december   and is included in our consolidated statements of financial position as debt due after one year 
the receivables securitization facility obligates us to maintain an investment grade bond rating 
if our bond rating were to deteriorate  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity 
access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financings is dependent on market conditions 
deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity 
access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability 
we expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity by issuing bonds to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets 
at december  and  we had a working capital surplus 
this reflects a strong cash position  which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment 
in addition  we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet cash requirements  and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities 
cash flows millions cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash used in financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents operating activities higher net income and lower cash income tax payments in increased cash provided by operating activities compared to the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of  enacted in december  provided for bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during  and bonus depreciation for qualified investments made during as a result of the act  the company deferred a substantial portion of its income tax expense 
this deferral decreased income tax payments  thereby contributing to the positive operating cash flow 
in future years  however  additional cash will be used to pay income taxes that were previously deferred 
in addition  the adoption of a new accounting standard in january of changed the accounting treatment for our receivables securitization facility from a sale of undivided interests recorded as an operating activity to a secured borrowing recorded as a financing activity  which decreased cash provided by operating activities by million in higher net income in increased cash provided by operating activities compared to investing activities higher capital investments partially offset by higher proceeds from asset sales in drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to higher capital investments and lower proceeds from asset sales in drove the increase in cash used in investing activities compared to

major investment categories include replacing and improving track infrastructure  upgrading our locomotive  freight car and container fleet  including acquisition of locomotives and  freight cars including large covered hoppers  gondolas  and small covered hoppers  improving technology  including investing in ptc  and other capital projects 
additionally  we will continue to increase our network and terminal capacity  for example  to balance terminal capacity with mainline capacity being added by our double tracking project on the sunset corridor  we are constructing a rail facility at santa teresa  new mexico  that initially will include a run through and fueling facility and an intermodal ramp 
we expect to fund our cash capital investments by using some or all of the following cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  and cash on hand 
our annual capital plan is a critical component of our long term strategic plan  which we expect will enhance the long term value of the corporation for our shareholders by providing sufficient resources to i replace and improve our existing track infrastructure to provide safe and fluid operations  ii increase network efficiency by adding or improving facilities and track  and iii make investments that meet customer demand and take advantage of opportunities for long term growth 
financing activities cash used in financing activities increased in versus higher dividend payments in of million compared to million in  reflecting our increased dividend rate and the repurchase of billion of our common stock  a million increase from repurchases  drove the increase

on december   we had billion of credit available under the facility  which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper 
we did not draw on either facility during commitment fees and interest rates payable under the facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated  investment grade borrowers 
the facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on london interbank offered rates  plus a spread  depending upon our senior unsecured debt ratings 
the facility requires the corporation to maintain a debt to net worth coverage ratio as a condition to making a borrowing 
at december   and december  and at all times during the year  we were in compliance with this covenant 
the definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt to net worth coverage ratio includes  among other things  certain credit arrangements  capital leases  guarantees and unfunded and vested pension benefits under title iv of erisa 
at december   the debt to net worth coverage ratio allowed us to carry up to billion of debt as defined in the facility  and we had billion of debt as defined in the facility outstanding at that date 
under our current capital plans  we expect to continue to satisfy the debt to net worth coverage ratio  however  many factors beyond our reasonable control including the risk factors in item a of this report could affect our ability to comply with this provision in the future 
the facility does not include any other financial restrictions  credit rating triggers other than rating dependent pricing  or any other provision that could require us to post collateral 
the facility also includes a million cross default provision and a change of control provision 
during  we did not issue or repay any commercial paper and  at december  and  we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our revolving credit facility supports outstanding commercial paper balances  which do not reduce the amount of borrowings available under the facility 
at december  and  we reclassified as long term debt approximately million of debt due within one year that we intend to refinance 
this reclassification reflected our ability and intent to refinance any short term borrowings and certain current maturities of long term debt on a long term basis 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges for each of the years ended december    and  our ratio of earnings to fixed charges was   and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges was computed on a consolidated basis 
earnings represent income from continuing operations  less equity earnings net of distributions  plus fixed charges and income taxes 
fixed charges represent interest charges  amortization of debt discount  and the estimated amount representing the interest portion of rental charges 
see exhibit to this report for the calculation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges 
common shareholders equity dividend restrictions our revolving credit facility includes a debt to net worth covenant discussed in the credit facilities section above that  under certain circumstances  restricts the payment of cash dividends to our shareholders 
the amount of retained earnings available for dividends was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 

table of contents share repurchase program the shares repurchased in and the first quarter of  shown in the table below  were repurchased under our repurchase program that expired on march  effective april   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of our common stock by march   replacing our previous repurchase program 
the shares repurchased in the second  third  and fourth quarters of  shown in the table below  were purchased under the new program 
as of december   we repurchased a total of billion of our common stock since the commencement of purchases under our repurchase programs 
number of shares purchased average price paid first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total remaining number of shares that may yet be repurchased management s assessments of market conditions and other pertinent facts guide the timing and volume of all repurchases 
we expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations  the sale or lease of various operating and non operating properties  debt issuances  and cash on hand 
repurchased shares are recorded in treasury stock at cost  which includes any applicable commissions and fees 
shelf registration statement and significant new borrowings under our current shelf registration  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in one or more offerings 
we have no immediate plans to issue equity securities  however  we will continue to explore opportunities to replace existing debt or access capital through issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration  and  therefore  we may issue additional debt securities at any time 
during  we issued the following unsecured  fixed rate debt securities under our current shelf registration date description of securities august  million of notes due september  the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program 
these debt securities include change of control provisions 
at december   we had remaining authority to issue up to billion of debt securities under our shelf registration 
during the third quarter of  we renegotiated and extended for three years on substantially similar terms a million floating rate term loan  which will mature on august  debt exchange on june   we exchanged million of various outstanding notes and debentures due between and existing notes for million of notes new notes due july   plus cash consideration of approximately million and million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes 
the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt  and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes 
no gain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange 
costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately million and were included in interest expense during the year ended december  
table of contents the following table lists the outstanding notes and debentures that were exchanged millions principal amount exchanged notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due notes due debentures due notes due total on july   we exchanged million of notes due in existing notes for notes new notes due july   plus cash consideration of approximately million and million for accrued and unpaid interest on the existing notes 
the cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt  and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the existing notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the term of the new notes 
there was no gain or loss recognized as a result of the exchange 
costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debtholders totaled approximately million and were included in interest expense during the third quarter 
debt redemptions on december   we redeemed the remaining million of our notes due april   and all million of our outstanding notes due january  the redemptions resulted in an early extinguishment charge of million 
on march   we redeemed million of our notes due april  the redemption resulted in an early extinguishment charge of million in the first quarter of on november   we redeemed all million of our outstanding notes due january  the redemption resulted in a million early extinguishment charge 
receivables securitization facility on january   we adopted accounting standards update no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets asu 
asu limits the circumstances in which transferred financial assets can be derecognized and requires enhanced disclosures regarding transfers of financial assets and a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets 
as a result  we no longer account for the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under our receivables securitization facility as a sale 
in addition  transfers of receivables occurring on or after january   are reflected as debt issued in our consolidated statements of cash flows and recognized as debt due after one year in our consolidated statements of financial position 
under the receivables securitization facility  the railroad sells most of its accounts receivable to union pacific receivables  inc upri  a bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
upri may subsequently transfer  without recourse on a day revolving basis  an undivided interest in eligible accounts receivable to investors 
the total capacity to transfer undivided interests to investors under the facility was million at december  and  respectively 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors under the facility was million at both december  and the value of the undivided interest held by investors was supported by billion and million of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the value of the interest retained by upri was billion and million  respectively 
this retained interest is included in accounts receivable  net in our consolidated statements of financial position 
the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors could fluctuate based upon the availability of eligible receivables and is directly affected by changing business volumes and credit risks  including default and dilution 
if default or dilution ratios increase one percent  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would not change as of december  should our credit rating fall below investment grade  the value of the outstanding undivided interest held by investors would be reduced  and  in certain cases  the investors would have the right to discontinue the facility 

table of contents the railroad collected approximately billion and billion of receivables during the years ended december  and  respectively 
upri used certain of these proceeds to purchase new receivables under the facility 
the costs of the receivables securitization facility include interest  which will vary based on prevailing commercial paper rates  program fees paid to banks  commercial paper issuing costs  and fees for unused commitment availability 
the costs of the receivables securitization facility are included in interest expense and were million and million for and  respectively 
prior to adoption of the new accounting standard  the costs of the receivables securitization facility were included in other income and were million for the investors have no recourse to the railroad s other assets  except for customary warranty and indemnity claims 
creditors of the railroad do not have recourse to the assets of upri 
in august  the receivables securitization facility was renewed for an additional day period at comparable terms and conditions 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and as referenced in the tables below  we have contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect our financial condition 
based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including material sources of off balance sheet and structured finance arrangements  other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets as described in item a of part ii of this report  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event  or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
in addition  our commercial obligations  financings  and commitments are customary transactions that are similar to those of other comparable corporations  particularly within the transportation industry

the final guarantee expires in we are not aware of any existing event of default that would require us to satisfy these guarantees 
we do not expect that these guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
other matters labor agreements in january  the nation s largest freight railroads began the current round of negotiations with the labor unions 
generally  contract negotiations with the various unions take place over an extended period of time 
this round of negotiations was no exception 
in september  the rail industry reached agreements with the united transportation union 
on november   a presidential emergency board peb appointed by president obama issued recommendations to resolve the disputes between the us railroads and unions that had not yet reached agreements 
since then  ten unions reached agreements with the railroads  all of them generally patterned on the recommendations of the peb  and the unions subsequently ratified these agreements 
the railroad industry reached a tentative agreement with the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe on february   eliminating the immediate threat of a national rail strike 
the bmwe now will commence ratification of this tentative agreement by its members 
inflation long periods of inflation significantly increase asset replacement costs for capital intensive companies 
as a result  assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels  depreciation charges on an inflation adjusted basis would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts 
derivative financial instruments we may use derivative financial instruments in limited instances to assist in managing our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and fuel prices 
we are not a party to leveraged derivatives and  by policy  do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged  both at inception and throughout the hedged period 
we formally document the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items at inception  as well as our risk management objectives  strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions  and method of assessing hedge effectiveness 
changes in the fair market value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are charged to earnings 
we may use swaps  collars  futures  and or forward contracts to mitigate the risk of adverse movements in interest rates and fuel prices  however  the use of these derivative financial instruments may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 

table of contents market and credit risk we address market risk related to derivative financial instruments by selecting instruments with value fluctuations that highly correlate with the underlying hedged item 
we manage credit risk related to derivative financial instruments  which is minimal  by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and periodic settlements 
at december  and  we were not required to provide collateral  nor had we received collateral  relating to our hedging activities 
determination of fair value we determine the fair values of our derivative financial instrument positions based upon current fair values as quoted by recognized dealers or the present value of expected future cash flows 
sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition 
these hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results 
at december   we had variable rate debt representing approximately of our total debt 
if variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in than our december  variable rate  which was approximately  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable rate debt at december  market risk for fixed rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of december   and amounts to an increase of approximately million to the fair value of our debt at december  we estimated the fair values of our fixed rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates 
interest rate fair value hedges we manage our overall exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by adjusting the proportion of fixed and floating rate debt instruments within our debt portfolio over a given period 
we generally manage the mix of fixed and floating rate debt through the issuance of targeted amounts of each as debt matures or as we require incremental borrowings 
we employ derivatives  primarily swaps  as one of the tools to obtain the targeted mix 
in addition  we also obtain flexibility in managing interest costs and the interest rate mix within our debt portfolio by evaluating the issuance of and managing outstanding callable fixed rate debt securities 
swaps allow us to convert debt from fixed rates to variable rates and thereby hedge the risk of changes in the debt s fair value attributable to the changes in interest rates 
we account for swaps as fair value hedges using the short cut method as allowed by the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb accounting standards codification asc  therefore  we do not record any ineffectiveness within our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate cash flow hedges we report changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged item affects earnings 
at december  and  we recorded reductions of million and million  respectively  as an accumulated other comprehensive loss that is being amortized on a straight line basis through september  as of december  and  we had no interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  because this asu impacts presentation only  it will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
asserted and unasserted claims various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries 
we cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  however  to the extent possible  where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably 
table of contents estimated  we have recorded a liability 
we do not expect that any known lawsuits  claims  environmental costs  commitments  contingent liabilities  or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters 
indemnities our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements  including certain tax indemnifications  can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount  depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements 
due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved  we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements 
we do not have any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions 
climate change although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see risk factors under item a of this report  we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact 
however  we continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce the impact of our operations on the environment  including investments in new technologies  using training programs to reduce fuel consumption  and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following critical accounting policies are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in note to the financial statements and supplementary data  item these critical accounting policies affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material 
personal injury the cost of personal injuries to employees and others related to our activities is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year 
we use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability  including unasserted claims 
the federal employers liability act fela governs compensation for work related accidents 
under fela  damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out of court settlements 
we offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work 
our personal injury liability is discounted to present value using applicable us treasury rates 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million 
we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other 
our personal injury liability activity was as follows millions beginning balance current year accruals changes in estimates for prior years payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december 
table of contents our personal injury claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december asbestos we are a defendant in a number of lawsuits in which current and former employees and other parties allege exposure to asbestos 
we assess our potential liability using a statistical analysis of resolution costs for asbestos related claims 
this liability is updated annually and excludes future defense and processing costs 
the liability for resolving both asserted and unasserted claims was based on the following assumptions the ratio of future claims by alleged disease would be consistent with historical averages adjusted for inflation 
the number of claims filed against us will decline each year 
the average settlement values for asserted and unasserted claims will be equivalent to historical averages 
the percentage of claims dismissed in the future will be equivalent to historical averages 
our liability for asbestos related claims is not discounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments 
approximately of the recorded liability related to asserted claims  and approximately related to unasserted claims at december  because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of asbestos related claims  it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims may range from approximately million to million 
we record an accrual at the low end of the range as no amount of loss is more probable than any other 
in conjunction with the liability update performed in  we also reassessed estimated insurance recoveries 
we have recognized an asset for estimated insurance recoveries at december  and our asbestos related liability activity was as follows millions beginning balance accruals credits payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december our asbestos related claims activity was as follows open claims  beginning balance new claims settled or dismissed claims open claims  ending balance at december we believe that our estimates of liability for asbestos related claims and insurance recoveries are reasonable and probable 
the amounts recorded for asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries were based on currently known facts 
however  future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  average settlement costs  and insurance coverage issues  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than the projected amounts 
estimates also may vary in the future if strategies  activities  and outcomes of asbestos litigation materially change  federal and state laws governing asbestos litigation increase or decrease the probability or amount of 
table of contents compensation of claimants  and there are material changes with respect to payments made to claimants by other defendants 
environmental we are subject to federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations 
we identified sites at which we are or may be liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements 
this includes sites that are the subject of actions taken by the us government  of which are currently on the superfund national priorities list 
certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites  consequently  our ultimate environmental liability may include costs relating to activities of other parties  in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site 
when we identify an environmental issue with respect to property owned  leased  or otherwise used in our business  we perform  with the assistance of our consultants  environmental assessments on the property 
we expense the cost of the assessments as incurred 
we accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and we can reasonably estimate such costs 
we do not discount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is not fixed or readily determinable 
at december   less than of our environmental liability was discounted at  while approximately of our environmental liability was discounted at at december  our environmental liability activity was as follows millions 
a 
beginning balance accruals payments ending balance at december current portion  ending balance at december 
a 
payments include million to resolve the omaha lead site liability 
our environmental site activity was as follows open sites  beginning balance new sites closed sites open sites  ending balance at december the liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites  as well as ongoing monitoring costs  but excludes any anticipated recoveries from third parties 
cost estimates are based on information available for each site  financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and existing technology  laws  and regulations 
the ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties  site specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties  the degree of contamination by various wastes  the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites  and the speculative nature of remediation costs 
estimates of liability may vary over time due to changes in federal  state  and local laws governing environmental remediation 
current obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity 
property and depreciation our railroad operations are highly capital intensive  and our large base of homogeneous  network type assets turns over on a continuous basis 
each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers 
assets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property criteria 
properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated service lives  which are measured in years  except for rail in high density traffic corridors ie  all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment  yard and switching tracks  and electronic yards for which lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track 
we use the group method of depreciation in which all items with similar characteristics  use  and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes  
table of contents and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates 
the group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources  not as singular items 
we currently have more than depreciable asset classes  and we may increase or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology  asset strategies  or other factors 
we determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property by means of depreciation studies 
we perform depreciation studies at least every three years for equipment and every six years for track assets ie  rail and other track material  ties  and ballast and other road property 
our depreciation studies take into account the following factors statistical analysis of historical patterns of use and retirements of each of our asset classes  evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets  evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices  and expected salvage to be received upon retirement 
for rail in high density traffic corridors  we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track 
it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ie  the amount of weight carried over the rail 
the service lives also vary based on rail weight  rail condition eg  new or secondhand  and rail type eg  straight or curve 
our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives 
for rail in high density traffic corridors  we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton miles carried over the rail ie  the weight of loaded and empty freight cars  locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile 
rail in high density traffic corridors accounts for approximately percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material 
based on the number of gross ton miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during  the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately years to approximately years 
for all other depreciable assets  we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies 
changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively 
estimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use  technology  asset strategies  and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets 
we are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets 
actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates  which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods 
changes in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods depreciation expense and have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year  annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
our recent depreciation studies have resulted in changes in depreciation rates for some asset classes  but did not significantly affect our annual depreciation expense 
under group depreciation  the historical cost net of salvage of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized 
the historical cost of certain track assets is estimated using i inflation indices published by the bureau of labor statistics and ii the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies 
the indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes 
because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired  we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate 
in addition  we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient or in excess of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies 
any deficiency or excess is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets 

table of contents for retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do not occur in the normal course of business  a gain or loss may be recognized if the retirement meets each of the following three conditions i is unusual  ii is material in amount  and iii varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies 
during the last three fiscal years  no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties 
a gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are not part of our railroad operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
these expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law  the effects of future tax legislation are not anticipated 
future tax legislation  such as a change in the corporate tax rate  could have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
for example  a increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately million 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on management s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset 
in and  there were no valuation allowances 
we recognize tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
a liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards 
pension and other postretirement benefits we use an actuarial analysis to measure the liabilities and expenses associated with providing pension and medical and life insurance benefits opeb to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses  we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
for opeb  the critical assumptions are the discount rate and health care cost trend rate 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually  and selected assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on a mercer yield curve of high quality corporate bonds rated aa by a recognized rating agency for which the timing and amount of cash flows matches our plans expected benefit payments 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
health care cost trend rate is based on our historical rates of inflation and expected market conditions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit for and the estimated impact on net periodic pension and opeb cost benefit relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension opeb discount rate expected return on plan assets n a compensation increase n a health care cost trend rate pre current n a pre level in n a
