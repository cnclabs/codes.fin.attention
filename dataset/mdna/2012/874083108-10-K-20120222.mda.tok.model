our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
our company we are one of the world s largest and oldest lessors of intermodal containers and chassis 
intermodal containers are large  standardized steel boxes used to transport freight by ship  rail or truck 
because of the handling efficiencies they provide  intermodal containers are the primary means by which many goods and materials are shipped internationally 
chassis are used for the transportation of containers domestically 
we operate our business in one industry  intermodal transportation equipment  and have two business segments equipment leasing we own  lease and ultimately dispose of containers and chassis from our lease fleet  as well as manage containers owned by third parties 
equipment trading we purchase containers from shipping line customers  and other sellers of containers  and resell these containers to container traders and users of containers for storage or one way shipment 
operations our consolidated operations include the acquisition  leasing  re leasing and subsequent sale of multiple types of intermodal containers and chassis 
as of december   our total fleet consisted of  containers and chassis  including  containers under management for third parties  representing  twenty foot equivalent units teu 
we have an extensive global presence  offering leasing services through approximately third party container depot facilities in countries as of december  our customers are among the world s largest shipping lines and include  among others  apl nol  cma cgm  hapag lloyd  mediterranean shipping company and nyk line 
for the year ended december   our twenty largest customers accounted for approximately of our leasing revenues  our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our leasing revenues  and our largest customer accounted for of our leasing revenues

ceu is a ratio used to convert the actual number of containers in our fleet to a figure based on the relative purchase price of our various equipment types to that of a foot dry container 
for example  the ceu ratio for a foot standard height dry container is  and a foot high cube refrigerated container is the ceu ratios used in this calculation are from our debt agreements and may differ slightly from ceu ratios used by others in the industry 
we lease five types of equipment dry freight containers  which are used for general cargo such as manufactured component parts  consumer staples  electronics and apparel  refrigerated containers  which are used for perishable items such as fresh and frozen foods  special containers  which are used for heavy and oversized cargo such as marble slabs  building products and machinery  chassis  which are used for the transportation of containers domestically  and tank containers  which are used to transport bulk liquid products such as chemicals 
our in house equipment sales 
table of contents group manages the sale process for our used containers and chassis from our equipment leasing fleet and buys and sells used and new containers and chassis acquired from third parties 
the percentages of our equipment fleet in units as of december   and our leasing revenues by equipment type for the full year were as follows equipment type percent of total fleet units percent of leasing revenue dry refrigerated special chassis tank equipment leasing fleet equipment trading fleet total we generally lease our equipment on a per diem basis to our customers under three types of leases long term leases  finance leases and service leases 
long term leases  typically with initial contractual terms ranging from three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest daily cost to the customer because customers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
service leases command a premium per diem rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
we also have expired long term leases whose fixed terms have ended but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments pursuant to the terms of the initial contract 
some leases have contractual terms that have features reflective of both long term and service leases and we classify such leases as either long term or service leases  depending upon which features we believe are the most predominant 
the following table provides a summary of our equipment leasing fleet portfolio by lease type  based on total on hire units as of the dates indicated below lease portfolio december  december  december  long term leases finance leases service leases expired long term leases units on hire total as of december   and  our long term and finance leases had an average remaining contract term of approximately months  months and months  respectively  assuming no leases are renewed 
operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gains or losses that we realize on the sale of our used equipment and the net sales margins on our equipment trading activities 

table of contents our leasing revenues are primarily driven by the size of our owned fleet  utilization and average rental rates 
our leasing revenues also include ancillary fees driven by container pick up and drop off volumes 
leasing revenues for increased to million  compared to million for this significant increase was driven by our aggressive investment in our fleet through new equipment purchases and sale leaseback transactions in both and in  we benefited from a full year of revenue from the over million invested in containers during and a partial year of revenue from the nearly million invested in containers during in addition  we were able to place a large portion of these new containers on hire at lease rates exceeding our portfolio average 
our utilization also remained high throughout  averaging  higher than in owned fleet size 
as of december   our owned fleet included  teus  an increase of from december  the net book value of our revenue earning assets increased in  increasing at a faster rate than the teu growth of our fleet due to the relatively high cost of dry containers throughout and our significant purchases of high cost refrigerated and tank containers 
our investments in were supported by a favorable supply demand balance for containers and an increase in the use of leasing by many of our major customers 
a severe global shortage of containers developed in due to a lack of container production in  a rapid recovery in trade volumes in  and practical constraints faced by container manufacturers in ramping up production to meet the renewed demand for containers 
our investment program in was further supported by an increased reliance on leasing by our shipping line customers due to financial challenges they are facing as a result of low freight rates and the need to fund large vessel purchases 
historically  shipping lines have generally purchased of the containers they operate and leased from leasing companies like tal 
in and  we estimate that leasing companies purchased the majority of new containers  and we saw an increased level of customer interest in sale leaseback transactions  where our customers typically sell a large number of in service containers to leasing companies and then lease back the same containers for continued use 
during  we invested nearly million in new container purchases and sale leaseback transactions including over  teu of dry containers and approximately  teu of refrigerated containers  of which approximately together with our beginning inventory of factory units as of january  was either on hire or committed to lease transactions at december  most of our investments were made in the first half of the year 
at the beginning of  many of our customers and market forecasters were projecting that containerized trade growth would exceed during the year 
we concluded a large number of lease agreements with our customers during the first part of the year as many of them sought to lock in access to equipment due to their expectations for strong trade growth and concern that a renewed container shortage might emerge during we placed large orders for new containers during the first half of to support these lease agreements 
however  trade growth  especially for the main east west head haul trades  was less than expected  and pick ups of containers committed to lease in the first part of the year lingered through the peak summer season 
as a result  additional lease and investment opportunities for new dry containers in the second half of were limited 
nevertheless  the combination of very strong new dry container investment early in the year  the completion of substantial sale leaseback agreements for in service containers with several of our customers during the middle of the year  and on going investments in our refrigerated  special and tank container product lines allowed tal to reach nearly million of new investment in  leading to a increase in our revenue earning assets during the year 
utilization 
our average utilization was for the full year of  an increase of from the average for ending utilization decreased from as of december  to 
table of contents as of december  our dry container utilization was exceptionally high throughout  even as the pace of new container lease outs slowed in the second half  due to the general tight supply demand balance for containers  and as shipping lines retained existing leased containers on hire in in anticipation of strong peak season demand for containers  and to benefit from low historical lease rates 
however  container redeliveries began to return toward historically normal levels toward the end of the year  after the end of the peak season for dry containers  and our utilization decreased slightly in the fourth quarter 
utilization and leasing demand for our refrigerated containers remained strong in leasing demand for special containers remained steady while leasing demand for tank containers was strong 
utilization for our chassis product line improved due to a better supply demand balance for chassis in the united states 
the following tables set forth our equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below average utilization year ended december  quarter ended december  quarter ended september  quarter ended june  quarter ended march  ending utilization december  september  june  march  utilization is computed by dividing our total units on lease in ceu s by the total units in our fleet in ceu s excluding new units not yet leased and off hire units designated for sale 
effective for this filing  we have changed our utilization calculation to be based on ceu s and to exclude off hire units designated for sale 
this new method provides a better indicator of the performance of our leasable fleet because it gives greater weight to more expensive equipment types and it does not include those off hire containers that have been designated for sale 
in addition  we believe our utilization calculated under this new methodology more closely conforms to those used by our publicly traded competitors 
utilization for all of the periods shown above has been recalculated using this new methodology 
utilization under the former methodology would have been as of december   and the average for the quarter and year ended december  would have been and  respectively 
average lease rates 
average lease rates for our dry container product line in increased from the average level in due to the extreme shortage of containers in and concerns about a recurring shortage in  container manufacturers were able to charge a premium for new container production for much of and  and new dry container prices and market leasing rates were historically high 
as a result  our average dry container lease rates increased throughout as new containers and sale leaseback containers were placed on lease and as certain existing leases were re priced 
however  during the latter part of  new dry container prices decreased from peak levels reached earlier in the year 
in  average lease rates for refrigerated containers were higher than in  while average lease rates for special containers were higher 
the increase in average lease rates for our refrigerated containers during was primarily due to the expiration during of lease rate concessions provided to certain customers in for lease extension transactions  and partially offset by new units going on hire at lease rates slightly below our portfolio average 
the increase in average lease rates for our special containers was due to new special containers going onto leases with rates higher than our portfolio average 

table of contents equipment disposals 
during  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our used containers compared to a million gain in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices  partially offset by lower selling volumes 
average selling prices for dry containers during climbed over above the level  driven by the tight overall supply demand balance for containers at the beginning of the year  very low drop off volumes of older used containers during the first half of  and the high prices for new containers 
however  used dry container selling prices started to trend down toward the end of as concerns about a peak season container shortage passed and drop off volumes increased 
we expect further moderation of used container selling prices as we head into for the year ended december  we sold approximately  teu s of our owned containers  or of our owned equipment fleet as of the beginning of the year 
this disposal rate is below the annual long term average disposal rate we expect given the year expected useful life of our containers 
our inventory of disposal containers began the year at a low level and container drop off volumes in were exceptionally low 
equipment ownership expenses 
during  our ownership expenses  which consist of depreciation and interest expense  increased by million or compared to tal purchased a large volume of new containers during the latter half of and first half of  and as a result  the average net book value of our revenue earning assets increased by over the course of the year 
depreciation expense increased by million or in compared to  though the change would have been million or without the change in residual value estimates made effective october  interest expense increased million or in due to an increase in our average outstanding debt  partially offset by a decrease in our average effective interest rate 
our average debt balance increased mainly due to new equipment purchases in and the second half of our average effective interest rate decreased by during mainly due to the renewal of our asset backed warehouse facility at a lower interest rate  the termination of several interest rate swap contracts with higher interest rates and shorter maturities  and the replacement of those swaps with longer term swap contracts that have lower fixed rates 
credit performance 
our credit performance remained strong in  and we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of million 
however  our concern about credit risk is heightened again due to the difficult conditions our shipping line customers are facing and the sizable financial losses many of them reported in in  excess vessel capacity placed severe pressure on freight rates on the major east west trade lanes 
effective vessel capacity increased significantly in due to deliveries of new vessels and the re introduction of ships that had been laid up in and containerized trade growth was not large enough in to fully utilize this increased vessel capacity 
higher fuel prices combined with the drop in freight rates to squeeze the profitability of our customers  and many of them reported large losses during the year 
we anticipate that our customers will continue to experience difficult operating conditions during and are likely to continue experiencing large financial losses 
vessel over capacity is generally expected to continue to pressure freight rates for some time  especially on the major east west trade lanes  due to the large number of orders placed for very large container ships 
as a result  we face an increased likelihood that larger customers might default on our lease agreements and expect the potential for credit losses to remain high 
operating expenses 
our direct operating expenses were million in  compared to million in our direct operating expenses decreased in mainly due to lower storage and repair costs  which resulted from our high utilization throughout the year 
our administrative expenses 
table of contents increased to million in from million in  primarily due to increased incentive compensation 
while we generally expect most of our operating expenses to remain low for some time relative to our historical averages  we are concerned that operating expenses for our refrigerated container product line could increase in due to problems with contaminated refrigerants 
in  the use of counterfeit refrigerant gas has led to the explosion of several refrigeration machines  none of which are owned by tal 
three of these incidents have resulted in personal injury or death  and in all cases  the counterfeit gas has led to irreparable damage to the refrigeration machines 
refrigeration machine manufacturers are currently working with our customers and our depot vendors to develop and implement tests for the presence of this counterfeit refrigerant gas 
tal s leases are effectively triple net leases that require our customers to properly maintain and service our containers when they are on hire  and to pay for damages to our containers when they are returned 
however  we anticipate that we may face increased costs associated with the testing procedures  as well as possibly extended downtime for refrigerated containers returned by our customers 
dividends we paid the following quarterly dividends during the years ended december  and on our issued and outstanding common stock record date payment date aggregate payment per share payment december  december  million september  september  million june  june  million march  march  million december  december  million september  september  million june  june  million march  march  million while most of our dividends have historically been treated as a non taxable return of capital  based on our results  a portion of tal s dividends paid in will be taxable to tal shareholders with the balance treated as a return of capital 
the taxability of the dividends to tal shareholders does not impact our corporate tax position 
investors should consult with a tax advisor to determine the proper tax treatment of these distributions 
treasury stock there were no material purchases of treasury stock during the years ended december  and during  we paid million to repurchase nearly million shares of our common stock

further  we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the us securities and exchange commission that enables us to issue additional public debt and equity securities up to approximately million 
the registration statement expires on december  as of december   major committed cash outflows in the next months include million of committed but unpaid capital expenditures and million of scheduled principal payments on our existing debt facilities 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities and existing cash  proceeds from the sale of our leasing equipment  principal payments on our finance lease receivables and availability under our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet our obligations over the next months 
at december   our outstanding indebtedness was comprised of the following amounts in millions current amount outstanding current maximum borrowing level asset backed securitization term notes abs term loan facilities asset backed warehouse facility revolving credit facility capital lease obligations total debt the maximum commitment levels depicted in the chart above may not reflect the actual availability under all of the credit facilities 
certain of these facilities are governed by borrowing bases that limit borrowing capacity to an established percentage of relevant assets 
as of december  we had million of debt outstanding on facilities with fixed interest rates 
these fixed rate facilities are scheduled to mature between and  had a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average remaining term of years as of december  as of december  we had  million of debt outstanding on facilities with interest rates based on floating rate indices primarily libor 
these floating rate facilities are scheduled to mature between and  had a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average remaining term of years as of december  we economically hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate borrowings by entering into interest rate swap contracts that convert a significant portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps in place with a total notional 
table of contents value of million 
as of december   the weighted average fixed leg interest rate for these interest rate swap contracts was and the weighted average remaining term was years 
asset backed securitization term notes our asset backed securitization abs facilities have been the primary funding source used to finance our existing container fleet and new container purchases 
under the facilities  our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries issue asset backed notes 
the issuance of asset backed notes is the primary business objective of those subsidiaries 
our borrowings under the abs facilities amortize in equal monthly installments 
the borrowing capacity under the abs facilities is determined by applying an advance rate against the sum of the net book values of designated eligible containers and accounts receivable for sold containers not aged more than days plus of restricted cash 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to either or of original equipment cost  depending on the type of equipment 
advance rates under the abs facilities range from to 
we are required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in designated bank accounts equal to either five or nine months of interest expense depending on the type of facility 
term loan facilities we utilize our term loan facilities as an important funding source for the purchase of containers and other equipment 
the term loan facilities generally amortize in monthly installments 
the borrowing capacity under the term loan facilities is determined by applying an advance rate in the range of to against the net book values of designated eligible containers  which is determined under the terms of each facility 
asset backed warehouse facility on august   one of our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries renewed the asset backed warehouse facility 
under the renewed facility  the maximum borrowing capacity is million  and the period in which funds are available on a revolving basis has been extended to august  if the facility is not refinanced on or before that date  the outstanding notes issued under the facility will convert to term notes with a maturity date of august  the term notes amortize on a level basis over the four year term period to of the outstanding balance 
the borrowing capacity under the asset backed warehouse facility is determined by applying the advance rate of against the sum of the net book values of designated eligible containers and accounts receivable for sold containers not outstanding more than days plus of restricted cash 
the net book value for purposes of calculating our borrowing capacity is the original equipment cost depreciated over years to either or of original equipment cost depending on the type of equipment 
we are required to maintain restricted cash balances on deposit in a designated bank account equal to three months of interest expense 
revolving credit facility on november   we renewed the revolving credit facility 
under the renewed facility  the borrowing capacity remains million and the maturity date has been extended to november  we are required to maintain unencumbered assets equivalent to of the maximum commitment 

table of contents capital lease obligations we have entered into a series of lease transactions with various financial institutions to finance chassis and containers 
each lease is accounted for as a capital lease  with interest expense recognized on a level yield basis over the period preceding early purchase options  if any  which is generally five to ten years from the transaction date 
debt covenants we are subject to certain financial covenants under our debt agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
below are the primary financial covenants to which we are subject minimum earnings before interest and taxes ebit to cash interest expense  minimum tangible net worth tnw  and maximum indebtedness to tnw 
non gaap measures we rely primarily on our results measured in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in evaluating our business 
ebit  cash interest expense  tnw  and indebtedness are non gaap financial measures defined in our debt agreements that are used to determine our compliance with certain covenants contained in our debt agreements and should not be used as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
however  we believe that the inclusion of this non gaap information provides additional information to investors regarding our debt covenant compliance 
minimum ebit to cash interest expense for the purpose of this covenant  ebit is calculated based on the cumulative sum of our earnings for the last four quarters excluding income taxes  interest expense  amortization  net gain or loss on interest rate swaps and certain non cash charges 
cash interest expense is calculated based on interest expense adjusted to exclude interest income  amortization of deferred financing costs  and the difference between current and prior period interest expense accruals 
minimum ebit to cash interest expense is calculated on a consolidated basis and for certain of our wholly owned special purpose entities spes  whose primary activity is to issue asset backed notes 
ebit for each of our spes is calculated based on the net earnings generated by the assets pledged as collateral for the underlying debt issued 
the actual ebit to cash interest expense ratio for each spe may differ depending on the specific net earnings associated with those pledged assets 
as of december   the required and actual consolidated ebit to cash interest expense ratio and ebit to cash interest expense ratio for each of our spes that has issued debt under facilities that have a borrowing capacity of approximately million or greater were as follows entity issuer minimum ebit to cash interest expense ratio actual ebit to cash interest expense ratio consolidated tal advantage i  llc tal advantage ii  llc tal advantage iii  llc tal advantage iv  llc 
table of contents minimum tnw and maximum indebtedness to tnw covenants we are required to meet consolidated minimum tnw and maximum indebtedness to tnw covenants 
for the purposes of calculating these covenants  all amounts are based on the consolidated balance sheet of tal international group  inc tnw is calculated as total tangible assets less total indebtedness  which includes equipment purchases payable and  in certain cases  includes the fair value of derivative instruments liability 
for the majority of our debt facilities  the required minimum tnw is calculated as million plus of cumulative net income or loss since january  as of december   the required minimum tnw and actual tnw for each of our spes was million and million  respectively 
as of december   the required and actual maximum indebtedness to tnw ratios for each of our debt facilities that have a borrowing capacity of approximately million or greater was as follows entity issuer maximum indebtedness to tnw ratio actual indebtedness to tnw ratio tal advantage i  llc tal advantage ii  llc tal advantage iii  llc tal advantage iv  llc as of december   our outstanding debt on facilities with borrowing capacity of approximately million or greater was approximately  million 
failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default under the related credit agreements and could result in the acceleration of our outstanding debt if we were unable to obtain a waiver from our creditors

contractual obligations we are party to various operating leases and are obligated to make payments related to our long term borrowings 
we are also obligated under various commercial commitments  including obligations to our equipment manufacturers 
our equipment purchase obligations are in the form of conventional accounts payable  and are satisfied from cash flows from operating and or long term financing activities 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  does not include amounts potentially due under guarantees  as amounts  if any  are indeterminable contractual obligations by twelve month periods ending december  contractual obligations total and thereafter dollars in millions total debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases mainly facilities purchase obligations equipment purchases payable equipment purchase commitments total contractual obligations amounts include actual and estimated interest 
for floating rate debt  we have estimated interest based on december  rates and the net effect of our interest rate swaps 
amounts include interest 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically range for a period of three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advanced billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire  but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire for a given period 
revenue for customers where collection is not reasonably assured is deferred and recognized when the amounts are received 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification no 
 revenue recognition asc  we recognize billings to customers for damages and certain other operating costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
as principal  we are responsible for fulfillment of the services  supplier selection and service specifications  and we have ultimate responsibility to pay the supplier for the services whether or not we collect the amount billed to the lessee 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include a bargain purchase option that enables the lessee to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
equipment trading revenues and expense equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of equipment purchased for resale and are recognized as units are sold and delivered to the customer 
the related expenses represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
leasing equipment in general  the company purchases new equipment from equipment manufacturers for the purpose of leasing such equipment to customers 
the company also purchases used equipment with the 
table of contents intention of selling such equipment 
used units are typically purchased with an existing lease in place or were previously owned by one of the company s third party owner investors 
leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives and residual values of the company s leasing equipment are based on historical disposal experience 
the company reviews its depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in its depreciation policies  useful lives of its equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
as of december   the estimated useful lives and residual values of the company s leasing equipment are as follows useful lives years residual values dry container units to  refrigerated container units  to  special container units to  tank container units chassis effective october   the company increased the estimated residual values used in its equipment depreciation policy 
prior to october   the company s estimated residual value ranges for dry  refrigerated and special containers were to   to  and to  respectively 
costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
the company charges to expense inspection costs on new equipment and repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets at the time the costs are incurred  and includes these costs in direct operating expenses 
if indicators of impairment are present  a determination is made as to whether the carrying value of the company s fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
leasing equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recovered 
key indicators of impairment on leasing equipment include  among other factors  a sustained decrease in operating profitability  a sustained decrease in utilization  or indications of technological obsolescence 
when testing for impairment  leasing equipment is generally grouped by equipment type  and is tested separately from other groups of assets and liabilities 
some of the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine future undiscounted cash flows and the measurement for impairment are the remaining useful life  expected utilization  expected future lease rates and expected disposal prices of the equipment 
the company considers the assumptions on expected utilization and the remaining useful life to have the greatest impact on its estimate of future undiscounted cash flows 
these estimates are principally based on the company s historical experience and management s judgment of market conditions 
an allowance is provided through the provision for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of the net book value of the units on lease to certain customers that are considered to be non performing  which the company believes it will not ultimately recover 
the percentage is developed based on historical experience 
equipment held for sale when leasing equipment is returned off lease  we make a determination of whether to repair and re lease the equipment or sell the equipment 
at the time we determine that equipment will be sold  
table of contents we reclassify the appropriate amounts previously recorded as leasing equipment to equipment held for sale 
in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 property  plant and equipment asc  equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its estimated fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell  or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within days 
subsequent changes to the asset s fair value  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments may not exceed the equipment s carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment charge and are included in net gain loss on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as a gain loss on sale of leasing equipment  and cash flows associated with the disposal of equipment held for sale are classified as cash flows from investing activities 
equipment held for resale trading activity on an opportunistic basis  we purchase used equipment with markings or specifications different from our own equipment for purposes of reselling it for a net profit 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as equipment held for sale when the timeframe between when the equipment is purchased and when it is sold is expected to be short  generally less than one year 
cash flows associated with equipment purchased for resale having a short expected holding period are classified as operating cash flows 
equipment purchased for resale is reported as leasing equipment when the timeframe between when the equipment is purchased and when it is sold is expected to be one year or greater 
cash flows associated with equipment purchased for resale having a long expected holding period are classified as investing cash flows 
equipment trading revenues represent the proceeds from the sale of this equipment  while equipment trading expense includes the cost of equipment sold  any costs to sell such equipment  including administrative costs  and costs associated with the inventory such as storage and handling charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is updated on a regular basis and is based upon a review of the collectability of our receivables 
this review considers the risk profile of the customer  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in our receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to provide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in assessing our ability to realize 
table of contents deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if applicable  we accrue income tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions by evaluating whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense 
deferred financing costs deferred financing costs represent the fees incurred in connection with our debt obligations  and are amortized using the effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the related obligation  depending on the type of debt obligation to which they relate 
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off when the related debt obligations are refinanced or extinguished prior to maturity  and are determined to be an extinguishment of debt 
goodwill we account for goodwill in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc 
asc requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
in connection with the acquisition that occurred in  we recorded million of goodwill 
management determined that the company has two reporting units  equipment leasing and equipment trading  and allocated million and million  respectively  to each reporting unit 
the annual impairment test is conducted by comparing the company s carrying amount  to the fair value of the company using a market capitalization approach 
market capitalization of the entity is compared to the carrying value of the entity since virtually all of the goodwill is allocated to  and nearly all of the market capitalization is attributable to  the equipment leasing reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the entity exceeds its market capitalization  then a second step would be performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
the determination of implied fair value of goodwill would require management to compare the estimated fair value of the reporting units to the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting units 
any excess fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
our annual review of goodwill  conducted in the fourth quarter of  indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative diclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk we enter into interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our floating rate debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 

table of contents the primary external risk of our interest rate swap contracts is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
all derivative agreements are with highly rated financial institutions 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative contract to monitor counterparty credit exposure 
as of december   we had in place total interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our borrowings under debt facilities with floating interest rates as summarized below total notional amount at december  weighted average fixed leg interest rate at december  weighted average remaining term million years changes in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as net gains or losses on interest rate swaps as we do not apply hedge accounting treatment for these contracts 
during  our net loss on interest rate swaps totaled million  compared to million in since approximately of our variable rate debt is economically hedged using interest rate swap contracts  our interest expense is not significantly affected by changes in interest rates 
however  a basis point increase in the interest rates on our floating rate debt primarily libor would result in an increase of approximately million in interest expense on the portion of our floating rate debt that is not economically hedged 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the large majority of our leases and obligations  and most of our revenues and expenses in and were denominated in us dollars 
however we pay our us staff in local currencies  and certain of our direct operating expenses and disposal transactions for our older containers are structured in foreign currencies 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of million 
these losses resulted primarily from fluctuations in exchange rates related to our euro and pound sterling transactions and related assets and liabilities 
in april  we entered into foreign currency rate swap agreements to exchange euros for us dollars based on expected payments under our euro denominated finance lease receivables 
the foreign currency rate swap agreements expire in april as of december  and  the fair value of these agreements were million and million  respectively  and are reported as assets in fair value of derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets
