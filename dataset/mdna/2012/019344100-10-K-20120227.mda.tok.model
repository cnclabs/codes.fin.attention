table of contents part i item business allied nevada gold corp 
is a us based gold producer focused on mining  development  and exploration properties in the state of nevada 
in this report  allied nevada  the company  our and we refer to allied nevada gold corp 
and its subsidiaries 
the company s operating mine  the hycroft mine  is a past producing open pit gold and silver heap leach operation located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
allied nevada restarted the mine operations in and is expanding its oxide and sulfide mineralization processing capabilities to provide staged increases of production through  which are intended to increase annual production to over  ounces of gold and approximately million ounces of silver beginning the hycroft mine  which resides on an aggregate land position of approximately square miles  is currently an open pit  run of mine and crushed ore heap leach gold mine that also produces silver as a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
the hycroft mine hosts a proven and probable mineral reserve of million ounces of gold and million ounces of silver 
mining is currently carried out by open pit methods with a typical drill  blast  load  and haul cycle from two pits the brimstone and cut pits 
currently  the majority of the ore grade material placed on the leach pad is run of mine with a small percentage being selectively crushed based on ore type and grade 
the company is currently implementing a two stage expansion project that is intended to produce a six fold growth in gold production at the mine by the first stage of the expansion began in and involves increasing the mining and heap leaching rate of oxide and transitional material utilizing larger capacity mining equipment and expanding the processing facilities 
the mining equipment required for both stages of the expansion project has been arriving at site since late and will continue to be delivered through in  a gyratory crushing facility is scheduled to be constructed to improve recovery of gold and silver from ore 
the second stage of the expansion involves constructing a mill and flotation plant to further improve metal recoveries from oxide and transitional ores and allow for processing of sulfide ore 
the milling operation is expected to be operational in in addition to the hycroft mine  allied nevada owns of the hasbrouck  three hills  mountain view  wildcat projects  and the pony creek elliot dome project 
allied nevada also has a joint venture on the maverick springs project  and the exploration rights to approximately other exploration properties 
the company began an aggressive exploration campaign on hasbrouck in to follow up on encouraging results received through drilling 
the company successfully completed the drilling program with the discovery of a number of high grade zones and intends to complete an initial economic evaluation in the first quarter of during  the company will continue to advance the project towards the identification of mineral reserves

please see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to our business segments 
principal products allied nevada sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver during we generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer 
we recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable  the gold has been delivered  the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
for   and   and  respectively  of our total revenues were attributable to gold 
most of our revenue arises from the sale of refined gold in the international market 
the end product at our gold operations  however  is generally dor bars 
dor is an alloy consisting of gold  silver and other metals 
dor is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of pure gold 
under the terms of our refining agreements  the dor bars are refined for a fee  and our share of the refined gold and the separately recovered silver are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers 
during  our gold revenues were more than times our silver revenues 
as such  we consider gold to be a principal product and silver to be a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
our future expansion plans will increase the proportion of our total revenues from silver revenue 
we will continue to monitor total revenues to determine the point at which silver is then characterized as a co product of our hycroft mine 

table of contents gold uses 
gold has two main categories of use fabrication and investment 
fabricated gold has a variety of end uses  including jewelry  electronics  dentistry  industrial and decorative uses  medals  medallions and official coins 
gold investors buy gold bullion  official coins and jewelry 
gold supply 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw down of existing stocks of gold held by governments  financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
based on public information  total annual world gold supply in decreased year over year to approximately  tonnes of gold million ounces 
for the years and  global mine production has  on average  represented approximately of the total annual gold supply 
although mine supply has increased year over year  the total supply of gold decreased due to lower recycling activity and lower central bank purchases 
gold demand in was driven by investment of total demand  technology of total demand and jewelry of total demand 
notable changes in demand include increases in investment and jewelry demand from china offset by decreases in india 
gold prices 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by many factors beyond our control  such as the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
the following table presents the annual high  low and average afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past ten years  expressed in us dollars per ounce  on the london bullion market 
gold price usd per ounce on the london bullion market year high low average source london metal exchange on february   the afternoon fixing price for gold on the london bullion market was  per ounce 
business strategy our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the operation of the hycroft mine  the exploration and development of our mineral properties  and through strategic partnerships 
to achieve this goal  our business plan focuses on three strategic areas hycroft mine  mine operations  hycroft expansion project  hycroft exploration and mine development drilling program  advanced exploration properties  and mergers and acquisitions 
hycroft mine mine operations the hycroft mine is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada along the border of humboldt and pershing counties  and covers approximately square miles of mineral rights 
the mine can be accessed by various routes year round 
however  primary access is by an all weather  maintained gravel road from the town of winnemucca 
our operating objective at the hycroft mine is to mine the deposit in a profitable  safe  and environmentally responsible manner 
to attain this goal  we have focused on recruiting and retaining experienced executives  managers  and employees 
our team has extensive experience in managing and operating mines utilizing the specific mining and processing methods used by the company 
we believe this team has identified the appropriate technologies and developed the appropriate production management  health and safety programs and environmental management  monitoring  and protection programs 

table of contents operations in  the mine moved million tons of material  including million tons of ore that was placed on the leach pad at average grades of ounces per ton opt gold and opt silver  placing  contained ounces of gold  ounces of recoverable gold and  contained ounces of silver  ounces of recoverable silver 
the mine completed a million square foot expansion of its brimstone leach pad in work began on the million square foot capacity lewis leach pad  located directly adjacent to the brimstone pad  which is currently expected to be completed in the first quarter of additional pumps were installed increasing solution flow to the leach pads and the solution processing capacity of the merrill crowe plant was increased from  gallons per minute gpm to  gpm 
hycroft expansion project the company is currently expanding hycroft operations to include increasing the mining rate  improving the metal recovery potential with crushing and ultimately milling processes and adding the potential to process sulfide material 
the hycroft expansion project expansion project is the combination of the following three related projects which have been previously announced the company began implementing an accelerated heap leach mine plan in mid with a goal of increasing the mining rate utilizing a larger capacity mining fleet and upgrading existing oxide processing facilities 
in  the company decided to accelerate construction of a large gyratory crushing unit to be utilized in the heap leach operation 
in  the company completed a positive feasibility study on the hycroft mill expansion option 
under this project  a milling process would supplement the heap leach operations 
the mill will process the higher grade fractions of the oxide mineralization and all of the transitional and sulfide mineralization 
the board has approved the capital expenditures to complete detailed engineering to construct the mill and the ordering of long lead time items critical to the proposed construction timelines 
upon completion of the detailed engineering  the board expects to approve the construction of the mill 
the current expansion project from this point forward is best described in the following four related activities mine expansion 
the current expansion project requires the company to increase its mining rate from the million tons of material mined in to million tons of material by the end of and ultimately to more than million tons of material once the mill is constructed 
this expansion stage involves purchasing larger capacity haul trucks  shovels and production drills along with ancillary mining equipment 
by the end of  a significant portion of the larger mobile mining fleet was in operation including two smaller and two larger capacity hydraulic shovels  seven ton haul trucks and additional support equipment 
leach pad expansion 
while the mill is being built  the increased oxide mineralization mined will be processed on leachpads 
to accommodate the oxide ore being milled  the existing leach pad system needs to be expanded 
the addition of the gyratory crusher is intended to benefit the ultimate recovery of gold from the leach pads 
in  the merrill crowe plant was expanded to increase the solution processing capacity from  gallons per minute to  gallons per minute 
the brimstone leach pad expansion was completed increasing the pad size to million square feet 
in addition  preparation of the lewis leach pad  located directly adjacent to the brimstone pad  began and is expected to add million square feet of leach pad space in early to date  the primary  secondary and tertiary units have been ordered including a gyratory crusher  cone crushers and screens 
it is anticipated that the gyratory crushing plant will become operational mid the effect of this implementation is intended to increase annual gold production to approximately  ounces by the end of mill construction 
based on the completed feasibility study  the economics of the project could be increased by constructing a mill to process the higher grade oxide mineralization along with the transitional and sulfide mineralization 
the company is currently completing the detailed engineering and has begun ordering long lead time items critical to the construction schedule 
to date  the major long lead components of the grinding circuit semi autogenous grinding mills and ball mills have been ordered and are on schedule to arrive as per the construction timeline 
infrastructure 
the future expansion plans require the company to upgrade the infrastructure at the hycroft mine 
major infrastructure items include the upgrade of the power transmission and distribution system to handle the milling demands and the construction of a rail siding 
the initial capital cost estimate for the expansion project is expected to be billion 
as of february   allied nevada had spent or committed million  which is below the feasibility estimate for this equipment and represents approximately of the total capital expenditures estimate 
all equipment pricing is firm and includes freight and taxes 
in the case of the mining equipment  the pricing also includes on site assembly and commissioning 
hycroft exploration and mine development drilling program in  allied nevada successfully completed its drill campaign holes totaling  feet with a focus on metallurgical and geotechnical samples at central  brimstone  and vortex  geotechnical drilling on the october reserve pit  step out drilling at 
table of contents central and brimstone  and condemnation work at the proposed west and south dump and south leach pad areas 
exploration drilling is intended to provide additional metallurgical and geotechnical samples  step out  and condemnation drilling at the proposed north dump 
the proposed expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan will require us to obtain all permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
for further discussions concerning these programs  see part i item properties operating properties hycroft mine hycroft mine exploration 
advanced exploration properties our advanced exploration properties portfolio consists of the following six advanced properties hasbrouck  mountain view  maverick springs a joint venture interest with silver standard resources inc silver standard or ssri  three hills  wildcat  and pony creek elliot dome 
the company commenced drilling activities on hasbrouck in  and continued drilling until december of  in order to further identify and delineate the gold mineralization previously identified at the property 
the company intends to publish an updated estimate of mineralized material and an initial economic evaluation in for hasbrouck 
exploration activities at hasbrouck mountain in included drilling  feet in forty three diamond drill core holes core holes or core drilling  and  feet in seventy two reverse circulation rotary holes for a total of  feet 
an additional reverse circulation rotary holes totaling  feet were drilled south of the hasbrouck mountain within the larger hasbrouck claim block 
in  additional claims were located and acquired 
the company is developing exploration programs at other advanced exploration properties for with the goal of confirming or establishing mineralization at these properties 
for further discussions concerning our exploration properties  please see information concerning each property under part i item properties 
other exploration properties the company has approximately other exploration properties in the state of nevada including numerous patented claims throughout the state 
the company intends to pursue strategic options for these exploration properties that could include development through exploration programs  joint ventures  royalty agreements  or the sale or release of the properties 
during  the company completed drill holes  totaling approximately  feet  at the illipah project 
mergers and acquisitions we routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities 
our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near term production with a secondary focus on other resource based opportunities 
potential acquisition targets could include private and public companies or individual properties 
although our preference would be for acquisition candidates located in the united states  allied nevada may consider from time to time opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptably low 
financial information included in this document this annual report on form k form k includes financial and other information for the years ended december  prior to may   we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold corp 
vista 
consistent with our past filings  the financial statements  related discussion and analysis and other financial information in this report were prepared as it related to the subsidiaries of vista that held nevada based mining properties and related assets that were transferred to allied nevada as part of the arrangement agreement

to the extent necessary  allied nevada uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of its project evaluation drill program management  expansion and feasibility studies  due diligence  acquisition initiatives  corporate governance and property management 
competition allied nevada competes with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties 
there is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities  some of which are with companies having substantially greater financial resources than allied nevada 
as a result  allied nevada may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices 
allied nevada also competes with other mining companies for skilled employees and from time to time certain production inputs have been in short supply 
shortages of production supplies rarely lead to operational issues  but would require us to either substitute with lower quality supplies or to ship these supplies from longer distances 
these substitutions and changes would therefore result in minor production inefficiencies and or additional costs 
to date  we have not experienced any material shortages in production inputs of this nature 
management of allied nevada believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market 
allied nevada does not have any major customers for its gold production that would adversely affect the company should such customers fail

government regulation of mining related activities property interests and mining claims our exploration activities are conducted in the state of nevada 
mineral interests may be owned in nevada by a the united states  b the state itself  or c private parties 
where prospective mineral properties are owned by private parties  or by the state  some type of property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for allied nevada to explore or develop such property 
generally  these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty  usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production 
other forms of acquisition agreements are options to purchase and joint venture agreements 
where prospective mineral properties are held by the united states  mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land 
if the statutory requirements for the location of a mining claim are met  the locator obtains a valid possessory right  subject to the paramount title of the united states  to develop and produce minerals from the claim conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs 
federal unpatented mining claims must be maintained through filing notices of intent to maintain the claims with the county and the completion of annual assessment work or  since  payment of federal maintenance fees 
the right can be transferred as prescribed under law and  provided that the locator is able to prove the discovery of valuable  locatable minerals on the claims and to meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims  the claim locator would have the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the claim from the federal government 
the right to pursue a patent  however  has been subject to a moratorium since october  through federal legislation restricting the us bureau of land management blm from accepting any new mineral patent applications 
additionally  proposed federal legislation has been introduced to amend the federal mining law pursuant to which  if adopted  would  among other changes  remove the right to obtain a patent and replace the claim location process with a leasing program 

table of contents mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests 
additionally  mining claims are self initiated and self maintained and therefore  possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests 
it is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and  therefore  it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim 
if the validity of a patented mining claim is challenged by the blm or the us forest service on the grounds that mineralization has not been demonstrated  the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located thereon 
such a challenge might be raised when a patent application is submitted  when the government seeks to include the land in an area to be dedicated to another use  or when a party files a permit application or plan of operation to develop the mining claims 
reclamation we are required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed 
these reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans  which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
allied nevada s principal reclamation liability is at the hycroft mine 
at december   we have posted reclamation bonds totaling million 
these reclamation bonds are supported by an insurance backed financial assurance program and a surety bond 
please see note restricted cash to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
in january   the reclamation surety for the hycroft mine was increased to a total of million 
this increase covers the regulatory requirement to update the cost estimate to account for changes in current labor and equipment rates and closure assumptions 
government regulation mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the united states  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
we have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses  permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our mining exploration and other programs 
we believe that allied nevada is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in nevada and the united states 
we are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to allied nevada with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
environmental regulation our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
these laws are continually changing and  in general  are becoming more restrictive 
it is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment 
we believe that allied nevada s operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in nevada  where we operate currently  or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future  could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and or reclamation costs 
although we are unable to predict what additional legislation  if any  might be proposed or enacted  additional regulatory requirements could adversely impact the profitability levels of our projects 
our past and future activities in the united states may cause us to be subject to liability under various federal laws  including the following federal and state acts described below 
these are intended as a brief overview of certain material laws and regulations we are subject to and described herein and is not intended to be a comprehensive treatment of the subject matter 
us federal laws the comprehensive environmental  response  compensation  and liability act cercla  and comparable state statutes  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
it is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions  demands for reimbursement for government incurred cleanup costs  or natural resource damages  or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state statutes  govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance  as well as requirements for corrective actions 
cercla  rcra and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration  mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed 
the clean air act  as amended  restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including mining and processing activities 
our mining operations may produce air emissions  including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment  storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment  which are subject to review  monitoring and or control requirements under the clean air act and state air quality laws 
new facilities may be required to 
table of contents obtain permits before work can begin  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
in addition  permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions  including issuance of permits to mining facilities such as hycroft mine  and assessing alternatives to those actions 
if a proposed action could significantly affect the environment  the agency must prepare a detailed statement known as an environmental impact statement eis 
the us environmental protection agency  other federal agencies  and any interested third parties will review and comment on the scoping of the eis and the adequacy of and findings set forth in the draft and final eis 
this process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts  which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project 
the clean water act cwa  and comparable state statutes  impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the environmental protection agency epa or an analogous state agency 
the cwa regulates storm water mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities 
such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run off from its operations 
the cwa and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
the cwa and comparable state statutes provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
the safe drinking water act sdwa and the underground injection control uic program promulgated thereunder  regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells 
epa directly administers the uic program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state 
the program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well 
violation of these regulations and or contamination of groundwater by mining related activities may result in fines  penalties  and remediation costs  among other sanctions and liabilities under the swda and state laws 
in addition  third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies  property damages  and bodily injury 
nevada state laws at the state level  mining operations in nevada are also regulated by the nevada department of conservation and natural resources  division of environmental protection 
nevada state law requires the hycroft mine to hold nevada water pollution control permits  which dictate operating controls and closure and post closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water 
in addition  we are required to hold nevada reclamation permits 
these permits mandate concurrent and post mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation 
we have set up a provision for our reclamation bond at the hycroft mine 
if we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work in the future  our financial position could be adversely affected or our posted bonds may be insufficient 
other nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations 
any changes to these laws and regulations could have an impact on our financial performance and results of operations by  for example  requiring changes to operating constraints  technical criteria  fees or surety requirements 
during   and  there were no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by allied nevada 
allied nevada did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during   or and does not expect to incur any such expenditures in mine safety and health administration regulations allied nevada considers health  safety and environmental stewardship to be a core value for the company and received a sentinels of safety award for the year 
allied nevada has a mandatory mine safety and health program including employee and contractor training  risk management  workplace inspection  emergency response  accident investigation and program auditing 
the company considers this program to be essential at all levels to ensure that employees and the company conduct themselves in an environment of exemplary health  safety and environmental governance 
our operations and exploration properties are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of the mine act 
msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the mine act 
following passage of the mine improvement and new emergency response act of  msha significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations 
the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also generally increased in recent years 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act  which became effective in july  requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the exchange act 
the company has provided disclosure as

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this form k before deciding to invest or to continue holding your investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us or otherwise associated with an investment in our common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we have attempted to identify the major factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results 
if any of the following risks actually happen  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
see note regarding forward looking statements above 
the market prices of gold and silver are volatile 
low gold and silver prices could result in decreased revenues  decreased net income or losses and decreased cash flows  and may negatively affect our business 
gold and silver are commodities 
their prices fluctuate and are affected by many factors beyond our control  including interest rates  expectations regarding inflation  speculation  currency values  central bank activities  governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles  global and regional demand and production  political and economic conditions and other factors 
the prices of gold and silver on the london bullion market on december  were  per ounce for gold and per ounce for silver 
the prices of gold and silver may decline in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in gold or silver price would adversely impact our revenues  net income and cash flows  particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold 
in addition  sustained lower gold or silver prices can reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits  or portions of deposits  that have become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold or silver price  reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads  halt or delay the development of new projects  cause us to recognize an impairment to the carrying values of mineral properties  reduce funds available for exploration with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced  and reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices 
the estimation of the ultimate recovery of gold and silver from the hycroft mine  although based on standard industry sampling and estimating methods is subjective 
actual recoveries can be expected to vary from estimations 
the hycroft mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract gold and silver from ore 
the heap leach process extracts gold and silver by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained gold and silver  which are then recovered in metallurgical processes 
we use several integrated steps in the process of extracting gold and silver to estimate the metal content of ore placed on the leach pad 
although we refine our estimates as appropriate at each step in the process  the final amounts are not determined until a third party smelter converts the dor and determines final ounces of gold and silver available for sale 
we then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used throughout the production process 
based on this review  we adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate 
due to the complexity of the estimation process and the number of steps involved  among other things  actual recoveries can vary from estimates  and the amount of the variation could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
each of these factors also applies to any future development of properties not yet in production 
in the case of mines that we may develop in the future  we will not have the benefit of actual experience in our estimates with respect to those mines  and there is a greater likelihood that actual results will vary from the estimates 
reserve and mineralized material calculations are estimates only  and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices  inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of metal in the mining process 
the calculation of mineral reserves  mineralized material and grading are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis  which may prove to be unpredictable 
there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves  resources and corresponding grades 
until reserves and mineralized materials are actually mined and processed  the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only 
in addition  the 
table of contents quantity of reserves and mineralized materials and ore may vary depending on metal prices 
any material change in the quantity of reserves  mineralized materials  mineralization  grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on site conditions or during production 
our gold and silver production may decline  reducing our revenues and negatively impacting our business 
our future gold and silver production may decline as a result of an exhaustion of reserves and possible closure of mines 
it is our business strategy to conduct gold and silver exploratory activities at the hycroft mine and the hasbrouck property and to consider the acquisition of gold and silver mining properties and businesses or reserves that possess minable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in the near future 
we can provide no assurance that our gold and silver production in the future will not decline 
accordingly  our revenues from the sale of gold and silver may decline  negatively affecting our results of operations 
our ability to find and acquire new mineral properties and our prospects for the future growth of our business are uncertain 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves  we are continually seeking to replace and expand our ore reserves 
identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative 
furthermore  we encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing gold and silver 
many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do 
consequently  we may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable 
as a result  our revenues from the sale of gold and silver may decline  resulting in lower income and reduced growth 
to the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions  we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations 
from time to time  we may examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to expand our operations and reported reserves 
the success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms for any such acquisition  obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially the company s stockholders  maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business  and implementing our standards  controls  procedures and policies at the acquired business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully  or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results 
any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
compliance with current and future government regulations may cause us to incur significant costs 
our operations are subject to extensive federal and state legislation governing matters such as mine safety  occupational health  labor standards  prospecting  exploration  production  exports  toxic substances  explosives  management of natural resources  price controls  land use  water use  air emissions  waste disposal  environmental review and taxes 
compliance with this and other legislation could require us to make significant financial outlays 
the enactment of new legislation or more stringent enforcement of current legislation may increase costs  which could have a negative effect on our financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to adapt to these regulatory developments on a timely or cost effective basis 
violations of these laws  regulations and other regulatory requirements could lead to substantial fines  penalties or other sanctions  including possible shut downs of the hycroft mine or future operations  as applicable 
our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require  or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed 
in the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our operations  including in connection with our mining and exploration plans at the hycroft mine and our exploration plan at hasbrouck 
obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time consuming process involving costly undertakings by us 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control  including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority and intervention by third parties in any required environmental review 
we may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations on a timely basis or at all  and the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates 
failure to comply with the terms of our permits may result in injunctions  fines  suspension or revocation of permits and other penalties 
there can be no assurance that we have been or will at all times be in full compliance with all of the terms of our permits or that we have all required permits 
the costs and delays associated 
table of contents with compliance with these permits and with the permitting process could stop us from proceeding with the operation or development of a property or increase the costs of development or production and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may not achieve our production estimates and our operating costs may be higher than our estimates 
we prepare estimates of future production and operating costs for our operations 
we develop our estimates based on  among other things  mining experience  reserve and mineralized material estimates  assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of ores such as hardness and presence or absence of certain metallurgical characteristics and estimated rates and costs of mining and processing 
all of our estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
our actual production may be lower than our production estimates and our actual operating costs may be higher than our operating cost estimates 
we cannot be certain that our future exploration and development activities will be commercially successful 
substantial expenditures are required to further explore our hycroft and hasbrouck properties  to establish reserves and mineralized materials through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and  in the case of new properties or the expansion of our existing projects  to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
we cannot provide assurance that any reserves or mineralized materials discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis 
a number of factors  including costs  actual mineralization  consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity prices  affect successful project development 
the reactivation and efficient operation of processing facilities  the existence of competent operational management  as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development 
there can be no assurance that our exploration and development programs  including the advancement of the hycroft oxide operation  the feasibility study for the hycroft milling project and the preliminary economic assessment of hasbrouck  will result in economically viable mining operations or yield new mineral reserves or mineralized materials 
cost estimates and timing of new projects are uncertain 
the capital expenditures and time required to develop and explore our properties  including the hycroft and hasbrouck properties  are considerable and changes in costs  construction schedules or both  can affect project economics and expected profitability 
there are a number of factors that can affect costs and construction schedules  including  among others availability of labor  power  transportation  equipment  and infrastructure  changes in input commodity prices and labor costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  availability and terms of financing  changes in anticipated tonnage  grade and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed  recovery rates of gold and other metals from the ore  difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of years  delays in completing any environmental review or in obtaining environmental or other government permits  weather and severe climate impacts  and potential delays related to social and community issues 
the positive feasibility study on the hycroft mill expansion project announced by us in october primarily relates to the economic potential of the sulfide mineralization at the hycroft property and is not part of  and should be distinguished from  the current oxide heap leach mining operation 
we do not currently use forward sale or other hedging arrangements to protect against low commodity prices and  as a result  our operating results are exposed to the impact of any significant drop in commodity prices 
we do not currently enter into forward sales or other hedging arrangements to reduce the risk of exposure to volatility in commodity prices 
accordingly  our future operations are exposed to the impact of any significant decrease in commodity prices 
if such prices decrease significantly  we will realize reduced revenues 
while it is not our current intention to enter into forward sales or other hedging arrangements  we are not restricted from entering into such arrangements at a future date 

table of contents mining development  exploration  and processing operations pose risks and costs that may negatively impact our business 
mining development  exploration  and processing operations involve many hazards and uncertainties  including  among others unusual and unexpected rock formations or water conditions  seismic activity  ground or slope failures or underground cave ins  industrial accidents  fires  flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of nature  organized labor disputes or work slow downs  mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems  and the availability of critical materials  equipment and skilled labor 
these occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  our properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining or processing  increased production costs  asset write downs  monetary losses and legal liability  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with our business 
mining  development  exploration and processing operations involve risks which could interrupt or impair our ability to operate as planned  including environmental contamination  metallurgical and other processing problems  organized labor disputes or work slow downs  mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems  and availability of critical materials  equipment and skilled labor 
we cannot be certain that our insurance will cover all of the risks associated with mining and processing or that we will be able to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums  which may increase our costs and decrease our profitability 
we could also become subject to liability for hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high premium costs or commercial impracticality 
such events could result in a prolonged interruption in operations that would have a negative effect on our ability to generate revenues  profits and cash flow 
losses from such events may increase costs and decrease profitability 
we may be adversely affected by challenges relating to slope stability 
our open pit mines get deeper as we mine them  presenting certain geotechnical challenges including the possibility of slope failure 
if we are required to decrease pit slope angles or provide additional road access to prevent such a failure  our stated reserves could be negatively affected 
further  hydrological conditions relating to pit slopes  renewal of material displaced by slope failures and increased stripping requirements could also negatively affect our stated reserves 
we have taken actions in order to maintain slope stability  but we cannot provide any assurances that we will not have to take additional action in the future or that our actions taken to date will be sufficient 
unexpected failure or additional requirements to prevent slope failure may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition  as well as have the effect of diminishing our stated ore reserves 
we face intense competition in the mining industry 
the mining industry is intensely competitive 
as a result of this competition  some of which is with large established mining companies with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours  we may be unable to acquire additional attractive mining claims or financing on terms we consider acceptable  which may adversely impact our growth and development 
this  in turn  may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we also compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees 
if we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees  our exploration and development programs may be slowed down or suspended 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all 
the exploration and development of our properties  including the advancement of the hycroft milling project and the development of the hasbrouck project  as well as any acquisitions we may make  will require significant capital investment 
failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration activity  development or production on any of our properties or consummation of any acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on terms we consider acceptable 

table of contents environmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability 
to the extent we may become subject to environmental liabilities  the payment of such liabilities or the costs that we may incur to remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
if we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem  we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy 
the environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine site impact the cost of remediation and may exceed the financial accruals that have been made for such remediation 
the potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental  health and safety impacts of our past and current operations  which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines  remediation costs  penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions 
substantial costs and liabilities  including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines  are inherent in our operations 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we cannot provide any assurance that any such law  regulation  enforcement or private claim will not have a negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our exploration and development operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations  which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays 
all phases of our operations are subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation  including comprehensive environmental  response  compensation  and liability act cercla  the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  the clean air act caa  the national environmental policy act nepa  the clean water act cwa  and the safe drinking water act sdwa 
these environmental regulations require us to obtain various operating approvals and licenses and also impose standards and controls relating to exploration  development and production activities 
compliance with federal and state regulations could result in delays in beginning or expanding operations  incurring additional costs for cleanup of hazardous substances  payment of penalties for discharge of pollutants  and post mining reclamation and bonding  all of which could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations 
changes in environmental regulations could adversely affect our cost of operations or result in operational delays 
the regulatory environment in which we operate is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
new environmental laws and regulations or changes in existing environmental laws and regulations could have a negative effect on exploration activities  operations  production levels and methods of production 
there is no assurance that future changes in environmental laws and regulations will not adversely affect our projects 
any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by  for example  requiring changes to operating constraints  technical criteria  fees or surety requirements 
there are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry 
any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations 
our mineral properties consist of private mineral rights  leases covering state and private lands  leases of patented mining claims and unpatented mining claims 
many of our mining properties in the united states are unpatented mining claims located on lands administered by the us bureau of land management blm  nevada state office to which we have only possessory title 
because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties  it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims 
these uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery  proper location and posting and marking of boundaries  and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record 
since a substantial portion of all mineral exploration  development and mining in the united states now occurs on unpatented mining claims  this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry 
the present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the right to mine and remove valuable minerals  such as precious and base metals  from the claims conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs 
we also are allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral bearing ores 
however  legal ownership of the land remains with the united states 
we remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the united states or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements 
prior to  a mining claim locator who was able to prove the discovery of valuable  locatable minerals on a mining claim  and to meet all other applicable 
table of contents federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims  had the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the mining claim from the federal government 
the right to pursue a patent  however  has been subject to a moratorium since october  through federal legislation restricting the blm from accepting any new mineral patent applications 
if we do not obtain fee title to our unpatented mining claims  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain compensation in connection with the forfeiture of such claims 
there may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest 
if there are title defects with respect to any properties  we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property 
also  in any such case  the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management s time from ongoing exploration and development programs 
legislation has been proposed that could  if enacted  significantly affect the cost of our operations on our unpatented mining claims 
members of the us congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the mining law of such bills have proposed  among other things  to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims 
such proposed legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims 
a majority of our mining claims are on unpatented claims 
although we cannot predict what legislated royalties might be  the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of our unpatented mining claims and the economics of our existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance 
regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change 
legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us  our venture partners and our suppliers  including costs related to increased energy requirements  capital equipment  environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations 
any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such regulations 
given the emotion  political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with  we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition  operating performance and ability to compete 
furthermore  even without such regulation  increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation 
climate change could have an adverse impact on our cost of operations 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain  and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate 
these may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities  water shortages  changing sea levels and changing temperatures 
these changes in climate could have an impact on the cost of production at our mines and adversely affect the financial performance of our operations 
a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and development operations 
the shortage of such supplies  equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to establish and develop our business 
our development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees  namely  robert buchan  our executive chairman  scott caldwell  our president and chief executive officer  hal kirby  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  and other key employees that we may hire in the future 
although we have entered into employment agreements with key employees  we do not have and currently have no plans to obtain key man insurance with respect to any of our key employees 
as well  we will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons  our development and growth could be significantly curtailed 
some of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies 
some of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining related companies  or may be involved in related pursuits that could present conflicts of interest with their roles at allied nevada 
in the event that any such conflict of interest 
table of contents arises  a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict at a meeting of the directors of the company and to abstain from voting for or against approval of any matter in which such director may have a conflict 
in appropriate cases  we will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which directors  or management  may have a conflict 
future sales of our common stock in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public or private markets  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
as of february    shares of our common stock were outstanding 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  will have on the trading price of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future 
as a result  you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 
our board of directors retains the discretion to change this policy 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under delaware law could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock and the ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws without stockholder approval 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in section collectively  these provisions could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult or could discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities 
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of us and canadian governmental and self regulated organizations  including the us securities and exchange commission  the canadian securities administrators  the nyse amex  the toronto stock exchange  and the financial accounting standards board 
these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
for example  on july   congress passed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
our efforts to comply with the dodd frank act and other new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
joint ventures and other partnerships may expose us to risks 
in the future  we may enter into joint ventures or other partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration  development and production of certain of the properties in which we have an interest 
joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital  merger  division  dissolution  amendments of constituting documents  and the pledge of joint venture assets  which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership 
further  we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties 
any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to third parties  or any disputes with respect to the parties respective rights and obligations  could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial performance  cash flows and the price of the common shares

table of contents item properties we classify our mineral properties into three categories operating properties  advanced exploration properties  and other exploration properties 
operating properties are properties on which the company operates a producing mine 
the hycroft mine  as described below  is our operating property 
advanced exploration properties are properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material 
other exploration properties are those for which insufficient drilling and geologic investigations have been completed to define mineralized materials 
please see below for information about our operating properties  advanced exploration properties  and other exploration properties 
other than the hycroft mine  we cannot be certain that any mineral deposits will be discovered in sufficient quantities and grade to justify commercial operations 
whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors  including the particular attributes of the deposit  metal prices  which are highly cyclical  the cost to extract and process the mineralized material  and government regulations and permitting requirements 
we may be unable to upgrade our mineralized material to proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations and we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop our properties 
estimates of reserves and mineralization herein are subject to the effect of changes in metal prices  and to the risks inherent in mining and processing operations 
in addition  allied nevada has seven geothermal leases that were entered into during from the blm 
these leases occur in proximity to  or in some cases overlap with  existing allied nevada mineral holdings  and were obtained through competitive bidding 
operating properties hycroft mine logo we currently have one operating property  the hycroft mine  which we also refer to as hycroft in this document 
this mine and related facilities are located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
winnemucca  a city with a population of  is a commercial community on interstate  miles northeast of reno 
the town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a municipal airport 
access to the hycroft mine from winnemucca is by means of state road no 
jungo road  a good quality  unpaved road and a short access road to the main entrance of the mine 
well maintained mine and exploration roads provide access throughout the property 
access is also possible from imlay  gerlach  and lovelock by unpaved roads intersecting interstate and nevada state route the majority of our employees live in the winnemucca area 
the mine is situated east of the black rock desert on the western flank of the kamma mountains between winnemucca and gerlach 
there are no streams  rivers  or major lakes in the general area 
elevations in the mine area range between  and  ft above sea level 
the company holds patented and  unpatented mining claims that constitute our hycroft mine operating property 
the total acreage covered by unpatented claims is approximately  acres with an additional  acres related to the patented claims 
the details of these claims and the holding requirements are discussed in greater detail in the geology and ore reserve section that follows 

table of contents the climate of the region is arid  with precipitation averaging inches per year 
temperatures during the summer range from daily low temperatures lows of f to daily high temperatures highs of greater than f and winter temperatures range from lows of f to highs of greater than f 
there is strong surface heating during the day and rapid nighttime cooling because of the dry air 
this results in wide ranges in daily temperatures 
the hycroft mine consists of multiple open pit mines  associated waste dumps and two heap leach pads 
the hycroft mine was formally known as the crofoot lewis open pit mine 
mining began in the area in with a small heap leaching operation known as the lewis mine 
lewis mine production was followed by production from the crofoot property in the bay  south central  boneyard  gap and cut pits along the central fault  and finally the north end of the brimstone pit and continued until it was placed on a care and maintenance program in december due to low gold prices 
during this first operating period the mine produced over one million ounces of gold and two and one half million ounces of silver 
gold production from the leaching and rinsing of the heap leach pads  continued in and in   and  the amount of gold recovered was not material 
the lewis mine was acquired by vista in early from fw lewis  inc and the crofoot mine was acquired by vista in april the leasehold interest in the lewis property along with gold and silver net smelter returns nsrs was purchased from fw lewis  inc by vista on december  in consideration of the payment of million 
the crofoot property was originally held under two leases and is now owned by allied nevada subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the lease agreements include for the payment of advance royalty payments of  in any year where mining occurs on the crofoot claims and additional payments of  in any year that hycroft mines over five million tons of ore on the crofoot claims 
all advance royalty payments are credited against the future payments under the net profits royalty 
the total lease payments under the crofoot lease claims are subject to a maximum of million in royalty payments of which the company has paid approximately million through december  at december   the book cost of the hycroft property totaled million and its associated plant and equipment totaled million 
the site receives electrical power provided by nv energy from the northwestern nevada power grid 
the hycroft mine currently has water rights  which are adequate to process the planned oxide heap leach ore 
activities key operating statistics for the years ended december  and are as follows years ended december  ore mined tons waste mined tons total material mined tons ore grade gold oz ton ore grade silver oz ton ounces sold gold ounces sold silver average realized price gold average realized price silver average spot price gold average spot price silver in  hycroft successfully completed its third full year of operations 
the mine moved million tons of material  including million tons of ore placed on the leach pad at average grades of opt gold and opt silver 
the company sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in the major accomplishments in were as follows completed more than two full years with no lost time accidents and no significant environmental issues at hycroft 
announced two sec industry guide compliant updated mineralized material estimates for hycroft in march and august  the mineralized material estimate announced in october indicated a significant increase in proven and probable reserves to million ounces of gold and million ounces of silver 
completed the hycroft milling feasibility study that indicated expanded mining and processing facilities could support annual production of  ounces of gold and million ounces of silver from the board of directors approved the capital spending to complete detailed engineering and ordering of long lead time items in connection with this expansion project 

table of contents continued to implement the heap leach expansion with the addition of four ton haul trucks  two hitachi ex shovels and one hitachi ex shovel 
completed a positive study indicating the benefits of accelerating construction of a gyratory crusher for use in the heap leach expansion 
the board of directors approved the capital spending to complete detailed engineering  ordering of long lead time items  and the construction of this project 
it is expected that the crusher will be operational in mid completed construction of a new truck shop capable of servicing the larger mining equipment 
expanded the merrill crowe processing facility  increasing the processing capacity from  gallons per minute gpm to  gpm 
the pumping system was also upgraded to increase the pumping capacity to  gpm to the leach pads 
completed an additional million square foot expansion to the brimstone leach pad as planned 
began preparing the lewis leach pad  located beside the brimstone pad  for a million square foot expansion to be completed in the first quarter of hycroft expansion plan the company is currently expanding hycroft operations to include increasing the mining rate  improving the metal recovery potential with crushing and ultimately milling processes and adding the potential to process sulfide material 
the expansion project is the combination of the following three related projects which have been previously announced the company began implementing an accelerated heap leach mine plan in mid with a goal of increasing the mining rate utilizing a larger capacity mining fleet and upgrading existing oxide processing facilities 
in  the company decided to accelerate construction of the large gyratory crushing unit to be utilized in the heap leach operation 
in  the company completed a positive feasibility study on the hycroft mill expansion option 
under this project  a milling process will supplement the heap leach operations 
the mill will process the higher grade fractions of the oxide mineralization and all of the transitional and sulfide mineralization 
the board has approved the capital expenditures to complete detailed engineering to construct the mill and the ordering of long lead time items critical to the proposed construction timelines 
upon completion of the detailed engineering  the board expects to approve the construction of the mill 
the current expansion project from this point forward is best described in the following four related activities mine expansion 
the current expansion project requires the company to increase its mining rate from the million tons of material mined in to million tons of material by the end of and ultimately to more than million tons of material once the mill is constructed 
this expansion stage involves purchasing larger capacity haul trucks  shovels and production drills along with ancillary mining equipment 
by the end of  a significant portion of the larger mobile mining fleet was in operation including two smaller and two larger capacity hydraulic shovels  seven ton haul trucks and additional support equipment 
leach pad expansion 
while the mill is being built  the increased oxide mineralization mined will be processed on leachpads 
to accommodate the oxide ore being milled  the existing leach pad system needs to be expanded 
the addition of the gyratory crusher is intended to benefit the ultimate recovery of gold from the leach pads 
in  the merrill crowe plant was expanded to increase the solution processing capacity from  gallons per minute to  gallons per minute 
the brimstone leach pad expansion was completed increasing the pad size to million square feet 
in addition  preparation of the lewis leach pad  located directly adjacent to the brimstone pad  began and is expected to add million square feet of leach pad space in early to date  the primary  secondary and tertiary units have been ordered including a gyratory crusher  cone crushers and screens 
it is anticipated that the gyratory crushing plant will become operational mid the effect of this implementation is intended to increase annual gold production to approximately  ounces by the end of mill construction 
based on the completed feasibility study  the economics of the project could be increased by constructing a mill to process the higher grade oxide mineralization along with the transitional and sulfide mineralization 
the company is currently completing the detailed engineering and has begun ordering long lead time items critical to the construction schedule 
to date  the major long lead components of the grinding circuit semi autogenous grinding mills and ball mills have been ordered and are on schedule to arrive as per the construction timeline 
infrastructure 
the future expansion plans require the company to upgrade the infrastructure at the hycroft mine 
major infrastructure items include the upgrade of the power transmission and distribution system to handle the milling demands and the construction of a rail siding 
the initial capital cost estimate for the expansion project is expected to be billion 
as of february   allied nevada had spent or committed million  which is below the feasibility estimate for this equipment and represents approximately of the total capital expenditure estimate 
all equipment pricing is firm and includes freight and taxes 
in the case of the mining equipment  the pricing also includes on site assembly and commissioning 

table of contents geology the hycroft mine is located on the western flank of the kamma mountains 
the deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the tertiary kamma mountain volcanics 
the volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs  flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks 
fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia 
volcanic rocks have been block faulted by dominant north trending structures  which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization 
the central fault and east fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation 
a post mineral range front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent pleistocene lahontan lake sediments in the black rock desert 
the known gold mineralization within the crofoot and lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles in a north south direction by miles in an east west direction 
mineralization extends to a depth of less than feet in the outcropping to near outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over  feet in the vortex deposit in the east 
not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization 
the hycroft mine property consists of patented claims that comprise approximately  acres and  unpatented claims that comprise approximately  acres 
combining the patented and unpatented claims  total claims cover approximately  acres 
this claim package was acquired by the company in a series of transactions the crofoot property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in the crofoot property  originally held under lease  is owned by hycroft resources development  inc subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners  the fw lewis property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in early  in  approximately  acres of additional claims were staked by vista 
these claims were around or contiguous to the original crofoot and fw lewis claims  in  we staked approximately  acres of additional claims contiguous to or around the existing hycroft claims  in  we staked an additional claims consisting of approximately  acres contiguous to or around the existing hycroft land holding  and in  we staked an additional claims and  acres contiguous to or around the existing hycroft land holding 
our hycroft patented claims occupy private lands and our unpatented claims occupy public lands 
the public lands include unpatented mining claims on lands administered by the blm 
these claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the us federal government and the state of nevada 
to maintain the patented claims in good standing  we must pay the annual property tax payments to the county in which the claims are held 
to maintain the unpatented claims in good standing  we must file a notice of intent to maintain the claims within the county and pay the annual mineral claim filing fees to the blm 
mineral proven and probable ore reserves recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december   in accordance with industry guide as required by the exchange act 
proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries 
proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping  drilling  sampling  assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry  as more fully discussed below 
the term reserve  as used in the reserve data presented here  means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the term proven reserves means reserves for which quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and the sites for inspection  sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
the term probable reserves means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies 
we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk 
we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 
our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees  and a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining  geology and reserve determination 
estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december   were determined using long term average prices of per ounce for gold and per ounce for silver 
the london spot metal prices for the past three years averaged approximately  per ounce for gold and per ounce for silver 

table of contents below is a summary of the mineral proven and probable ore reserves as of december  gold silver ore contained contained waste tons ounces ounces tons strip category s oz ton s oz ton s s ratio proven reserves probable reserves proven and probable reserves mine operations the mining in of the brimstone pit and cut pit will be conducted by open pit methods using and ton haul trucks  hydraulic shovels  high capacity pit viper blast hole drills 
mining in the brimstone pit has been designed with five mining phases  and the cut pit will be mined in two single top down mining sequences 
our current mine plans are to increase production to an annual mining rate of million tons of material in and over million tons of material in we are currently in the third phase of five phases of mining in the brimstone pit and the first phase of mining in the cut pit 
this phase of mining involves the mining of more ore and less waste  than experienced in previous phases  and it is expected that the strip ratio will be lower than the expansion program in progress will deliver more ore to the heap leach pads and we have taken delivery of seven ton haul trucks and four hydraulic shovels to accomplish this expansion program 
in  we expect to receive one hydraulic shovel  three pit viper high capacity production drills  and nine ton haul trucks 
for  lower grade ore will be hauled by truck and placed on the brimstone and lewis leach pads as run of mine material 
higher grade material will be crushed and placed on the brimstone and lewis leach pads 
the brimstone pad system is currently comprised of the previously operated brimstone leach pad and has grown through four expansions between the lewis leach pad is a historically operated million square foot leach pad that has been dormant since the mine shut down in the mine began removing old material from the leach pad in and has been preparing the leach pad for use beginning in the first quarter of this leach pad system has sufficient capacity to handle our ore placement requirements for we plan to continually expand this leach pad system to meet production requirements 
all ore grade material placed on the leach pad will be cross ripped to enhance permeability 
a network of solution drip lines will be positioned and the run of mine material will be leached with a cyanide solution for a period of approximately to days before another foot high lift of ore is placed on top of the existing lift 
return solution from the pad containing the precious metals is directed to the pregnant or lean solution pond 
gold will be removed from pregnant solutions using a carbon in column cic process and at the brimstone plant using the merrill crowe zinc precipitation process merrill crowe process 
the product from the cic process will be transported to a third party for processing to recover the precious metals from the carbon and produce a dor containing gold and silver 
dor containing gold and silver will be produced at the hycroft mine from the merrill crowe process 
low grade pregnant solution directed to the lean pond will be used for stacking which encompasses recycling pregnant solution back to the ore pad to increase solution overall metal grades 
based on previous operating experience  of the gold and of the silver placed on the pad as run of mine production is expected to be recovered in the plant 
crushing ore is expected to improve the overall average recovery of gold and silver 
during  we expect to increase the annual gold production from the hycroft mine by increasing mining rates 
an accelerated mine plan  approved by the company in  will increase the tons mined to over million per year by the additional ore mined would result in estimated annual gold production in the range of  to  ounces in and  ounces in the existing mobile mine equipment fleet and process facilities are currently being expanded to accommodate the increased production 
hycroft mine exploration and development drilling since the formation of the company in may  allied nevada  as of year end  has drilled a total of approximately  holes  for a combined total of  feet  at the hycroft mine 
material from all the holes has been assayed using a fire assay procedure for both gold and silver content by one of three independent laboratories 
upon completion of a drill hole  the hole is surveyed and then plugged 
management of the drill program  sample collection and assay program is being carried out by allied nevada 
qualified independent consultants have reviewed all aspects of the exploration program and are expected to conduct regular reviews of the ongoing exploration program 
the following currently identified zones are albert  bay  camel  central  boneyard  brimstone  foothills  and vortex 
in  allied nevada drilled holes  representing approximately  feet  with focus on metallurgical drilling at central  brimstone  and vortex  geotechnical drilling at central and vortex  and step out drilling at central and brimstone 
the drilling results have been utilized to update the corresponding engineering models 
of the total program  holes were directed at infill  step out  and metallurgy at central  holes were directed at step out and metallurgy at brimstone  holes at vortex step out and metallurgy  holes at dump condemnation  holes at hydrology monitoring  holes at geotechnical design  holes at operational issues  and holes at property wide exploration 

table of contents a  foot development program has been designed for with a focus on facility condemnation  and core drilling in support of metallurgical and geotechnical studies and the mill expansion 
a  foot exploration program at oscar is intended to test this area for potential outside the current mine footprint 
the analysis of the current drill results and historical geological information suggests that gold and silver mineralization is hosted along north south trending zones of approximately  feet in length 
these zones are partially defined laterally by post mineral faults 
the first quarter drill program will be focused on defining metallurgy and geotechnical at the main zones of central  brimstone  and vortex 
any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan will require us to obtain all necessary permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
advanced exploration properties advanced exploration properties are both those properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material

an additional nsr on certain hasbrouck claims is held by other parties 
geology the property is located on hasbrouck mountain  which is thought to lie along the western edge of a caldera 
the mountain is underlain by gently dipping ash flow  air fall and waterlain tuffs and volcaniclastic sediments of the miocene siebert formation 
several occurrences of chalcedonic sinter deposits occur near the summit of the mountain 
gold and silver mineralization in the hasbrouck deposit appears to have formed relatively close to the paleo surface in an epithermal  hot spring environment 
the mineralization is concentrated in the siebert formation  in units stratigraphically below the chalcedonic sinter deposits that are exposed near the top of hasbrouck 
multiple zones of higher grade mineralization are presently defined 
the saddle zone consists of a structurally and stratigraphically controlled higher grade mineral body  with the highest grade mineralization hosted in hydrothermal breccia bodies 
the crossroads zone is east of and adjacent to the saddle zone  consisting of higher than average grade disseminated mineralization interspersed with higher grade veins 
the franco zone is adjacent to the east with the crossroads zone  and hosts mineralization similar to crossroads  with higher grade mineralization in veins 
mineralization is continuous between the three zones 
these zones are surrounded by lower grade mineralized material

access to the site is via county maintained gravel roads from the northwest end of town 
three hills consists of unpatented lode claims totaling approximately acres 
on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which included both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property 
the terms of this agreement are detailed under the hasbrouck description above 
newmont capital did not exercise their right to acquire of the properties in august of geology three hills is located in the walker lane structural domain of the basin and range physiographic province 
it is in an area of structural disruption resulting from a series of orogenic events occurring in paleozoic  mesozoic and cenozoic times 
basin and range high angle normal faults control the mineralization at three hills  where they cut the siebert formation 
gold mineralization occurs in a zone of pervasive silicification and in the siebert formation and the upper to feet of the fraction tuff 
the contact between these two units contains consistently higher grades of gold and is more commonly argillized than silicified 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the three hills study included data from  feet of drilling  comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet  air track and rotary holes totaling  feet and diamond drill holes totaling  feet

future costs will be shared by silver standard and allied nevada on the same ratio as established for operation of the management committee allied nevada silver standard  subject to standard dilution provisions 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the maverick springs project 
in november  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling  feet on the maverick springs project 
the program consisted of seven vertical reverse circulation holes  stepped out feet to  feet from previously identified mineralization 
all seven holes encountered flat lying mineralization  predominantly oxidized to depths of up to feet 
the program outlined continuous mineralization in a  foot by  foot area  immediately adjacent to known gold silver mineralization 
with additional in fill drilling  this newly outlined mineralization has the potential to significantly increase the mineralized material 
in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet  in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet and in august  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling approximately  feet 
in the th quarter of  silver standard completed a hole program totaling  feet 
these results indicate the potential for bulk mineable gold silver mineralization 
geology maverick springs can be classified as a carlin type or sediment carbonate hosted disseminated silver gold deposit 
sediment hosted deposits are common within northern nevada  although the systems are usually gold dominated with relatively minor amounts of silver 
silver and gold mineralization at maverick springs has been interpreted as a roughly antiformal or arch shaped zone with an axis that plunges shallowly to the south and seems to flatten to horizontal over the northern half of the deposit 
the limbs of the arch dip shallowly to moderately at to the east and west 
overall  the mineralized zone is elongated in the north south direction with a length of over  feet  a width of up to  feet  and a thickness of commonly feet 
alteration consists of pervasive decalcification  weak to intense silicification and weak alunitic argillization 
massive jasperoid is common in surface exposures and in drill core 
oxidation has affected all sulfides on surface and is pervasive to a depth of at least feet  intermittent to feet  and generally absent below  feet

geology wildcat lies in the seven troughs range  which is underlain by triassic and jurassic sedimentary rocks and has been intruded by cretaceous granodiorite 
volcanic domes and plugs of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite have been emplaced by tertiary volcanism 
post mineral tertiary flows of pyroclastic debris  and vitrophyres of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite composition blanket much of the area 
the property contains at least two aerially extensive breccia bodies located at the intersection of through going fault zones 
four areas  hero tag  main  northeast  and knob are located within the southern breccia body and contain the majority of drilling and all of the known mineralized material 
these four areas are geologically similar with mineralization straddling the contact between granodiorite and overlying tuff within the breccia body 
mineralization hosted in the tuff generally tends to be lower grade disseminated style of mineralization represented by pervasive and intense silicification 
the underlying granodiorite also contains low grade disseminated style of mineralization with areas of higher grade associated with quartz vein stockwork 
peripheral to the breccia bodies  discrete mineralized banded veins in the granodiorite were exploited by historical mining and were generally not targeted by drilling 
deeper roots to the mineralized breccia bodies have not been explored 
a second aerially extensive mineralized breccia body is located miles to the northwest in the cross roads area and is predominantly defined by surface samples only 
permits have been received from the bureau of land management and state of nevada to conduct an initial drill program in the company anticipates submitting for additional permits for drill activities in drilling will focus on initial testing of the cross roads breccia body  banded veins proximal to the southern breccia body  and potential roots to the southern breccia body

a year later  after drilling reverse circulation drill holes  homestake terminated their agreement with mr 
pescio 
nevada contact inc optioned the property from the pescios in and drilled holes before terminating the agreement in early in july  mill city optioned the property from the pescios 
the mill city agreement was terminated in geology most of the property is comprised of dry  sagebrush covered and grass covered hills with a few juniper and pinyon pines 
the climate is favorable for year round mining and exploration may be done from may through november 
the pony creek property lies along the axis of a regional mesozoic anticline that parallels the crest of the pinyon range 
the lithologies of the region include the eastern carbonate assemblage and the mixed overlap assemblage 
the late devonian early mississippian roberts mountain thrust and the post pinyon anticline  mesozoic thrust faults have moved the western assemblage and a significant portion of the overlap series over the eastern facies 
high angle northeast and northwest trending faults and north trending faults  all with oblique displacement  and a younger set of east trending normal faults  are important elements in the structural framework of the region 
gold mineralization in the bowl area is related to felsite breccias 
in the pot holes area  a lens of fragmental felsite approximately feet thick intersects the low angle fault that is at the base of the robinson thrust plate 
the felsite breccias of the bowl area may be fault breccia to explosion breccias 
alteration within the intrusive includes quartz sericite pyrite qsp associated with north and northeast trending shears 
other exploration properties in general  other exploration properties consist of those properties for which insufficient drilling and geologic investigations have been completed to define mineralized materials 
other exploration properties may include properties that the company does not have a significant controlling interest or joint venture on 
allied nevada has approximately other exploration properties 
certain of these exploration properties have been optioned and leased to other exploration companies in return for production royalties averaging approximately advance minimum royalties and  on some of the properties  work commitments 
for the properties under lease  the lessee is typically responsible for making the land payments including the blm fees and county property tax payments 
blm filing fees and county property tax payments were paid for approximately  unpatented mining claims held by allied nevada 
during  the company completed drill holes  totaling approximately  feet  at the illipah project 
we will pursue strategic options for the exploration properties that could include development through exploration programs  joint ventures  royalty agreements  or the sale or release of the mineral property

glossary amr means advance minimum royalty 
assay means to test minerals by chemical or other methods for the purpose of determining the amount of valuable metals contained 
breccia means rock consisting of fragments  more or less angular  in a matrix of finer grained material or of cementing material 
claim means a mining interest giving its holder the right to prospect  explore for and exploit minerals within a defined area 
cut off grade means the grade below which mineralized material will be considered waste 
deposit is an informal term for an accumulation of mineral ores 
development stage is one engaged in the preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit reserves for its extraction which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
diamond drill means a rotary type of rock drill that cuts a core of rock and is recovered in long cylindrical sections  two centimeters or more in diameter 
exploration stage is one engaged in the search for mineral deposits reserves which is not in either the development or production stage 
fault means a fracture in rock along which there has been displacement of the two sides parallel to the fracture 
heap leach is a gold extraction method that percolates a cyanide solution through ore heaped on an impervious pad or base 
mineralization means the concentration of metals within a body of rock 
mineralized material is a body that contains mineralization which has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and or underground sampling to estimate a sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal s 
such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve until a comprehensive evaluation based upon unit cost  grade  recoveries  and other material factors conclude legal and economic feasibility

the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
production stage is one engaged in the exploitation of a mineral deposit reserve 
proven reserves means reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth  and mineral content of reserves are well established 
recovery means that portion of the metal contained in the ore that is successfully extracted by processing  expressed as a percentage 
reserves or ore reserves mean that part of a mineral deposit  which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination

sulfide means a compound of sulfur and some other element 
tailings means material rejected from a mill after most of the valuable minerals have been extracted 
ton means a short ton  pounds 
vein means a fissure  fault or crack in a rock filled by minerals that have traveled upwards from some deep source 
volcaniclastic means clastic made up of fragments of preexisting rocks rock chiefly composed of volcanic material derived by ejection of volcanic material from a volcanic vent
