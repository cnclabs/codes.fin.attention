item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is committed to leveraging our innovative signaling pathway drug technologies in seeking to develop next generation network targeted cancer therapies 
we are building upon our experience in modulating signaling pathways  including the hedgehog signaling pathway  in our effort to develop network targeted cancer therapies 
we conduct our research and development programs both internally and through strategic collaborations 
hedgehog pathway inhibitor program erivedge erivedge vismodegib capsule 
our most advanced program is our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program under collaboration with genentech  inc  a member of the roche group 
the lead drug candidate being developed under this program is erivedge  a first in class orally administered small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor  which is also referred to as vismodegib  gdc and rg erivedge is designed to selectively inhibit signaling in the hedgehog pathway by targeting a protein called smoothened 
the hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating proper growth and development in the early stages of life and becomes less active in adults 
however  mutations in the pathway that reactivate hedgehog signaling are seen in certain cancers  including basal cell carcinoma  or bcc 
abnormal signaling in the hedgehog pathway is implicated in over of bcc cases 
in january  erivedge was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  as the first and only fda approved medicine for adults with advanced forms of basal cell carcinoma that has spread to other parts of the body or that has come back after surgery or that their healthcare provider decides cannot be treated with surgery or radiation 
it is not known if erivedge is safe and effective in children 
we earned a  milestone payment from genentech as a result of the fda s approval of erivedge in this indication and we are also entitled to receive royalties on future sales of the product 
during the fourth quarter of  we received a total of  in milestone payments from genentech relating to the fda s acceptance of genentech s new drug application  or nda  for erivedge and the european medicines agency s  or ema s  acceptance for review of a marketing authorization application  or maa for erivedge  that was submitted by roche in december the genentech nda and roche maa applications were based on positive clinical data from erivance bcc shhg  a pivotal phase ii study of erivedge in patients with advanced bcc 
we will receive an additional milestone payment if erivedge also receives ema marketing authorization  as well as royalties on any future sales in this territory 
genentech is also conducting a separate phase ii clinical trial of erivedge in patients with operable nodular basal cell carcinoma  which is a less severe form of the disease and accounts for a significant percentage of the approximately two million bccs diagnosed annually in the united states 
we anticipate that the study will be completed during early in addition to the bcc clinical trials being conducted directly by genentech and roche  erivedge is also currently being tested in other cancers in trials under collaborative agreements between genentech and either third party investigators or the us national cancer institute  or nci 

table of contents network targeted cancer programs our internal drug development efforts are focused on our network targeted cancer programs  in which we are seeking to design single novel small molecule drug candidates that inhibit multiple signaling pathways that are believed to play roles in cancer cell proliferation 
we refer to this approach as cancer network disruption 
we believe that our approach of targeting multiple nodes in cancer signaling pathway networks may provide a better therapeutic effect than many of the cancer drugs currently marketed or in development since our drug candidates are being designed to disrupt multiple targets in the cancer network environment as compared to most other cancer drugs which are designed to disrupt only one target 
cudc our lead candidate from these programs is cudc  a first in class small molecule compound designed to simultaneously target histone deacetylase  or hdac  epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  and human epidermal growth factor receptor  or her  all of which are validated cancer targets 
a significant amount of our capital resources are focused on the ongoing clinical development of this molecule 
to date  we have completed a phase i dose escalation clinical trial of cudc in patients with advanced  refractory solid tumors and we have completed enrollment in a phase i expansion trial to test cudc in patients with specific tumor types  including breast  gastric  head and neck  liver and non small cell lung cancers 
the phase i expansion trial is designed as an open label study in which patients are treated with cudc at the maximum tolerated dose  which was determined in the phase i dose escalation study to be milligrams per meter the primary objectives of this study are to compare the safety and tolerability of cudc in subjects with these specific advanced solid tumors when the drug is administered via one hour intravenous infusion either on a five days per week schedule one week on one week off or on a three days per week schedule three weeks on one week off 
during the second quarter of  we initiated a phase i clinical trial of cudc in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients whose cancer is human papilloma virus  or hpv  negative 
we have treated four patients in this trial as of february  the primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of cudc when administered in combination with the current standard of care of cisplatin  a chemotherapeutic drug  and radiation 
upon determination of the maximum tolerated dose and assuming the otherwise successful completion of the phase i trial  we intend to conduct a randomized phase ii two arm clinical trial in which head and neck cancer patients will receive cisplatin and radiation plus or minus cudc the phase ii study would seek to evaluate whether the addition of cudc can improve the efficacy of cisplatin and radiation therapy in this patient population 
we currently estimate initiating this phase ii study in the first half of we are also working on an oral formulation of cudc  which we believe has the potential to make cudc more competitive in certain cancers such as non small cell lung cancer or in other cancers where there are investigational or competing commercially available molecules that are orally administered 
pending the successful completion of ongoing formulation and preclinical development work  we intend to begin a phase i study of an oral formulation of cudc in the second half of cudc in january  we selected development candidate cudc  an orally bioavailable  network targeted small molecule that is designed to inhibit hdac and phosphatidylinositol kinase  or pik 
our scientists are developing cudc based on published and internally generated data demonstrating that hdac and pik inhibitors have synergistic interaction in certain preclinical cancer models 
we believe that this synergistic mechanism of cancer signaling network disruption  which demonstrated efficacy and a favorable safety profile in a number of preclinical xenograft models  could translate into clinical advantages over single agents 
in november  we entered into an agreement under which the leukemia lymphoma society  or lls  will provide a portion of the funding of the development of cudc if we succeed in advancing this development candidate into a clinical trial for patients with b cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma 
pending the successful completion of ongoing formulation and preclinical development work  we expect to file an ind with the fda to test an oral formulation of cudc during the second half of 
table of contents in addition to our development stage programs  we continue to progress additional proprietary preclinical research programs and expect that we will select additional small molecule inhibitors from our preclinical portfolio in the future 
hsp program debio our heat shock protein  or hsp  program is being developed by debiopharm  a swiss pharmaceutical development company  under an august license agreement between curis and debiopharm 
the lead molecule under this license collaboration was designated debio by debiopharm 
in april  debiopharm treated the first patient in a phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety of debio in patients suffering from advanced solid tumors 
in  debiopharm successfully advanced debio through the dose escalation portion of the phase i study 
debio was generally well tolerated  with no evidence of ocular or liver toxicity  and showed promising signs of efficacy in patients with advanced solid tumors in this study 
debiopharm has indicated that it expects to present phase i data from this phase i study at a medical conference during the first half of debiopharm advanced debio into the phase ib expansion portion of the study in the beginning of debiopharm expects to treat approximately patients in this study  with the primary objectives of the phase ib study  an expansion cohort of solid tumor patients  will be to further assess the safety profile  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of debio at the recommended dose level of mg daily that was established in the dose escalation portion of the phase i clinical trial  and to make a preliminary assessment of anti tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors  including patients with non small cell lung cancer 
debiopharm has also indicated that it expects to initiate a combination phase i ii study in non small cell lung cancer patients in the second quarter of we are eligible for our next milestone payment under our license agreement if and when debiopharm treats its fifth patient in a phase ii clinical trial  assuming that debiopharm advances debio into phase ii clinical testing 
we currently anticipate that phase ii testing could commence in the first half of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through license fees  contingent cash payments  research and development funding from our corporate collaborators  the private and public placement of our equity securities  debt financings and the monetization of certain royalty rights 
we have never been profitable and have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating losses for the next several years as we devote substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and do not expect to achieve profitability in the foreseeable future  if at all 
we anticipate that existing capital resources as of december  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the second half of we believe that near term key drivers to our success will include genentech s ability to successfully launch and commercialize erivedge in the us  genentech s receipt of ema approval to commercialize erivedge in advanced bcc as well as its ability to successfully launch and commercialize erivedge in the european market  debiopharm s ability to advance debio into later stages of clinical development  our ability to successfully plan  finance and complete clinical trials for cudc and advance cudc into later stages of clinical development in indications other than head and neck cancers  our ability to successfully advance early stage development candidates  such as cudc into clinical testing  our ability to successfully enter into one or more material licenses or collaboration agreements for our proprietary drug candidates  and our ability to advance the research of other small molecule cancer drug candidates that we are developing under our proprietary pipeline of network targeted cancer programs 

table of contents in the longer term  a key driver to our success will be our ability  and the ability of any current or future collaborator or licensee  to successfully commercialize drugs based upon our proprietary technologies 
collaboration agreements we are currently a party to a june collaboration with genentech relating to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor technologies  and an august license agreement with debiopharm relating to our hsp inhibitor technology 
our past and current collaborations have generally provided for research  development and commercialization programs to be wholly or majority funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional contingent cash payments if specified development and regulatory approval objectives are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon the collaborations 
we are currently not receiving any research funding and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future from genentech or debiopharm under our current agreements with these parties 
under our collaborations with genentech  we currently expect to incur only costs related to the maintenance of licenses  including sublicense payments due upon milestone payments and any royalties we receive  as well as patent related expenses 
as a result of our licensing agreements with various universities  we are also obligated to make payments to these university licensors when we receive certain payments from genentech 
as of december   we have incurred an aggregate of approximately  related to ongoing agreements  of which  relates to payments that we received from genentech 
as we receive additional milestone payments from genentech upon fda approval of erivedge obtained in january  and ema approval  if achieved  we will be obligated to pay in additional sublicense fees to these licensors  as well as a total of of any royalties received from the sale of erivedge 
we do not expect to incur any material costs related to our hsp technologies under development by debiopharm under our august license agreement with debiopharm 
our current collaboration agreements are summarized as follows genentech hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration 
under the terms of the june agreement with genentech  we granted genentech an exclusive  global  royalty bearing license  with the right to sublicense  to make  use  sell and import small molecule and antibody hedgehog pathway inhibitors 
in november  genentech granted a sublicense to f 
hoffmann laroche  ltd roche for non us rights to gdc roche received this sublicense pursuant to an agreement between genentech and roche under which genentech granted roche an option to obtain a license to commercialize certain genentech products in non us markets 
in february  we announced that chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd 
had exercised its right of first refusal for the development and commercialization in japan of gdc under an existing agreement with roche 
genentech and roche have primary responsibility for worldwide clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing 
we are not a party to this agreement between genentech and roche but we are eligible to receive cash payments for regulatory filing and approval objectives achieved and future royalties on products developed outside of the us  if any  under our june collaboration agreement with genentech 
the lead drug candidate being developed under this program is erivedge  a first in class orally administered small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor that is the first and only fda approved medicine for adults with advanced forms of basal cell carcinoma 
genentech and roche are responsible for worldwide clinical development  regulatory affairs  manufacturing and supply  formulation and sales and marketing of erivedge 
we are eligible to receive cash payments for regulatory filing and approval objectives achieved and future royalties on products developed outside of the us  if any  under our june collaboration agreement with genentech 
we are eligible to receive up to  in contingent cash payments under the terms of our june collaboration for the development of erivedge or another small molecule  assuming the successful achievement by genentech and roche of specified clinical development and regulatory objectives 
we have received  of this amount including the  payment that we earned in january we are also eligible to receive royalties on sales of any hedgehog pathway inhibitor products that are successfully commercialized by genentech and roche 
for erivedge  we are entitled to a mid to high single digit royalty  which escalates within this range with increasing product sales 
in certain specified circumstances  the royalty rate applicable to erivedge may be decreased to a low to mid single digit royalty 

table of contents debiopharm hsp collaboration 
in august  we granted a worldwide  exclusive royalty bearing license to our hsp inhibitor technology to debiopharm  a swiss pharmaceutical development company 
the lead molecule under this license collaboration was designated debio by debiopharm 
debiopharm has assumed all future development responsibility and costs related to the development  registration and commercialization of products under the agreement 
as part of the consideration under the agreement  debiopharm paid us an up front license fee of  and we received  during in contingent payments upon debiopharm s successful achievement of clinical objectives  including the approval from french regulatory authorities of debiopharm s clinical trial application  or cta  to begin phase i clinical trials and the treatment of the fifth patient in this trial 
we are also eligible to receive royalties if any products under the license agreement are successfully developed and commercialized 
for net sales of debio that are made directly by debiopharm  we are entitled to a high single digit to low double digit royalty  which escalates within this range with increasing product sales 
in certain specified circumstances  the royalty rate applicable to debio may be reduced 
we believe that it is more likely that debiopharm will sublicense debio following its further development  and in this case we are entitled to a share of royalties that debiopharm receives from such sublicensee 
financial operations overview general 
our future operating results will largely depend on the magnitude of payments from our current and potential future corporate collaborators and the progress of drug candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on  among other factors  the timing of our entry into new collaborations  if any  the timing of the receipt of payments  if any  from new or existing collaborators and the cost and outcome of any preclinical development or clinical trials then being conducted 
we anticipate that existing capital resources as of december  should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the second half of our ability to continue funding our planned operations into and beyond the second half of is dependent on future contingent payments that we may receive from debiopharm  genentech  or the lls upon the achievement of development and regulatory approval objectives  our ability to manage our expenses and our ability to raise additional funds through additional corporate collaborations  equity or debt financings  or from other sources of financing 
we expect to end with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million to million  excluding any potential payments from existing or new collaborators 
we expect that our expenses associated with the clinical development of cudc will increase as we continue to treat patients in our phase i trial in head and neck cancers and initiation of additional trials for cudc and cudc  resulting in an increase in our research and development expenses for future periods as compared to prior years 
we expect that research and development expenses for the year ended december  will be million to million and that general and administrative expenses will be million to million 
these expense estimates include  and million of stock based compensation expense for research and development and general and administrative expense  respectively  which includes employee and director equity grants issued in january actual stock based compensation expense for fiscal may be higher as the result of our issuance of additional awards as part of our planned compensation programs  consistent with past practices 
revenue 
we do not expect to generate any revenue from our direct sale of products for several years  if ever 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been derived from license fees  research and development payments  and other amounts that we have received from our strategic collaborators and licensees 
for the year ended december   genentech accounted for  or  of our total revenue 
we have not recognized any royalty revenue to date but we expect that we will recognize royalties attributed to the sale of erivedge in we could receive additional milestone payments from our collaborators genentech and debiopharm  provided the respective programs meet contractually specified development and regulatory objectives 
for example  we earned a  milestone payment from genentech in january upon fda approval of erivedge 
in addition  erivedge is currently being reviewed for potential marketing approval by the ema in european territories 
we are eligible to receive additional milestone revenue should erivedge receive approval by the ema  and we are also eligible to receive royalties on net sales of erivedge 

table of contents we currently receive no research funding for our programs under our collaborations with genentech and debiopharm and we do not expect to receive such funding in the future under these collaborations 
accordingly  our only source of revenues and or cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and funded research and development that we may receive under new collaboration agreements  if any  contingent cash payments for the achievement of clinical development and regulatory objectives  if any are met  under new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech and debiopharm and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon these collaborations 
our ability to enter into new collaborations and our receipt of additional payments under our existing collaborations with genentech and debiopharm cannot be assured  nor can we predict the timing of any such arrangements or payments  as the case may be 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop our drug candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel including stock based compensation expense  outside service costs including clinical research organizations  medicinal chemistry and sublicense payments  and the costs of supplies and reagents  consulting  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we are currently incurring only nominal research and development expenses under our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech related to the maintenance of third party licenses to certain background technologies 
for each contingent payment  if any  received under the hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration  we would be obligated to make payments to certain third party licensors and recognize the related expense 
our research and development programs  both internal and under collaboration  are summarized in the following table product candidate primary disease collaborator licensee status hedgehog pathway inhibitor erivedge vismodegib advanced bcc advanced bcc genentech genentech fda approval maa review erivedge vismodegib operable nodular bcc genentech phase ii network targeted cancer programs cudc intravenous formulation hdac  egfr  her inhibitor cancer internal development phase i expansion cudc intravenous formulation hdac  egfr  her inhibitor locally advanced hpv head and neck cancer internal development phase i cudc oral formulation hdac  egfr  her inhibitor cancer internal development development candidate cudc hdac  pik inhibitor cancer internal development development candidate other network targeted cancer programs cancer internal development preclinical debio formerly cudc hsp inhibitor cancer debiopharm phase ib in the chart above  fda approval means that genentech s nda was approved by the fda for commercialization of erivedge in the united states 
maa review means that roche has filed an maa with the ema  and the ema has accepted and is currently reviewing the application for potential approval to commercialize erivedge in europe 
phase ii means that genentech is currently treating human patients in a phase ii clinical trial  the primary objective of which is a therapeutic response in the patient population 
phase i expansion means that we are currently treating human patients with specific tumor types in an extension of our phase i dose escalation trial  at the maximum tolerated dose from such trial  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the compound being tested 
phase ib means that debiopharm is further assessing the safety profile  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of debio at the recommended phase ii dose level  and seeking to make a preliminary assessment of anti tumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors 
phase i means that we are currently treating human patients in separate phase i clinical trials with cudc  the principal purpose of which is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the compound being tested 
development candidate means that we have selected a single lead candidate for potential future clinical 
table of contents development and are seeking to complete the relevant safety  toxicology  and other studies required to submit an ind application with the fda seeking to commence a phase i clinical trial based on our testing in several preclinical models of human disease of various compounds from a particular compound class 
preclinical means that we are seeking to obtain evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety in preclinical models of human disease of one or more compounds within a particular class of drug candidates 
because of the early stages of development of these programs  our ability and that of our collaborators and licensees to successfully complete preclinical studies and clinical trials of these drug candidates  and the timing of completion of such programs  is highly uncertain 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs which may affect our and our collaborators future results  including the scope  quality of data  rate of progress and cost of clinical trials and other research and development activities undertaken by us or our collaborators  the results of future preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our drug candidates and any products that we may develop  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost and effectiveness of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any of our drug candidates 
any failure to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a further discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our research and development programs on schedule  or at all  and some consequences of failing to do so  are set forth above in part i  item a risk factors 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  stock based compensation expense and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal  patent and accounting services 
patent costs include certain patents covered under collaborations  a portion of which is reimbursed by collaborators and a portion of which is borne by us 
we expect that our general and administration expenses will increase in future periods as patent costs related to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor collaboration with genentech increase as well as an increase in our non cash stock based compensation expense in as compared to prior periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of certain assets and liabilities at our balance sheet date 
such estimates and judgments include the carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets  revenue recognition  the value of certain liabilities  including our warrant liability  and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of clinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  codification topic  revenue recognition 
license fees and multiple element arrangements 
in january  we adopted a new us gaap accounting standard which amends existing revenue recognition accounting guidance to provide accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this new guidance eliminates the requirement to establish objective evidence of fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
because we did not enter into any new multiple element arrangements or modify our existing collaborations during the year ended december   recognition models used to derive our revenues for the year ended december  reflect the superseded guidance and the adoption of the new standard will be implemented on a prospective basis for new or materially modified arrangements 
for multiple element arrangements  including license agreements  entered into prior to january   guidance required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under this guidance  if the fair value of all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations such as research and steering committee services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has stand alone value and the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations  typically including research and or steering committee services  can be determined 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
revenue will be recognized using either a relative performance or straight line method 
we recognize revenue using the relative performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of 
table of contents effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis 
direct labor hours or full time equivalents are typically used as the measure of performance 
revenue recognized under the relative performance method would be determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  by the ratio of level of effort incurred to date to estimated total level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the relative performance method  as of each reporting period 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement  the performance obligations are provided on a best efforts basis and we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential  then the total payments under the arrangement  excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of substantive milestones  would be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the period we expect to complete our performance obligations 
revenue is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative amount of revenue earned  as determined using the straight line basis  as of the period ending date 
if we cannot reasonably estimate when our performance obligation either ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory  then revenue is deferred until we can reasonably estimate when the performance obligation ceases or becomes inconsequential and perfunctory 
revenue is then recognized over the remaining estimated period of performance 
in addition  if we are involved in a steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we assess whether our involvement constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
steering committee services that are not inconsequential or perfunctory and that are determined to be performance obligations are combined with other research services or performance obligations required under an arrangement  if any  in determining the level of effort required in an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete our aggregate performance obligations 
substantive milestone payments 
our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
collaboration agreements that contain substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone meets all of the following criteria be commensurate with either of the following a the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone for example  the achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  or b the enhancement of the value of the deliverable as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone or substantive effort on our part is involved in achieving the milestone  relates solely to past performance  and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
in addition  the determination that one such payment was not a substantive milestone could prevent us from concluding that subsequent milestone payments were substantive milestones and  as a result  any additional milestone payments could also be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and 
table of contents would be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable 
milestones that are tied to regulatory approval are not considered probable of being achieved until such approval is received 
milestones tied to counter party performance are not included in our revenue model until the performance conditions are met 
reimbursement of costs 
reimbursement of research and development costs by third party collaborators has been historically recognized as revenue provided the provisions of fasb codification topic  revenue recognition  principal agent consideration  are met  the amounts are determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenue 
we expect to recognize royalty revenue upon the sale of the related products  provided that the royalty amounts are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have no remaining performance obligations under the arrangement 
if royalties are received when we have remaining performance obligations  we expect to attribute the royalty payments to the services being provided under the arrangement and therefore recognize such royalty payments as such performance obligations are performed under either the relative performance or straight line methods  as applicable  and in accordance with these policies as described above 
we have not recognized any royalty revenue to date but we expect that we will recognize royalties attributed to the sale of erivedge in deferred revenue 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
significant judgments are required in the application of revenue recognition guidance 
for example  in connection with our existing and former collaboration agreements  we have historically recorded on our balance sheet short and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue would be recognized 
short term deferred revenue would consist of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue  or applied against future co development costs  within the next fiscal year 
amounts that we expect will not be recognized in the next fiscal year would be classified as long term deferred revenue 
however  this estimate would be based on our operating plan as of the balance sheet date and on our estimated performance periods under the collaboration in which we have recorded deferred revenues 
if our operating plan or our estimated performance period would change  we could recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the reporting period 
with respect to each of the foregoing areas of revenue recognition  we exercise significant judgment in determining whether an arrangement contains multiple elements  and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognized revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such arrangement would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported financial results 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  which generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and is now referred to as fasb codification topic  compensation stock compensation 
we have recorded employee and director stock based compensation expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we estimate that we will record approximately  in stock based compensation expense in we have granted and expect that we may grant additional options in that could increase the amount of stock based compensation ultimately 
table of contents recognized 
the amount of the incremental employee stock based compensation expense attributable to employee stock options to be granted will depend primarily on the number of stock options granted  the fair market value of our common stock at the respective grant dates  and the specific terms of the stock options 
we measure compensation cost for share based compensation at fair value  including estimated forfeitures  and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the period that the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which generally is the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options 
this model requires significant estimates related to the award s expected life and future stock price volatility of the underlying equity security 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements for our financial assets and financial liabilities  which is now referred to as fasb codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
topic provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
gaap defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are i independent  ii knowledgeable  iii able to transact  and iv willing to transact 
gaap requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach  the income approach and or the cost approach 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount on a discounted basis 
the cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset replacement cost 
valuation techniques should be consistently applied 
gaap also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs  where available  and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities have been classified as either level or level assets 
we do not hold any asset backed or auction rate securities 
short term accounts receivable and accounts payable are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at net realizable value  which approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
in  we completed a registered direct offering in which we issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the warrants include certain protective features for the benefit of the warrantholder  including an exercise price adjustment clause and a possible cash settlement option in the event of a change of control until the later to occur of i two years from the date of original issuance of the warrant  or january  and 
table of contents ii the date upon which genentech or roche submits a new drug application nda for gdc erivedge which occurred in september due to these terms  the warrants were deemed to be a liability 
we estimate the fair value of the warrants using a black scholes option pricing model under various probability weighted outcomes which take into consideration the protective  but limited  cash settlement feature of the warrants 
in using this model  the fair value is determined by applying level inputs  which have included assumptions around the estimated future stock price of our common stock and varying probabilities that certain events will occur 
significant increases or decreases in any of these assumptions would materially impact the fair value of the warrants and our financial statements 
the warrants will be revalued each reporting period with updated assumptions  and the resulting change in fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized in our financial statements 
while we believe our valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and goodwill 
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight line method 
determining the economic lives of property and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
if it were determined that the carrying value of our other long lived assets might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on application of fasb codification topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if an indicator of potential impairment exists 
in performing our evaluations of impairment  we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
these calculations contain uncertainties as they require us to make assumptions related to future cash flows  projected useful lives of assets and the appropriate discount rate to reflect the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we must also make assumptions regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to a material impairment charge 
as a single reporting unit  we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests in december  and  and determined that as of those dates our fair value exceeded the carrying value of our net assets 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was recognized in  and our discussion of our critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

the warrants have an initial exercise price of per share and have a five year term  and the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a long term liability 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated at  on the january issuance date  and  as of december   using a black scholes option pricing model under various probability weighted outcomes which take into consideration the protective  but limited  cash settlement feature for the benefit of the warrantholder that includes a possible cash settlement option in the event of a change of control until the later to occur of i two years from the date of original issuance of the warrant  or january   and ii the date upon which genentech or roche submits an nda for erivedge vismodegib which occurred in september the warrants will be revalued each reporting period  with the resulting gains and losses recorded as the change in fair value of warrant liability in the income statement

we will pay mlv a commission equal to of the gross sales price per share sold  and we have agreed to provide indemnification and contribution to mlv against certain civil liabilities  including liabilities under the securities act 
since the inception of the atm agreement  we have sold  shares of common stock under the atm agreement raising approximately  in gross proceeds  which was offset by offering expenses of approximately  at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of  excluding our restricted investment of  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations 
we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
cash flows the use of our cash flows for operations has primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our office and laboratory  fees paid in connection with preclinical studies  laboratory supplies  consulting fees and legal fees 
during  we began incurring clinical costs associated with our phase i clinical trial of cudc we expect that costs associated with clinical studies will increase in future periods assuming that cudc advances into further stages of clinical testing and other of our network targeted cancer drug candidates such as cudc  reach clinical trials 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was primarily the result of our net loss for the period of  offset by non cash charges totaling  consisting of stock based compensation  changes in the fair value of our warrant liability  non cash interest expense  depreciation and a gain on the sale of assets

the decrease of  in deferred revenue primarily related to our august license agreement with debiopharm and was offset by a decrease of  in our accounts receivable 
we expect to continue to use cash in operations as we continue to seek to advance our targeted cancer drug programs through preclinical testing and into clinical development 
in addition  in the future we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensors based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and other specified objectives 
investing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december  and used cash of  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from net investment activity for the respective periods 
during the year ended december   the restriction on our short term investment ended 
table of contents and we reduced our long term restricted investment resulting in an increase in our available cash for the period of  this increase in cash was offset by purchases of research equipment totaling  during the year ended december  our restricted investments increased by  primarily related to a security deposit for a new facility lease entered into in september and we purchased  in fixed assets during the year ended december  financing activities provided cash of  for the year ended december   principally from the exercise of stock options and warrants and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we also received  in net proceeds from sales of common stock under our atm agreement with mlv 
financing activities provided cash of approximately  for the year ended december   resulting principally from the issuance of  shares of common stock and warrants under our january registered direct offering  which provided  in net proceeds 
in addition  warrants for an aggregate of  shares of common stock were exercised under our august private placement providing approximately  in proceeds 
the remaining cash of  was provided by the exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december  funding requirements we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we will require substantial funds to continue our research and development programs and to fulfill our planned operating goals 
in particular  our currently planned operating and capital requirements include the need for working capital to support our research and development activities for cudc  cudc and other small molecules that we are seeking to develop from our pipeline of network targeted cancer programs  and to fund our general and administrative costs and expenses 
our ability to finance our company and to generate revenues will depend heavily on royalty payments from the commercial sale of erivedge and the ability of erivedge to be approved for commercial sale by the ema  which would result in us becoming eligible to receive additional milestone payments as well as royalties on any future sales 
moreover  we have historically derived a substantial portion of our revenue from the research funding portion of our collaboration agreements 
however  we have no current source of research funding revenue 
we expect that our only source of cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future will be up front license payments and research and development funding that we may receive if we are able to successfully enter into new collaboration agreements  contingent cash payments that we may receive for the achievement of development objectives under any new collaborations or our existing collaborations with genentech  debiopharm and the lls  and royalty payments that are contingent upon the successful commercialization of products based upon these collaborations 
we may not be able to successfully enter into or continue any corporate collaborations and the timing  amount and likelihood of us receiving payments under such collaborations is highly uncertain 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will attain any further revenue under any collaborations or licensing arrangements 
we anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and working capital at december   should enable us to maintain current and planned operations into the second half of  including the  milestone we earned in january upon fda approval of erivedge 
our future capital requirements  however  may vary from what we currently expect 
there are a number of factors that may adversely affect our planned future capital requirements and accelerate our need for additional financing  many of which are outside our control  including the following unanticipated costs in our research and development programs  the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  the timing  receipt and amount of payments  if any  from current and potential future collaborators  
table of contents the timing and amount of payments due to licensors of patent rights and technology used in our drug candidates  unplanned costs to prepare  file  prosecute  maintain and enforce patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and technology license fees  and unexpected losses in our cash investments or an inability to otherwise liquidate our cash investments due to unfavorable conditions in the capital markets 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of debt or equity  including  but not limited to  sales under our atm agreement with mlv 
for example  in june we entered into an agreement with mlv pursuant to which  from time to time  we may offer and sell up to million of common stock through mlv pursuant to one or more at the market offerings 
in addition  with our prior written approval  mlv may also sell these shares of common stock by any other method permitted by law  including in privately negotiated transactions 
the market for emerging life science stocks in general  and the market for our common stock in particular  are highly volatile 
due to this and various other factors  including currently adverse general market conditions and the early stage status of our development pipeline  additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and we may not be able to sell additional shares under the arrangement with mlv at favorable prices 
in addition  the terms of any financing may be dilutive or otherwise adversely affect other rights of our stockholders 
we also expect to seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators  licensees or other third parties 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  whether through sales of debt or equity or through third party collaboration or license arrangements  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our development programs  including some or all of our drug candidates 
contractual obligations as of december   we had future payments required under contractual obligations and other commitments  including an operating lease related to our facility  research services agreements  consulting agreements  and license agreements  as follows payment due by period amounts in s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating lease obligations outside service obligations licensing obligations total future obligations effective september   we entered into a new lease agreement with the trustees of lexington office realty trust pursuant to which we have agreed to lease  square feet of property to be used for office  research and laboratory space located at maguire road in lexington  massachusetts  to which we relocated in december the term of the lease agreement commenced on december   and expires approximately seven years and two months from such date 
the total remaining cash obligation for the base rent over the initial term of the lease agreement is approximately  in addition to the base rent  we will also be responsible for our share of operating expenses and real estate taxes  in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement 
amounts include contractual rent payments and exclude any impact of an early termination payment as defined in the agreement 
outside service obligations consist of agreements we have with outside labs  consultants and various other service organizations 
obligations to clinical research organizations  medical centers and hospitals 
table of contents conducting our clinical trials are included in our financial statements for costs incurred as of december  our obligations under these types of arrangements are limited to actual costs incurred for services performed and do not include any contingent or milestone payments 
licensing obligations include only obligations that are known to us as of december  in the future  we may owe royalties and other contingent payments to our licensees based on the achievement of developmental milestones  product sales and specified other objectives 
for example  upon receipt of the  payment from genentech as a result of fda approval of erivedge in january  we will be obligated to make payments to our sublicensors totaling  or 
we will also be obligated to pay a total of of any royalties we receive upon the sale of erivedge to these sublicensors 
these future obligations are not reflected in the table above as these payments are contingent upon third party regulatory approval s and or commercial sales of erivedge  which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
contingent payments to sublicensors related to future development milestones would total  or  if all of the  in remaining milestones under our genentech collaboration are achieved 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our revenue and results of operations since inception 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in either case  a company is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
regardless of choice in presentation  the company is required to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
for public companies  the amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively with the exception of reclassification adjustments which are currently deferred while the fasb deliberates on this issue 
early adoption is permitted and we adopted this pronouncement in the fourth quarter of other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu which simplifies how companies test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in goodwill accounting standard 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect the new asu to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our current cash balances in excess of operating requirements are invested in cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions  short term commercial paper  and government obligations with an average maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are considered available for sale 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
this objective may be adversely affected by the ongoing economic downturn and volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
while as of the date of this filing  we are not aware of any downgrades  material losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents or marketable securities since december   no assurance can be given that further deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or marketable securities or our ability to meet our financing objectives 
further dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and or liquidity of marketable securities owned by us 
our investments are investment grade securities  and deposits are with investment grade financial institutions 
we believe that the realization of losses due to changes in credit spreads is unlikely as we currently have the ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to recover the fair value of the investment and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the fair value of the investment is recoverable 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a change in interest rate percentages would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio or our interest income
