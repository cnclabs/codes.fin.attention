using the cost to cost method  revenue is recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion  multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue  less the cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract using this method is equal to the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative revenue recognized  less the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract in prior periods 
as this method relies on the substantial use of estimates  these projections may be revised throughout the life of a contract 
components of this formula and ratio that may be estimated include gross profit margin and total costs at completion 
the cost performance and estimates to complete on long term contracts are reviewed  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis  as well as when information becomes available that would necessitate a review of the current estimate 
adjustments to estimates for a contract s estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss often are required as experience is gained  and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may or may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
the impact of such adjustments or changes to estimates is made on a cumulative basis in the period when such information has become known 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services  production efficiencies  price competition and general economic conditions 
revenue and profits on cost reimbursable type contracts are recognized as allowable costs are incurred on the contract at an amount equal to the allowable costs plus the estimated profit on those costs 
the estimated profit on a cost reimbursable contract may be fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement 
incentive and award fees on these contracts are recorded as revenue when the criteria under which they are earned are reasonably assured of being met and can be estimated 
for contracts whose anticipated total costs exceed total expected revenue  an estimated loss is recognized in the period when identifiable 
a provision for the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded on a cumulative basis 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is probable  and are determined on a percentage of completion basis measured by the cost to cost method 
inventories inventories  stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market  include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
griffon s businesses typically do not require inventory that is susceptible to becoming obsolete or dated 
in general  telephonics sells products in connection with programs authorized and approved under contracts awarded by the us government or agencies thereof  either as prime or subcontractor  and in accordance with customer specifications 
plastics primarily produces fabricated materials used by customers in the production of their products and these materials are produced against orders by those customers 
hbp produces doors and non powered lawn and garden tools in response to orders from customers of retailers and dealers or based on expected orders  as applicable 
warranty accruals direct customer and end user warranties are provided on certain products 
these warranties cover manufacturing defects that would prevent the product from performing in line with its intended and marketed use 
the terms of these warranties vary by product line and generally provide for the repair or replacement of the defective product 
warranty claims data is collected and analyzed with a focus on the historical amount of claims  the products involved  the amount of time between the warranty claims and the products respective sales and the amount of current sales 
based on these analyses  warranty accruals are generally recorded as an increase to cost of sales and regularly reviewed for adequacy 
stock based compensation griffon has issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers and directors in the form of stock options and restricted stock 
for stock option grants made on or after october   expense is recognized over the awards expected vesting period based on their fair value as calculated using the black scholes pricing model 
the black scholes pricing model uses estimated assumptions for a forfeiture rate  the expected life of the options and a volatility rate using historical data 
compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over the required service period based on the fair value of the grant calculated as the number of shares granted multiplied by the stock price on the date of grant  and for performance shares  the likelihood of achieving the performance criteria 
allowances for discount  doubtful account and returns trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less allowances for discounts  doubtful accounts and returns 
the allowances represent estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations usually due to customers potential insolvency  discounts related to early payment of accounts receivables by customers and estimates for returns 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified  as well as an amount for customer defaults based on a general formula when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with specific customers 
allowance for discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue and the provision related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in sg a expenses 
acquisitions acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires  among other things  that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d be recorded on the balance sheet 
related transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill  long lived intangible and tangible assets  and impairment griffon has significant intangible and tangible long lived assets on its balance sheet which includes goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
as required under gaap  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually  for griffon as of september  or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  using discounted future cash flows for each reporting unit 
the testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment involves significant use of judgment and assumptions in the determination of a reporting unit s fair market value 
based upon the results of the annual impairment review  it was determined that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the assets  and no impairment existed as of september  long lived amortizable intangible assets  such as customer relationships and software  and tangible assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  are amortized over their expected useful lives  which involves significant assumptions and estimates 
long lived intangible and tangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset when an impairment indicator  such as change in business  customer loss or obsolete technology  exists 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time  but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
any changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects  which may result from a decline in griffon s stock price  a change in market conditions  market trends  interest rates or other factors outside of griffon s control  or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of griffon s reporting units  which could result in an impairment charge in the future 
restructuring reserves from time to time  griffon will establish restructuring reserves at an operation 
these reserves for both termination and other exit costs require the use of estimates 
though griffon believes the estimates made are reasonable  they could differ materially from the actual costs 
income taxes griffon s effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which griffon operates 
for interim financial reporting  the annual tax rate is estimated based on projected taxable income for the full year and a quarterly income tax provision is recorded in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the year progresses  the estimates are refined based on the year s taxable income as new information becomes available  including year to date financial results 
this continual estimation process often results in a change to the effective tax rate throughout the year 
significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which a tax benefit has been recorded in the income statement 
the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income is assessed at least quarterly  and the valuation allowance  if any  is adjusted accordingly 
tax benefits are recognized for an uncertain tax position when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount that is judged to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
the liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized in the period in which they are identified 
the effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which griffon has recorded a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  griffon believes its liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate 
favorable resolution of an unrecognized tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in griffon s tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized tax benefit could increase the tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent 
however  if it is anticipated that a cash settlement will occur within one year  that portion of the liability is presented as current 
interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is recorded as income tax expense 
pension benefits griffon sponsors defined and supplemental benefit pension plans for certain employees and retired employees 
annual amounts relating to these plans are recorded based on actuarial projections  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases and turnover rates 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine pension liabilities and assets  as well as pension expense  are reviewed on an annual basis when modifications to assumptions are made based on current economic conditions and trends 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on the nature of the plans investments and expectations for long term rates of return 
the discount rate used to measure obligations is based on a corporate bond spot rate yield curve that matches projected future benefit payments with the appropriate spot rate applicable to the timing of the projected future benefit payments 
the assumptions utilized in recording griffon s obligations under the defined benefit pension plans are believed to be reasonable based on experience and advice from independent actuaries  however  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect griffon s financial position or results of operations 
the us components of the defined benefit plans  which excludes the supplemental and post retirement healthcare and insurance benefit plans  are frozen and have stopped accruing benefits 
effective january   the clopay pension plan merged with the ames true temper inc pension plan 
the merged qualified defined benefit plans was named the clopay ames true temper plan catt plan 
the att supplemental executive retirement plan was frozen to new entrants and participants in the plan stopped accruing benefits in newly issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new accounting rules eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the new accounting rules will be effective for the company in and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles 
this guidance is effective for the company in and is not expected to have an impact on the company s financial condition or result of operations 
recently issued effective accounting pronouncements none item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates griffon s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to variable interest rate debt and investments in cash and equivalents 
the revolving credit facility and certain other of griffon s credit facilities have a libor based variable interest rate 
due to the current and expected level of borrowings under these facilities  a basis point change in libor would not have a material impact on griffon s results of operations or liquidity 
foreign exchange griffon conducts business in various non us countries  primarily in canada  mexico  europe  brazil  turkey  china  sweden  australia and mexico  therefore  changes in the value of the currencies of these countries affect the financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
griffon has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements relative to its non us operations 
griffon may  from time to time  hedge its currency risk exposures 
a change of or less in the value of all applicable foreign currencies would not have a material effect on griffon s financial position and cash flows
