item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in multi family and commercial real estate related bridge loans  junior participating interests in first mortgages  mezzanine loans  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we have also invested in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets decreases or the cost of borrowings increases  this will have a negative impact on earnings 
however  if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size and performance of our asset portfolio 
see current market conditions  risks and recent trends below for risks and trends of our net interest income 
credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings and liquidity 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
if there are increases in foreclosures and non performing loans and investments  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses and asset management related expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
additionally  under the terms of our junior subordinated note agreements  annual dividends are limited to of taxable income to common shareholders and are required to be paid in the form of our stock to the maximum extent permissible currently  with the balance payable in cash 
we will be permitted to pay of our taxable income in cash if we pay the note holders the original rate of interest upon early termination of the agreement or at its expiration in april certain reit income may be subject to state and local income taxes 
our assets or operations that would not otherwise comply with the reit requirements  are owned or conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income tax 
under current federal tax law  the gain and the tax on the gain of certain debt extinguishment transactions realized in and have been deferred to future periods at our election 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of estimated state income 
table of contents taxes incurred in those states that do not adopt the federal tax law that allows us to elect to defer income generated from certain debt extinguishment transactions 
for the years ended december   and  we did not record a current provision for income taxes related to the assets that are held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
current market conditions  risks and recent trends global stock and credit markets have experienced prolonged price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions over the past several years  which have caused market prices of many stocks to fluctuate substantially 
commercial real estate has been particularly adversely affected by the prolonged economic downturn 
although we have seen some improvements  the overall market recovery remains uncertain 
should the market regress  the commercial real estate sector may experience additional losses  challenges in complying with the terms of financing agreements  difficulty in raising capital  and challenges in obtaining investment financing with attractive terms or at all 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets and have resulted in the scarcity of certain types of financing  and  in certain cases  making terms for certain financings less attractive 
if these conditions persist  lending institutions may be forced to exit markets such as repurchase lending  become insolvent  further tighten their lending standards or increase the amount of equity capital required to obtain financing  and in such event  could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing for our investments 
a prolonged downturn in the stock or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing  and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly 
in addition  these factors may make it more difficult for our borrowers to repay our loans as they may experience difficulties in selling assets  increased costs of financing or obtaining financing at all 
these events in the stock and credit markets may also make it more difficult or unlikely for us to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock 
these disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and other adverse effects on us or the economy in general 
this environment has had a significant impact on our business  our borrowers and real estate values throughout all asset classes and geographic locations 
if real estate values decline  it may limit our new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use increases in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase or investment in additional properties 
borrowers may also be less able to pay principal and interest on our loans 
declining real estate values may also significantly increase the likelihood that we will continue to incur losses on our loans in the event of default because the value of our collateral may be insufficient to cover our cost on the loan 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originate  sell and securitize loans  which would significantly impact our revenues  results of operations  financial condition  business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  our investments are also subject to the risks described above with respect to commercial real estate loans and mortgage backed securities and similar risks  including risks of delinquency and foreclosure  the dependence upon the successful operation of  and net income from  real property  risks generally related to interests in real property  and risks that may be presented by the type and use of a particular commercial property 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses  due to declining collateral values  million in net recoveries of reserves  and million of loss on sale and restructuring of loans 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses  due to declining collateral values  million in net recoveries of reserves  and million of loss on sale and restructuring of loans 
during fiscal year  we recorded million of new provisions for loan losses and million of loss on sale and restructuring of loans 
in addition  we acquired two new real estate owned properties through a transfer from a creditor trust and a 
table of contents purchase out of bankruptcy  respectively  in the first quarter of we also acquired one new real estate owned property through deed in lieu of foreclosure and sold a real estate property held for sale in we have made  and continue to make modifications and extensions to loans when it is economically feasible to do so 
in some cases  a modification is a more viable alternative to foreclosure proceedings when a borrower cannot comply with loan terms 
in doing so  lower borrower interest rates  combined with non performing loans  will lower our net interest margins when comparing interest income to our costs of financing 
these trends may persist with a prolonged economic downturn and we feel if they do  there will be continued modifications and delinquencies in the foreseeable future  which may result in reduced net interest margins and additional losses throughout our sector 
commercial real estate financing companies were severely impacted by the economic downturn and until relatively recently have had very little access to the capital markets or the debt markets in order to meet their existing obligations or to refinance maturing debt 
we responded to these troubled times by decreasing investment activity for capital preservation  aggressively managing our assets through restructuring and extending our debt facilities and repurchasing our previously issued debt at discounts when economically feasible 
in order to accomplish these goals  we have worked closely with our borrowers in restructuring our loans  receiving payoffs and paydowns and monetizing our investments as appropriate 
additionally  based on available liquidity and market opportunities  we have from time to time repurchased our debt at discounts as well as shares of our common stock 
we will continue to remain focused on executing these strategies when appropriate and where available if this significant economic downturn persists 
refer to item a risk factors above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below for additional risk factors 
sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making real estate related bridge  mezzanine and junior participation loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
interest income may also be derived from profits on equity participation interests 
no such interest income was recognized in  and we also derive interest income from our investments in commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation cdo bond securities  commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and residential mortgage backed securities rmbs 
interest on these investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
property operating income is derived from our real estate owned assets 
in  property operating income represented approximately  of our total revenue 
the operation of a portfolio of hotel properties that we own is seasonal with the majority of revenues earned in the first two quarters of the calendar year 
no such income was recognized in and additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and defeasance fees  and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented approximately of our total revenues in  and income or loss from equity affiliates and gain or loss on sale of loans and real estate we derive income or loss from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are 
table of contents recorded under either the equity or cost method of accounting as appropriate 
we record our share of net income and losses from the underlying properties of our equity method investments and any other than temporary impairment of these investments on a single line item in the consolidated statements of operations as income or loss from equity affiliates 
in  income from equity affiliates was million while in and  loss from equity affiliates totaled million and million  respectively 
we also may derive income or loss from the sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt or for investment in order to stabilize the property and dispose of it for a future anticipated return 
we may also acquire real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
in  we sold a real estate held for sale property acquired by a foreclosure sale to a third party for net proceeds of approximately million and recorded a gain of million 
no such gain or loss was recorded in or significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification  the authoritative reference for accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
loans  investments and securities loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that  in some cases  allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
from time to time  we may enter into an agreement to sell a loan 
these loans are considered held for sale and are valued at the lower of the loan s carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
for the sale of loans  recognition occurs when ownership passes to the buyer 
at the time of purchase  we designate a security as available for sale  held to maturity  or trading depending on our ability and intent to hold it to maturity 
we do not have any securities designated as trading as of december  securities available for sale are reported at fair value with the net unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
unrealized losses that are 
table of contents determined to be other than temporary are recognized in earnings up to their credit component 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions 
the process may include  but is not limited to  assessment of recent market events and prospects for near term recovery  assessment of cash flows  internal review of the underlying assets securing the investments  credit of the issuer and the rating of the security  as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
management closely monitors market conditions on which it bases such decisions 
we also assess certain of our securities  other than those of high credit quality  to determine whether significant changes in estimated cash flows or unrealized losses on these securities  if any  reflect a decline in value which is other than temporary and  accordingly  should be written down to their fair value against earnings 
on a quarterly basis  we review these changes in estimated cash flows  which could occur due to actual prepayment and credit loss experience  to determine if an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process requiring judgments and assumptions and is not necessarily intended to indicate a permanent decline in value 
we calculate a revised yield based on the current amortized cost of the investment  including any other than temporary impairments recognized to date  and the revised yield is then applied prospectively to recognize interest income 
impaired loans  allowance for loan losses  loss on sale and restructuring of loans and charge offs loans are considered impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we evaluate each loan in our portfolio on a quarterly basis 
our loans are individually specific and unique as it relates to product type  geographic location  and collateral type  as well as to the rights and remedies and the position in the capital structure our loans and investments have in relation to the underlying collateral 
we evaluate all of this information as well as general market trends related to specific classes of assets  collateral type and geographic locations  when determining the appropriate assumptions such as capitalization and market discount rates  as well as the borrower s operating income and cash flows  in estimating the value of the underlying collateral when determining if a loan is impaired 
we utilize internally developed valuation models and techniques primarily consisting of discounted cash flow and direct capitalization models in determining the fair value of the underlying collateral on an individual loan 
we may also obtain a third party appraisal  which may value the collateral through an as is or stabilized value methodology 
such appraisals may be used as an additional source of valuation information only and no adjustments are made to appraisals 
included in the evaluation of the capitalization and market discount rates  we consider not only assumptions specific to the collateral but also geographical and industry trends that could impact the collateral s value 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for each loan is maintained at a level that is believed to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
we had a million allowance for loan losses at december  related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before loan loss reserves 
at december   we had a million allowance for loan losses related to loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before loan loss reserves 
loan terms may be modified if we determine that based on the individual circumstances of a loan and the underlying collateral  a modification would more likely increase the total recovery of the combined principal and interest from the loan 
any loan modification is predicated upon a goal of maximizing the collection of the loan 
typical triggers for a modification would include situations where the projected cash flow is insufficient to cover required debt service  when asset performance is lagging 
table of contents the initial projections  where there is a requirement for rebalancing  where there is an impending maturity of the loan  and where there is an actual loan default 
loan terms that have been modified have included  but are not limited to interest rate  maturity date and in certain cases  principal amount 
length and amounts of each modification have varied based on individual circumstances and are determined on a case by case basis 
if the loan modification constitutes a concession whereas we do not receive ample consideration in return for the modification  and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and cannot repay the loan under the current terms  then the modification is considered by us to be a troubled debt restructuring 
if we receive a benefit  either monetary or strategic  and the above criteria are not met  the modification is not considered to be a troubled debt restructuring 
we record interest on modified loans on an accrual basis to the extent that the modified loan is contractually current 
to date  we have not recorded interest income on a modified loan where we have not subsequently received the cash 
loss on restructured loans are recorded when we grant a concession to a borrower in the form of principal forgiveness related to a payoff or the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower or when we incur costs on behalf of the borrower related to the modification  payoff or the substitution or addition of a new debtor for the original borrower 
when a loan is restructured  we record the investment at net realizable value  taking into account the cost of all concessions at the date of restructuring 
the reduction in the recorded investment is recorded as a charge to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the loan is restructured 
in addition  a gain or loss may be recorded upon the sale of a loan to a third party as a charge to the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the loan was sold 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded loss on sale and restructuring of loans of million  million and million  respectively 
charge offs to the allowance for loan losses occur when losses are confirmed through the receipt of cash or other consideration from the completion of a sale  when a modification or restructuring takes place in which we grant a concession to a borrower or agree to a discount in full or partial satisfaction of the loan  when we take ownership and control of the underlying collateral in full satisfaction of the loan  when loans are reclassified as other investments  or when significant collection efforts have ceased and it is highly likely that a loss has been realized 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded charge offs to the allowance for loan losses of million  million and million  respectively 
real estate owned and held for sale real estate owned  shown net of accumulated depreciation and impairment charges  is comprised of real property acquired by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt 
the real estate acquired is recorded at the estimated fair value at the time of acquisition 
costs incurred in connection with the foreclosure of the properties collateralizing the real estate loans are expensed as incurred and costs subsequently incurred to extend the life or improve the assets subsequent to foreclosure are capitalized 
we allocate the purchase price of operating properties to land  building  tenant improvements  deferred lease cost for the origination costs of the in place leases  intangibles for the value of the above or below market leases at fair value and to any other identified intangible assets or liabilities 
we finalize the purchase price allocation on these assets within one year of the acquisition date 
we amortize the value allocated to the in place leases over the remaining lease term 
the value allocated to the above or below market leases are amortized over the remaining lease term as an adjustment to rental income 

table of contents real estate assets  including assets acquired by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt that are operated for the production of income are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
ordinary repairs and maintenance which are not reimbursed by the tenants are expensed as incurred 
major replacements and betterments which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
our properties are individually reviewed for impairment each quarter  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we recognize impairment if the undiscounted estimated cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
measurement of impairment is based upon the estimated fair value of the assets 
upon evaluating a property for impairment  many factors are considered  including estimated current and expected operating cash flows from the property during the projected holding period  costs necessary to extend the life or improve the asset  expected capitalization rates  projected stabilized net operating income  selling costs  and the ability to hold and dispose of such real estate owned in the ordinary course of business 
valuation adjustments may be necessary in the event that effective interest rates  rent up periods  future economic conditions  and other relevant factors vary significantly from those assumed in valuing the property 
if future evaluations result in a diminution in the value of the property  the reduction will be recognized as an impairment charge at that time 
real estate is classified as held for sale when management commits to a plan of sale  the asset is available for immediate sale  there is an active program to locate a buyer  and it is probable the sale will be complete within one year 
properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated and the results of their operations are shown in discontinued operations 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued  on an individual asset basis  at the lower of their carrying amount or their fair value less costs to sell 
we recognize sales of real estate properties upon closing 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits 
profit on real estate sold is recognized upon closing using the full accrual method when the collectability of the sale price is reasonably assured and we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale 
profit may be deferred in whole or in part until collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is complete 
revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and securities 
in certain instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  a prepayment fee and or deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases  interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising from the purchase or origination of the loan or security 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management a full recovery of all contractual principal is not probable 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is resumed 
we record interest income on certain impaired loans to the extent cash is received  in which a loan loss reserve has been recorded  as the borrower continue to make interest payments 
we recorded loan loss reserves related to these loans as it was deemed that full recovery of principal and interest was not probable 
several of our loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
we currently have no 
table of contents loans in our portfolio accruing such interest 
therefore  interest income is recorded on all of our loans and investments only to the extent that the current pay rate is received 
given the transitional nature of some of our real estate loans  we may require funds to be placed into an interest reserve  based on contractual requirements  to cover debt service costs 
we will analyze these interest reserves on a periodic basis and determine if any additional interest reserves are needed 
recognition of income on loans with funded interest reserves are accounted for in the same manner as loans without funded interest reserves 
we will not recognize any interest income on loans in which the borrower has failed to make the contractual interest payment due or has not replenished the interest reserve account 
as of december   we had total interest reserves of million on loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million and had three non performing loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million with a funded interest reserve of million 
income from non performing loans is generally recognized on a cash basis only to the extent it is received 
full income recognition will resume when the loan becomes contractually current and performance has recommenced 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flow distributions and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
we did not record interest income on such investments for the years ended december   or property operating income 
property operating income represents income associated with the operation of commercial real estate properties classified as real estate owned 
we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable  or are evidenced by an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of property operating income relating to real estate owned properties 
we did not have property operating income in and as of december   we had two real estate owned properties 
this was due to a portfolio of multifamily assets that was purchased by us out of bankruptcy and a portfolio of hotel assets that was transferred to us by the owner  a creditor trust 
both of these portfolios were acquired in the first quarter of additionally  real estate investments were reclassified from real estate owned to real estate held for sale in  and  resulting in the reclassification of all of the operating activity from these properties from property operating income and expenses into discontinued operations for all prior periods 
for more details see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
stock based compensation we have granted certain of our employees  directors  and employees of acm  restricted stock awards consisting of shares of our common stock that vest immediately or annually over a multi year period  subject to the recipient s continued service to us 
we record stock based compensation expense at the grant date fair value of the related stock based award with subsequent remeasurement for any unvested shares granted to non employees 
such amounts are expensed against earnings  at the grant date for the portion that vests immediately or ratably over the respective vesting periods 
dividends are paid on the restricted shares as dividends are paid on shares of our common stock whether or not they are vested 
stock based compensation is disclosed in our consolidated statement of operations under employee compensation and benefits for employees and under selling and administrative expense for non employees 
income taxes we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to 
table of contents federal income tax on taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders  provided that at least of its taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain reit income may be subject to state and local income taxes 
our assets or operations that would not otherwise comply with the reit requirements  are owned or conducted by our taxable reit subsidiaries  the income of which is subject to federal and state income tax 
under current federal tax law  the income and the tax on such income attributable to certain debt extinguishment transactions realized in and have been deferred to future periods at our election 
current accounting guidance clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides clarity on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
variable interest entities we have evaluated our loans and investments  mortgage related securities  investments in equity affiliates  junior subordinated notes and cdos  in order to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities vies or as variable interests in vies 
this evaluation resulted in our determination that our bridge loans  junior participation loans  mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments  investments in equity affiliates  junior subordinated notes  cdos  and investments in mortgage related securities are potential vies 
a vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors i do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  and or ii do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties 
a vie is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary  which is defined as the party that i has the power to control the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we consolidate our three cdo subsidiaries  which qualify as vies  of which we are the primary beneficiary 
these cdos invest in real estate and real estate related securities and are financed by the issuance of cdo debt securities 
we  or one of our affiliates  is named collateral manager  servicer  and special servicer for all cdo collateral assets which we believes gives us the power to direct the most significant economic activities of the entity 
we also have exposure to cdo losses to the extent of our equity interests and also have rights to waterfall payments in excess of required payments to cdo bond investors 
as a result of consolidation  equity interests in these cdos have been eliminated  and the consolidated balance sheet reflects both the assets held and debt issued by the cdos to third parties 
our operating results and cash flows include the gross amounts related to cdo assets and liabilities as opposed to our net economic interests in the cdo entities 
as of december   we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of vies in which we have a variable interest 
these vies had an aggregate carrying amount of million and exposure to real estate debt of approximately billion at december  for all other investments  we have determined they are not vies or variable interests in vies 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
a summary of our identified vies or variable interests in vies is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 

table of contents derivatives and hedging activities the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
additionally  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether a company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting 
during the year ended december   we entered into a libor cap with a notional value of approximately million that was designated as a cash flow hedge and a libor cap with a notional value of approximately million that was not designated as a cash flow hedge 
in addition  the notional value on four basis swaps decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreements  the notional value on two interest rate swaps decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreements  and six interest rate swaps matured with a combined notional value of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we entered into two new interest rate swaps that qualify as cash flow hedges with a combined notional value of approximately million and one libor cap with a notional value of approximately million that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge 
in addition  the notional values on one basis swap decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreement  the notional value on two interest rate swaps decreased by approximately million pursuant to the contractual terms of the respective swap agreements  and six interest rate swaps matured with a combined notional value of approximately million 
we also recorded a loss of million on the termination of the interest rate swaps related to the restructured trust preferred securities directly to loss on terminated swaps in the second quarter of as the interest rate swaps were determined to no longer be effective or necessary due to the modified interest payment structure of the newly issued unsecured junior subordinated notes 
refer to the section titled liquidity and capital resources junior subordinated notes below 
gains and losses on termination swaps are deferred and recognized in interest expense over the original life of the hedged item 
the fair value of our qualifying hedge portfolio has increased by approximately million from december  as a result of the maturities and amortized notional values of swaps  combined with a change in the projected libor rates and credit spreads of both parties 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see interest rate risk in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  set forth in item a hereof 

table of contents fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current transaction between knowledgeable  willing parties 
a liability s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor  not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor 
where available  fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters 
where observable prices or inputs are not available  valuation models are applied 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instruments complexity 
assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value 
hierarchical levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows level inputs are unadjusted and quoted prices exist in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
the types of assets and liabilities carried at level fair value generally are government and agency securities  equities listed in active markets  investments in publicly traded mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives 
level inputs other than quoted prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs include quoted market prices in markets that are not active for an identical or similar asset or liability  and quoted market prices in active markets for a similar asset or liability 
fair valued assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are non government securities  municipal bonds  certain hybrid financial instruments  certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain commitments and guarantees  certain private equity investments and certain derivatives 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
these valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs that require a considerable amount of judgment and assumptions 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
generally  assets and liabilities carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and asset backed securities  certain corporate debt  certain private equity investments  certain municipal bonds  certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives 
determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment and we evaluate our hierarchy disclosures each quarter 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis  including available for sale securities and derivative financial instruments 
the fair values of our available for sale securities are approximated based on current market quotes received from financial sources that trade such securities 
the fair values of certain cdo and cmbs securities are estimated by us using level inputs that require significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates  leasing  creditworthiness of major tenants  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  loan sponsorship  actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management 
in addition  fair values of our derivative financial instruments are approximated based on current market data received from financial sources that trade such instruments and are based on prevailing market data and derived from third party proprietary models based on well recognized financial principles and reasonable estimates about relevant future market conditions 
these items are 
table of contents included in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments in the fair values of our derivative financial instruments to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk 
at december   we measured certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  including loans and real estate held for sale investments 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  loan purchase discounts  and net of the allowance for loan losses when such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we consider a loan impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due for both principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we perform evaluations of our loans to determine if the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  which may result in an allowance and corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
these valuations require significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding capitalization rates  leasing  creditworthiness of major tenants  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  loan sponsorship  actions of other lenders and other factors deemed necessary by management 
in addition  real estate investments held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less costs to sell 
measurement of fair value requires significant judgments  which include assumptions regarding cash flows  capitalization rates  occupancy rates  availability of financing  exit plan  and other factors deemed necessary by management as well as discussions with active market participants

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity liquidity is a measurement of the ability to meet potential cash requirements 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future loans and investments  fund additional cash collateral from potential declines in the value of a portion of our interest rate swaps  fund operating costs and distributions to our stockholders as well as other general business needs 
our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of proceeds from equity offerings  debt facilities and cash flows from our operations 
our equity sources  depending on market conditions  consist of proceeds from capital market transactions including the future issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
our debt facilities include the issuance of floating rate notes resulting from our cdos  the issuance of junior subordinated notes and borrowings under credit agreements 
net cash flows from operations include interest income from our loan and investment portfolio reduced by interest expense on our debt facilities  cash from other investments reduced by expenses  repayments of outstanding loans and investments and funds from junior loan participation arrangements 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term and long term liquidity needs 
a majority of our loans and investments are financed under existing debt obligations and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
current conditions in the capital and credit markets have made certain forms of financing less attractive and  in certain cases  less available 
therefore  we will continue to rely on cash flows provided by operating and investing activities for working capital 
to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our reit taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements 
under current irs guidance  a listed reit may offer shareholders elective stock dividends  which are paid in a combination of cash and common stock with at least of the total distribution paid in cash  to satisfy future dividend requirements

we paid an incentive management fee for the twelve month period ending december  to acm in a combination of cash and shares of common stock during the first quarter of we issued  shares of common stock in march for the portion of the incentive management fee paid in common stock 
in june  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec under the act with respect to an aggregate of million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants  that may be sold by us from time to time pursuant to rule of the act

these debt facilities are described in further detail in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item hereof 
repurchase agreements and credit facilities repurchase obligation financings provide us with a revolving component to our debt structure 
repurchase agreements provide stand alone financing for certain assets and interim  or warehouse financing  for assets that we plan to contribute to our cdos 
during the year ended december   we financed the purchase of seven rmbs investments with a repurchase agreement with a financial institution for a total of million 
during  we paid down the debt by a total of million due to principal paydowns received on the rmbs investments  reducing the total debt amount to million at december  the facility finances to of the value of each individual investment  has a rolling monthly term  and bears interest at a rate of to basis points over libor 
the facility also includes a minimum net worth covenant of million and the outstanding balance reflects the seven investments currently financed in the facility 
in july  we entered into a two year  million warehouse facility with a financial institution to finance first mortgage loans on multifamily properties 
the facility bears interest at a rate of basis points over libor  required a commitment fee upon closing  matures in july with a one year extension option that requires two paydowns and has warehousing and non use fees

we also had a repurchase agreement with a financial institution that bore interest at basis points over libor and had a term expiring in june this facility did not have financial covenants and had a committed amount of million at march  reflecting the one asset that was financed 
in june  we repaid the facility in full 
cdos we completed the formation of three separate cdo entities since by issuing to third party investors  tranches of investment grade collateralized debt obligations through newly formed wholly owned subsidiaries the issuers 
the issuers hold assets  consisting primarily of real estate related assets and cash which serve as collateral for the cdos 
the assets pledged as collateral for the cdos were contributed from our portfolio of assets 
by contributing these real estate assets to the various cdos  these transactions resulted in a decreased cost of funds relating to the corresponding cdo assets and created capacity in our debt facilities 
the issuers issued tranches of investment grade floating rate notes of approximately million  million and million for cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii  respectively 
cdo iii also has a million revolving note which was not drawn upon at the time of issuance 
the revolving note facility has a commitment fee of per annum on the undrawn portion of the facility 
the tranches were issued with floating rate coupons based on three month libor plus pricing of 
proceeds from the sale of the investment grade tranches issued in cdo i  cdo ii and cdo iii of million  million and million  respectively  were used to repay higher costing outstanding debt under our repurchase agreements and notes payable 
the cdos could be replenished with substitute collateral for loans that are repaid during the first four years for cdo i and the first five years for cdo ii and cdo iii  subject to certain customary provisions 
thereafter  the outstanding debt balance will be reduced as loans are repaid 
proceeds from the repayment of assets which serve as collateral for the cdos must be retained in its structure as restricted cash until such collateral can be replaced and therefore are not available to fund current cash needs 
if such cash is not used to replenish collateral  it could have a negative impact on our anticipated returns 
as of april   cdo ii reached the end of its replenishment date and will no longer make quarterly amortization payments of million to investors as a reduction of the cdo liability and as of april   cdo i reached the end of its replenishment date and will no longer make quarterly amortization payments of million to investors 
as of january   cdo iii has reached the end of its replenishment date 
investor capital will be repaid quarterly from proceeds received from loan repayments held as collateral in accordance with the terms of the cdo 
proceeds distributed will be recorded as a reduction of the cdo liability

the economic difficulties over the last several years in the structured finance markets has negatively impacted the credit markets generally  and  as a result  investor demand for commercial real estate collateralized debt obligations has been substantially curtailed 
in recent years  we have relied to a substantial extent on cdo financings to obtain match funded financing for our investments 
until the market for commercial real estate cdos recovers  we may be unable to utilize cdos to finance our future investments and we may need to utilize less favorable sources of financing to finance our investments on a long term basis 
there can be no assurance as to when demand for commercial real estate cdos will return or the terms of such securities investors will demand or whether we will be able to issue cdos to finance our investments on terms beneficial to us

credit risk assets are reported by each of the cdos and are generally defined as one that  in the cdo collateral manager s reasonable business judgment  has a significant risk of declining in credit quality or  with a passage of time  becoming a defaulted asset 

table of contents our cdo vehicles contain interest coverage and asset over collateralization covenants that must be met as of the waterfall distribution date in order for us to receive such payments 
if we fail these covenants in any of our cdos  all cash flows from the applicable cdo would be diverted to repay principal and interest on the outstanding cdo bonds and we would not receive any residual payments until that cdo regained compliance with such tests 
our cdos were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  as well as on the most recent determination date in january in the event of a breach of the cdo covenants that could not be cured in the near term  we would be required to fund our non cdo expenses  including management fees and employee costs  distributions required to maintain reit status  debt costs  and other expenses with i cash on hand  ii income from any cdo not in breach of a covenant test  iii income from real property and loan assets  iv sale of assets  v or accessing the equity or debt capital markets  if available 
we have the right to cure covenant breaches which would resume normal residual payments to us by purchasing non performing loans out of the cdos

to the extent an asset is considered a defaulted security  the asset s principal balance for purposes of the overcollateralization test  is the lesser of the asset s market value or the principal balance of the defaulted asset multiplied by the asset s recovery rate which is determined by the rating agencies 
rating downgrades of cdo collateral will generally not have a direct impact on the principal balance of a cdo asset for purposes of calculating the cdo s overcollateralization test unless the rating downgrade is below a significantly low threshold eg ccc as defined in each cdo vehicle 
the interest coverage ratio divides interest income by interest expense for the classes senior to those retained by us

cash flow from operations we continually monitor our cash position to determine the best use of funds to both maximize our return on funds and maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
historically  in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations has generally been used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
consequently  when making distributions in the past  we have borrowed the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
since we have substantially reduced our short term debt  we may have to maintain adequate liquidity from operations to make any future distributions

management agreement we  arlp and arbor realty sr  inc have a management agreement with acm  pursuant to which acm provides certain services and we pay acm a base management fee and under certain circumstances  an annual incentive fee 
on august   we amended our management agreement with acm effective as of january  the amendment was negotiated by a special committee of our board of directors  consisting solely of independent directors and was approved unanimously by all of the independent directors 
the base management fee is an arrangement whereby we reimburse acm for its actual costs incurred in managing our business based on the parties agreement in advance on an annual budget with subsequent quarterly true ups to actual costs 
the  and base management fees were million  million and million  respectively  and the base management fee is estimated to be approximately million 
all origination fees on investments are now retained by us 
the incentive fee is calculated as of the amount by which a our funds from operations per share  adjusted for certain gains and losses including gains from the retirement and restructuring of debt and of any loan loss reserve recoveries spread over a three year period  exceeds b the product of x per annum or the ten year us treasury rate plus  whichever is greater  and y the greater of or the weighted average of book value of the net assets contributed by acm to arlp per arlp partnership unit  the offering price per share of our common equity in the private offering on july  and subsequent offerings and the issue price per arlp partnership unit for subsequent contributions to arlp  multiplied by the weighted average of our outstanding shares 

table of contents the minimum return  or incentive fee hurdle  to be reached before an incentive fee is earned  is a percentage applied on a per share basis to the greater of or the average gross proceeds per share 
in addition  of any loan loss and other reserve recoveries are eligible to be included in the incentive fee calculation  which recoveries are spread over a three year period 
the management agreement also allows us to consider  from time to time  the payment of additional success based fees to acm for accomplishing certain specified corporate objectives  has a termination fee of million  and is renewable automatically for successive one year terms  unless terminated with six months prior written notice 
we incurred million and million of base management fees for services rendered in and  respectively  and million  or per basic and diluted common share  of base management fees for services rendered in the million in consisted of million in base management fees  a million retroactive payment for costs  and success based payments which were paid for the trust preferred and wachovia debt restructurings totaling million 
no success based payments were made for the years ended december  and the incentive fee is measured on an annual basis 
however  when applicable  we pay the annual incentive fee in quarterly installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the twelve months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive fee are deemed to be an advance subject to potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year  and any overpayments are required to be repaid in accordance with the amended management agreement 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive fee is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive fee is being paid 
for the twelve month period ending december   acm earned an incentive management fee of million  which was included in due to related party as of december  as provided for in the management agreement  we offset the balance of a prepaid management fee receivable of million as of december   and acm elected to be paid the remaining incentive management fee in  shares of our common stock and million in cash  which was subsequently remitted in for the years ended december  and  acm did not earn an incentive management fee 
as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources notes payable above  on june   we closed on the discounted payoff agreement with wachovia and retired all of our debt with wachovia at the discount described 
the successful completion of the retirement of the wachovia debt was a significant contributor to an incentive fee for the manager in as indicated earlier  gains on the extinguishment of debt are included in the incentive fee calculation and the gain  net of fees  certain expenses  and taxes  attributable to the wachovia transaction was million 
additionally  in  acm received an incentive fee installment totaling million which was recorded as a prepaid management fee related to the incentive fee on million of deferred revenue recognized on the transfer of control of the west rd street property  one of our equity affiliates 
the incentive fee is accrued as it is earned 
the expense incurred for the incentive fee paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive fee paid to acm in the form of common stock in accordance with current accounting guidance  which discusses how to determine the expense when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  any expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the total incentive fee is determined 
in the event that the incentive fee for the full year is an amount less than the total of the installment payments made to acm for the year  acm will refund the amount of such 
table of contents overpayment to us in cash regardless of whether such installments were paid in cash or common stock 
in such a case  we would record a negative incentive fee expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined 
inflation changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
however  the significant decline in interest rates in the past triggered libor floors on certain of our variable rate interest earning assets 
this resulted in an increase in interest rate spreads on certain assets as the rates we pay on variable rate interest bearing liabilities declined at a greater pace than the rates we earned on our variable rate interest earning assets 
the number of loans impacted by libor floors have significantly decreased over this time as a majority of the loans with such floors were paid off  monetized  modified or restructured 
additionally  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be affected

non gaap financial measures funds from operations we are presenting funds from operations ffo because we believe it to be an important supplemental measure of our operating performance in that it is frequently used by analysts  investors and other parties in the evaluation of real estate investment trusts reits 
the revised white paper on ffo approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  in april defines ffo as net income loss attributable to arbor realty trust  inc computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of depreciated real properties  plus impairments of depreciated real properties and real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments

we consider gains and losses on the sales of undepreciated real estate investments to be a normal part of our recurring operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be excluded when calculating ffo 
in accordance with the revised white paper  losses from discontinued operations are not excluded when calculating ffo 
ffo is not intended to be an indication of our cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap or a measure of our liquidity  nor is it entirely indicative of funding our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
our calculation of ffo may be different from the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

adjusted book value we believe that adjusted book value per share is an additional appropriate measure given the magnitude and the deferral structure of the west rd street transaction from  as well as the changes in the fair value of certain derivative instruments 
adjusted book value per share currently reflects the future impact of the west rd street transaction on our financial condition as well as the evaluation of our operating results without the effects of unrealized losses from certain of our derivative instruments

we do not advocate that investors consider this non gaap financial measure in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk and interest rate risk 
market conditions we are subject to market changes in the debt and secondary mortgage markets 
these markets have experienced disruptions  which have and may in the future have an adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition 
current conditions in the debt markets include reduced liquidity and increased risk adjusted premiums 
these conditions may increase the cost and reduce the availability of debt 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of debt market disruptions by obtaining adequate debt facilities from a variety of financing sources 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in these efforts  that such debt facilities will be adequate or that the cost of such debt facilities will be at similar terms 
the secondary mortgage markets are still experiencing disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for collateralized debt obligations and increased investor yield requirements for these obligations 
in light of these conditions  we currently expect to finance a majority of our loan and investment portfolio with our current capital and debt facilities 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  events such as natural disasters including hurricanes and earthquakes  acts of war and or terrorism such as the events of september  and others that may cause unanticipated and uninsured performance declines and or losses to us or the owners and operators of the real estate securing our investment  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction delays  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reducing the value of collateral  and a lack of liquidity in the market  could reduce the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property s debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to 
table of contents hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
certain of these swaps are scheduled to mature on the original maturity dates of their corresponding loans 
however  loans are sometimes extended and  consequently  do not pay off on their original maturity dates 
if a loan is extended  whether it is through an existing extension option or a modification  our exposure to interest rate risk may be increased 
in these instances  we could have a fixed rate loan in our portfolio financed with variable debt and  since the corresponding interest swap already matured  a portion of our debt is no longer protected against interest rate risk 
some of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
one month libor approximated at december  and at december  based on our loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to a substantial portion of our portfolio having variable interest rates  partially offset by various interest rate floors that are in effect at a rate that is above a increase in libor which would limit the effect of a increase  and increased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans  securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans  securities and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to various interest rate floors which limit the effect of a decrease on interest income and decreased expense on variable rate debt  partially offset by our interest rate swaps that effectively converted a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease

in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in connection with our cdos described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor 
table of contents interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the cdo investor s return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
as of december  and  we had nine of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that had combined notional values of billion and billion  respectively 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by less than million for both periods 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by less than million for both periods 
we also have interest rate swap agreements outstanding to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
we had of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that had a combined notional value of million as of december  compared to interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million as of december  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had three libor caps with a combined notional value of million as of december compared to one libor cap with a notional value of million as of december if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of the libor caps would have increased by less than million for both periods 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates as of december  and  respectively  the value of the libor caps would have decreased by less than million for both periods 
certain of our interest rate swaps  which are designed to hedge interest rate risk associated with a portion of our loans and investments  could require the funding of additional cash collateral for changes in the market value of these swaps 
due to the prolonged volatility in the financial markets that began in  the value of these interest rate swaps has declined substantially 
as a result  at december  and  we funded approximately million and million  respectively  in cash related to these swaps 
if we continue to experience significant changes in the outlook of interest rates  these contracts could continue to decline in value  which would require additional cash to be funded 
however  at maturity the value of these contracts return to par and all cash will be recovered 
if we do not have available cash to meet these requirements  this could result in the early termination of these interest rate swaps  leaving us exposed to interest rate risk associated with these loans and investments  which could adversely impact our financial condition 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes
