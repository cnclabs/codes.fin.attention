critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies and estimates which are described below 
inventories 
our finished goods inventories at our retail stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
inventories other than finished goods at retail stores  called production inventory  primarily consists of piece goods  trim and work in process 
the company values production inventory at the lower of cost or market value using first in first out valuation method 
the company reviews the inventory for factors such as age  obsolescence  potential use  or other factors that may indicate a decline in its value 
the company records a reserve against the cost of the production inventory to account for any decline in its value 
finite long lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and exceeds the fair market value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 

table of contents the company evaluates finite lived assets in accordance with impairment or disposal of long lived assets under topic property  plant and equipment of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc 
finite lived assets are evaluated for recoverability in accordance with topic of the fasb asc whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset is recognized 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates

this is reevaluated annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if necessary 
the company considers many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the recorded goodwill will be recoverable 
factors used to make this determination primarily include declines in stock price and the market capitalization in relation to the book value of the company  discounted projected cash flows of the reporting unit and valuation of companies comparable to the reporting unit 
as a result of this testing  an impairment charge of million was recorded against the remaining carrying value of goodwill during fiscal comparatively  during fiscal  the company did not incur an impairment charge against the carrying value of goodwill

self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims up to certain thresholds 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
the company s earnings were impacted by an increase in employee health and welfare claims of  for fiscal  as compared with fiscal adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends were not significant for fiscal and we maintain stop loss insurance coverage which covers us for benefits paid in excess of limits as defined in the plan

the company has determined that redemption would be remote based on the fact that  by the fourteenth quarter since issue date  the redemption rate approximated  indicating that the probability of such merchandise credits and gift cards being redeemed is remote 
as such  we have recorded breakage income based upon the above criteria 
breakage income represents the balance of gift cards and merchandise credits for which the company believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote 
the company recorded breakage income of   and  during fiscal year ended  and  respectively

table of contents income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income taxes  topic of the fasb asc 
this statement requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when tax contingencies become probable  a liability for the contingent amount is estimated based upon the company s best estimation of the potential exposures associated with the timing and amount of deductions  as well as various tax filing positions 
as of december   the company had no reserve recorded for potential tax contingencies 
comparatively  the company had recorded reserves of  and  net of federal benefit for potential tax contingencies  for fiscal periods ended january  and january   respectively 
during fiscal  the company generated federal net operating income of million 
during fiscal and  the company generated federal net operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had a federal net operating loss nol carry forward of million available  for carry forward for the next years  through the loss generated in fiscal was carried back to offset taxable income generated in fiscal in assessing the realization of our deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets including the impact of available carry back and carry forward periods  and projected taxable income in assessing the realization of federal deferred tax assets 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
the company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its projected future performance 
consequently  based on our evaluation of all available evidence  in particular our recent operating losses  we established a federal valuation allowance of million at january  at december   the company reduced the federal valuation allowance to million  primarily due to the utilization of federal nol carry forwards  as a result of the taxable income generated in fiscal for state income tax purposes  the company had established a valuation allowance in the amount of  in fiscal  primarily to reserve for the possible non utilization of state nol carry forwards  which may not be realized in future periods before the nols expire 
the company increased the state valuation allowance at january  to  at december   the company reduced the state valuation allowance to  primarily due to the utilization of state net operating loss carry forwards in fiscal the company s state nols expire from through the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with topic of the fasb asc  which prescribes a comprehensive model of how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the provision also states that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based upon its technical merits 
the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than a likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 

table of contents the cumulative effect of this adoption did not result in any adjustment in the company s liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year reductions of tax positions for prior years reductions for tax positions for prior years due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations settlements balance at december  although the company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than the company s accrued position 
accordingly  the company s provisions on federal  state and local tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change  as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
as of december   the company does not believe that its estimates  as otherwise provided for  on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and local jurisdictions 
the company had previously reached agreement with the internal revenue service irs and closed the audit of fiscal year  with no change to the tax return 
the irs has completed their examination of the and loss years and previously received refund claims in connection with nol carry backs 
due to the size of the refunds  the results must be submitted to the joint committee on taxation jct for approval 
the irs concluded that no adjustments were necessary and jct accepted their findings in march as for state and local income taxes  with few exceptions  the company is subject to state and local income tax examinations by taxing authorities for years after stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards programs  including grants of stock options  is recorded in accordance with compensation stock compensation  topic of the fasb asc 
the grant date fair value for stock options is calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
determining the fair value of options at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise  the associated volatility and the expected dividends 
all employee stock options were granted at or above the grant date market price 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
in accordance with the stated guidance  if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
the company recognized   and  in share based compensation expense during fiscal  and  respectively
