item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our business and operations  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many important factors  including the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview kips bay medical  inc we  us  our or the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on may  we are a medical device company focused on manufacturing and commercializing our external saphenous vein support technology  or esvs mesh  for use in coronary artery bypass grafting  or cabg  surgery 
our esvs mesh is a nitinol mesh sleeve that  when placed over a saphenous vein graft during cabg surgery  is designed to improve the structural characteristics and long term performance of the saphenous vein graft 
cabg surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in the united states 
in cabg procedures  surgeons harvest blood vessels  including the internal mammary artery from the chest wall and the saphenous vein from the leg  and attach the harvested vessels to bypass  or provide blood flow around  blocked coronary arteries 
we believe the use of our esvs mesh with saphenous vein grafts in cabg surgery will improve the long term outcome of cabg procedures  including improved openness  or patency  and improved blood flow characteristics through the saphenous vein graft  resulting in a reduced need for costly and potentially complicated reoperations or revascularization procedures 
during february  we completed an initial public offering ipo of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
all shares sold in the ipo were newly issued by the company 
gross proceeds from the ipo were million 
after deducting the underwriting commissions and other expenses  we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
as additional consideration for this transaction  we issued options to purchase  shares of our common stock to the underwriters and their designees 
these options have a five year term  an exercise price of per share or of the purchase price of shares sold in the ipo  and become exercisable on february   one year after the effective date of the ipo 
in order to obtain authorization to apply the ce mark to our product and begin sales in europe  we conducted a patient multi center clinical trial outside the united states 
the goals of this trial were to demonstrate that cabg surgery using our esvs mesh was not inferior as to either safety or effectiveness as compared to traditional cabg surgery 
based on early results from this trial we received our ce mark in may in the trial  we evaluated the safety of our esvs mesh by comparing the rate of major adverse cardiac and cerebral events  or macce  days following surgery for patients treated with our esvs mesh against the same rate reported in published literature for patients with traditional cabg surgery 
we evaluated efficacy by comparing the patency of vessels treated with esvs mesh against the patency of untreated saphenous vein bypass vessels as measured by angiographic studies nine to months following implant 
the safety data from this trial has indicated that our esvs mesh and implant procedure do not result in an increase in patient complications during or for days after surgery 
however  the effectiveness data from the trial was inconclusive  primarily due to two complicating factors 
first  one of the centers participating in the trial used implant methods incompatible with our esvs mesh 
second  the amount of reduction in the diameter of the saphenous vein grafts  or downsizing  prescribed in our instructions for use and sizing tool was too aggressive  resulting in a higher than anticipated closure rate in saphenous vein grafts utilizing the esvs mesh  particularly when our smallest device  millimeters  was used 
in response to this data  we have modified our instructions for use to provide clear direction on the surgical 
table of contents method to be used with our esvs mesh  discontinued the use of our millimeter esvs mesh and reduced the amount of downsizing specified for other device sizes 
we also exclude saphenous veins with walls thicker than millimeters 
we believe these steps will resolve the patency issues identified in the trial 
we began marketing and commenced shipments of our esvs mesh in select international markets in june our esvs mesh is a novel product and we are not aware of the establishment of any specific or supplemental reimbursements for our esvs mesh 
given the budgetary pressures in europe  our sales to date have been limited 
in november we commenced enrollments in our first post market study of the esvs mesh in europe 
the intent of this study is to develop clinical data to further support the marketing and reimbursement of the esvs mesh 
the u 
s food and drug administration fda has reviewed and disapproved our most recent amendment to our application for an investigational device exemption  or ide in march at that time the fda indicated that they intended to review our ide information with outside experts before they provide further guidance to the company 
due to internal delays  the fda did not begin this review until august in september the fda advised us that we have not provided sufficient data to support our request for an ide for our esvs mesh 
in response to this  we plan to conduct a new feasibility trial in europe based upon a protocol which incorporates additional guidance requirements provided by the fda 
we began the process of identifying study sites and expect to commence enrollment in the summer of upon completion of this study  we expect to request an ide for a pivotal study in the us however  we could be delayed by adverse clinical results or regulatory complications  and we may never receive us marketing approval 
since our inception  we have generated losses 
from inception to december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we pursue the development and commercialization of our esvs mesh 
our activities from inception through the receipt of ce mark approval for our esvs mesh in may consisted principally of acquiring product and technology rights  raising capital  performing research and development and conducting preclinical and clinical trials 
subsequently  our activities included commercialization efforts in select international countries which accepted the ce mark 
successful completion of our development programs and  ultimately  our ability to generate revenues and attain profitable operations are dependent on future trends or events  including the availability of adequate reimbursement levels in each jurisdiction 
the trend toward managed healthcare in the united states and other countries and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs will significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  and could result in lower or no reimbursement for our esvs mesh 
if we are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement levels in a sufficient number of jurisdictions  our revenues and gross margins will be harmed 
the willingness of qualified distributors to agree to sell our esvs mesh in each of the markets in which we are approved 
we have identified a number of independent distributors to conduct sales in europe  and we have entered into agreements for distribution in switzerland  italy  germany  spain  belgium  the netherlands  luxembourg and the united kingdom and  subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  france 
we have also entered into an agreement with an independent distributor to conduct sales in the united arab emirates 
we may not be able to enter into additional distribution agreements on favorable terms or in a timely manner  which would harm our operating results 
our ability to negotiate satisfactory pricing with qualified distributors 
if we are unable to negotiate satisfactory pricing with qualified distributors in connection with their engagement  our revenues and gross margins will be harmed 

table of contents the pace at which we can train sales representatives of qualified distributors 
we believe we have engaged and we intend to further engage distributors that have experienced sales representatives who we expect to be able to train on the advantages and features of our esvs mesh in a timely manner 
in addition  our clinical trial experience has shown that training of physicians can occur in a short period of time  normally less than two days  but may take longer 
compliance with regulatory requirements for medical devices 
these regulatory requirements are extensive  and we believe they will continue to expand 
we expect a substantial amount of our expenses will be used for compliance with these regulatory requirements  including in connection with conducting clinical trials  regulatory submissions and ongoing compliance 
the level of acceptance of our esvs mesh in the marketplace 
if our esvs mesh is unable to achieve market acceptance  our revenues will be limited 
key components of our results of operations net sales we received ce mark approval in may and began marketing and commenced shipments of our esvs mesh in select european markets in june we sell our esvs mesh to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
the pricing in all distributor agreements is denominated in us dollars and provides for the transfer of title when we ship our esvs mesh to the distributors 
we invoice shipping charges to our distributors and include them in net sales 
we expense shipping costs at the time we report the related revenue and record them in cost of sales 
cost of sales we fabricate our esvs mesh both at our facility and at a contract manufacturer 
we conduct final assembly and packaging at our facility 
our cost of sales consists primarily of purchased components  direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead and royalties payable to medtronic  inc medtronic 
research and development expenses since our inception  we have focused our activities on the development of our esvs mesh 
we expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred 
research and development costs include the costs to design  develop  test  seek approval for  and enhance our esvs mesh and production processes 
expenses related to research and development consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  product development  preclinical and clinical trials  professional service fees  materials and supplies and facilities related costs 
we expense amounts paid to obtain patents or acquire licenses  as the ultimate recoverability of the amounts paid is uncertain 
while our research and development expenses to date have been focused on product development and evaluating the feasibility of our esvs mesh  we expect that a large percentage of our research and development expenses in the future will be incurred in support of our current and future clinical trials 
these expenditures are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and costs to complete 
as we obtain results from clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain product applications or programs in order to focus our resources on more promising product applications 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of the trial as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial  including the number of sites included in the clinical trials  
table of contents the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that participate in the clinical trials  and the duration of patient follow up 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple clinical trial sites and  in for certain trials  contract research organizations cros which administer clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones  such as number of patients enrolled 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes to the clinical trial design or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates of accrued expenses accordingly 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and other costs  including stock based compensation  for our executive and administrative personnel  legal and other professional fees  travel  sales and marketing costs  insurance and other corporate costs 
we have incurred a significant increase in selling general and administrative expenses as a result of becoming a public company in february these increases have include increased costs for insurance  costs related to quarterly  annual and other periodic filings with the sec and payments to outside consultants  lawyers and accountants 
we have also incurred significant costs to comply with the corporate governance  internal controls and similar requirements applicable to public companies 
milestone expense as consideration for the purchase of the core intellectual property relating to our esvs mesh  we have agreed to pay medtronic an aggregate of up to million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones 
the milestones and related payments consist of million due on the one year anniversary of the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh  million due when our cumulative net sales reach million and million due when our cumulative net sales reach million 
we recorded our first commercial sale in june and recorded an expense for the first milestone obligation at that time 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on investments in bank certificates of deposits  money market funds  commercial paper and corporate debt 
interest expense interest expense results primarily from interest associated with secured convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million issued to kips bay investments  llc kbi  or the notes 
our reported interest expense includes interest payable in cash based upon the stated rate in the notes and the amortization of discount recorded on the notes created by the allocation of a portion of the note proceeds to the fair value of the stock purchase options granted in conjunction with the issuance of the notes and due to the beneficial conversion feature specified in the notes 
beneficial conversion feature accounting rules require the recognition of the intrinsic value of the conversion feature at the time of the notes issuance  which is then amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the notes 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those described below 
we base our estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we sell our esvs mesh to international distributors  which subsequently resell it to hospitals and clinics 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and accounting standards codification asc s  specifically  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of goods occurs through the transfer of title and risks and rewards of ownership  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on agreements with each of our distributors  which provide that title and risk of loss pass to the distributor upon shipment of the products to the distributor and do not provide the distributors a right of return 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs  including clinical trial costs  when incurred  consistent with the guidance of asc  research and development 
all of our clinical trials are performed at clinical trial sites and certain trials are administered by contract research organizations cros 
we accrue costs for clinical trials based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites are accrued immediately 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts and the achievement of milestones  such as number of patients enrolled 
all material clinical trial and cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cros and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
stock based compensation stock based incentive awards are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires companies to measure and recognize the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
compensation cost is recognized ratably using the straight line attribution method over the expected vesting period  which is considered to be the requisite service period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating the compensation costs  instead of accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
all of our 
table of contents previously awarded options were classified as equity instruments and continue to maintain their equity classification 
the fair value of options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the assumptions described in the following sentences 
risk free interest rates are based upon us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term 
expected volatility and forfeiture rates are based on the volatility rates of a set of guideline companies  which consist of public and recently public medical technology companies 
the assumed dividend yield is zero  as we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the expected term is determined using the simplified method allowed by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering in february  the fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors at each award grant date based upon a variety of factors  primarily the most recent purchase prices of our common stock issued to third parties in arms length transactions  but also the progress of our product development  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  and the risks associated with our business plan 
if we had made different assumptions and estimates  the amount of our recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions in determining the fair market value of our common stock 
we grant options to employees and non employees  including members of our scientific advisory board 
option grants to employees have a maximum term of ten years and generally vest over four years at the rate of of the total shares underlying the option each year 
options granted to non employees have a maximum term of ten years and generally vest over three years with of the total shares underlying the option vesting on the date of grant and of the total shares vesting in each of the next three years 
option grants to non employees have been made in conjunction with and as sole consideration for their service as advisors to us 
certain of these advisors have also purchased shares of stock in our private placement offerings  but none beneficially own or more of our outstanding common stock 
the fair value of options granted to non employees is measured at each reporting date until the option  or respective portion of the option  vests and the expense recorded by us is updated accordingly 
see note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information

table of contents research and development our research and development r d expenses decreased from million in the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was driven by significant activities which were substantially completed in  including product development for our esvs mesh  the follow up from our international feasibility trial  as well as the effects of the decline in the market value of our common stock during on the value of and recorded expense for unvested stock options awarded to non employees 
these changes caused decreases of approximately   and  respectively 
these decreases were partially offset by costs associated with the initiation of our european post market studies  which began enrolling patients in november we expect that our research and development costs will increase to prior year levels now that our european post market studies have begun to enroll patients and given that we expect to begin enrollments in a european feasibility study during the summer of selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  these increases were driven primarily by an additional  of costs incurred in conjunction with becoming a public company in february in addition  we expanded our management team to support our both the requirements associated with being a public company and to support our commercial sales activity 
increased costs related to the expansion of our management team and sales marketing were approximately  and  respectively 
we expect sg a expenses to increase modestly as we continue our international sales and marketing efforts 
milestone expense our milestone expense for the year ended december  was million 
we recorded this milestone expense in conjunction with the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh and it represents the first sales milestone under our assignment and license agreement with medtronic 
under the provisions of this agreement  the payment of this milestone was due on the first anniversary of our first commercial sale of the esvs mesh  or june  and was paid at that time 
no additional milestones under the assignment and license agreement were attained in interest income interest income increased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  the increase resulted from the investment of the net proceeds from our february ipo partially offset by declines in short term interest rates from to change in fair value of investor stock purchase option the change in fair value of investor stock purchase option was a loss of million in this loss resulted from a modification to the second kips bay investments  llc kbi stock purchase option  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the option of million

we began commercial sales of our esvs mesh in june  and in conjunction with the start up of commercial manufacturing  certain costs associated with personnel and facilities previously included in r d were moved to manufacturing 
this change resulted in a further decrease in r d expenses of  these decreases were partially offset by increases in preclinical testing and stock based compensation expenses of  and  respectively 

table of contents selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in salaries and benefits and a  increase in stock based compensation costs  both related to the expansion of our management team  and a  increase in accounting and professional fees related to preparing the audited financial statements for our initial public offering 
prior to this offering  our financial statements were not audited 
sales and marketing travel and related costs were also higher by  as a result of commercialization activities we commenced after our receipt of the ce mark for our esvs mesh in may these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  related to the termination in july of a temporary consultant who performed marketing related work 
milestone expense our milestone expense for the year ended december  was million 
we recorded this milestone expense in conjunction with the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh and it represents the first sales milestone under our assignment and license agreement with medtronic 
under the provisions of this agreement  the payment of this milestone was due on the first anniversary of our first commercial sale of the esvs mesh  or june  and was paid at that time 
interest income interest income decreased from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  our interest income decreased due to the decline in rates paid on money market accounts  in which our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested  offsetting the increase in our available cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense declined from  in the year ended december  to  in the year ended december  the notes were converted into shares of common stock in february  which eliminated all debt from our balance sheet 
the year ended december  included two months of interest expense and the write off of  of unamortized discount on the notes at the time of their conversion 
change in fair value of investor stock purchase option the change in fair value of investor stock purchase option was a loss of million in the year ended december   as compared to a gain of  in the year ended december  the loss in the year ended december  resulted from a modification to the second kbi stock purchase option  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the option of million 
kbi exercised this option in february income taxes since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods prior to the current year 
the state of minnesota enacted a change to their tax code which made the minnesota research and tax credit a refundable credit for fiscal years starting on or after january  based upon our research and development costs which qualify under the minnesota tax code  we recorded an income tax benefit of and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we experience an ownership change that may occur  for example  as a result of our initial public offering of common stock in february aggregated with certain other sales of our stock before or after this offering 
if not utilized  the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before they can be used 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes our liquidity and capital resources as of december  and and for each of fiscal years ended december   and  and is intended to supplement the more detailed discussion that follows in thousands december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital year ended december  cash flow data cash provided by used in operating activities investment activities financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents our total cash resources  including short term investments  as of december  were million compared to million as of december  as of december   we had  in current liabilities and million in net working capital 
as of december   we had million in current liabilities and an  net working capital deficit 
the increase in our total cash resources and reduction in current liabilities resulted from the net proceeds of our february ipo  partially offset by cash used in operations for as we continue to pursue regulatory approvals  continue the process of commercialization in international markets  develop our manufacturing capabilities and develop additional applications for our esvs mesh  we expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses  which will continue to generate negative net cash flows from operating activities 
prior to our ipo  we had funded our operations primarily through private sales of common stock and convertible debt 
as of december   we had received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities  and net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of the notes  all of which have been converted into common stock 
in the ipo  we sold  shares of common stock receiving net proceeds of million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from our ipo  as further described in item of part ii of this annual 
table of contents report  to seek regulatory approval to market our technology in the united states which will require human clinical trials  to expand regulatory approval abroad  to develop and test additional applications of our esvs mesh  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
on october   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with aspire capital fund  llc  an illinois limited liability company aspire capital  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein  aspire capital is committed to purchase up to an aggregate of million of shares of our common stock the purchase shares over a three year period at purchase prices determined in accordance with the purchase agreement 
concurrently with entering into the purchase agreement  we also entered into a registration rights agreement with aspire capital  dated as of october   in which we agreed to file one or more registration statements as permissible and necessary to register under the securities act of  as amended  the sale by aspire capital of the shares of our common stock that have been and that may be issued to aspire capital under the purchase agreement 
we agreed to file the initial registration statement with the sec on or before november  this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  in consideration for entering into the purchase agreement  concurrently with the execution of the purchase agreement  we issued to aspire capital  shares of our common stock as a commitment fee the commitment shares 
as of the date of this report  a total of  shares of common stock  representing the commitment shares  have been issued to aspire capital pursuant to the purchase agreement  we have not yet sold any shares of common stock to aspire capital pursuant to the purchase agreement 
in the future  we may seek  or have a need  to raise additional funds through various sources  such as equity and debt financings  or through strategic collaborations and license agreements 
we cannot assure that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations  or if such funds are available to us  that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs 
we expect that the proceeds from the ipo will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next months  and we have no current intention to enter into a credit facility or loan agreement 
we do not anticipate any adverse effects stemming from the lack of available credit facilities at this time 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the net cash used in each of these periods primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  offset in part by depreciation  non cash stock based compensation  changes in the fair value of the kbi stock purchase option liability and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities 
under the provisions of the assignment and license agreement with medtronic  inc  our first milestone payment obligation of million was due and payable on the one year anniversary of the first commercial sale of our esvs mesh 
we accrued this milestone expense in june and remitted the payment in june net cash provided by used in investment activities net cash used in provided by investment activities was million in   in and  in cash used in or provided by investment activities is related to purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from our initial public offering  issuances of the notes and private sales of our common stock 

table of contents capital requirements we expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to execute our business strategy including seeking an ide approval from the fda to begin clinical trials in the united states  commercializing our esvs mesh in select european and other international markets  obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing our esvs mesh in the united states  conducting pre clinical and clinical trials to expand indications for our esvs mesh and to pursue other product development initiatives  hiring additional personnel for managerial  research and development  operations and other functions  expanding our facilities to increase our manufacturing and development capabilities  and implementing new operational  financial and management systems to comply with sec requirements 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous current and future factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our ability to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of our esvs mesh  the selling price of our esvs mesh to distributors and the price that distributors charge hospitals  the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third party payors  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our esvs mesh  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims  the cost of expanding our commercial operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  our ability to establish and maintain effective relationships with independent distributors  the rate at which physicians adopt our esvs mesh for use in cabg surgery  and the progress of preclinical and clinical trials required to support our applications for regulatory approvals  including our human clinical trials in the united states 
we expect that our existing resources as of the date of this annual report to be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next months 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to conduct additional clinical trials to obtain regulatory approvals of our esvs mesh 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  stockholders interest will be diluted  and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and harm our business 

table of contents if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to terminate  significantly modify or delay our development programs  reduce our planned commercialization efforts  or obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies to date  we have not entered into long term minimum purchase commitments with suppliers 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under the lease for our facility in minneapolis  minnesota  and certain office equipment 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations the operating lease obligation for our corporate facilities ends september  royalty payments the core intellectual property relating to our esvs mesh was sold to us by medtronic pursuant to an assignment and license agreement dated october  pursuant to the assignment and license agreement  medtronic also sold to us intellectual property relating to a brushed eptfe vascular graft  or the brushed graft product 
as consideration for the sale of intellectual property relating to the esvs mesh and the brushed graft product and other rights granted by the assignment and license agreement  we have agreed to pay medtronic an aggregate of up to million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones relating to our esvs mesh and the brushed graft product and a royalty of on sales of our esvs mesh and any future sales of the brushed graft product 
this royalty will terminate upon the earlier of the expiration of all of the patents and patent applications  or when the aggregate royalties paid reach million 
as of december   we have paid the first million milestone payment and have recorded royalty expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively
