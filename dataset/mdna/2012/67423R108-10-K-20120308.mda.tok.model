overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops  markets and sells  and are a leading provider of  proprietary topical aesthetic and therapeutic prescription strength skin care systems in the physician dispensed market 
our products are designed to prevent and improve some of the most common and visible skin disorders in adult skin  including premature aging  photodamage  skin laxity  hyperpigmentation  acne  sun damage  facial redness and soft tissue deficits  such as fine lines and wrinkles 
current products 
our primary product line is the obagi nu derm system  which we believe is the leading clinically proven  prescription based  topical skin health system on the market that has been shown to enhance the skin s overall health by correcting photodamage at the cellular level  resulting in a reduction of the visible signs of aging 
the primary active ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and otc skin care agents 
in april  we introduced the obagi c rx system consisting of a combination of prescription and otc drugs and adjunctive cosmetic skin care products to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and the oxidative damage of free radicals 
the central ingredients in this system are hydroquinone and vitamin c

in october  we launched our first product in the elastiderm product line  an eye cream for improving the elasticity and skin tone around the eyes 
we introduced the clenziderm md system and a second product in the elastiderm product line to address acne and skin elasticity around the eye  respectively  based on positive interim clinical results  in february in july  we launched our second system in the clenziderm md line  clenziderm md system ii  which is specifically formulated for normal to dry skin 
in august  we launched two new nu derm condition enhance systems 
one is designed specifically for use with non surgical procedures while the other has been developed for use with surgical procedures 
in february  we launched elastiderm d colletage  a system to treat skin conditions resulting from sun damage and improve the elasticity and skin tone for the neck and chest area 
in january  we launched obagi rosaclear  a system to treat the symptoms of rosacea

we also market tretinoin  used for the topical treatment of acne in the us  metronidazole  used for the treatment of facial rosacea in the us  and the obagi blue peel essential kit  used to aid the physician in the application of skin peeling actives 
future products 
we focus our research and new product development activities on improving the efficacy of established prescription and otc therapeutic agents by enhancing the penetration of these agents across the skin barrier using our proprietary technologies collectively known as penetrating therapeutics 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce any additional systems using these technologies 
us distribution 
we market all of our products through our direct sales force in the united states primarily to plastic surgeons  dermatologists and other physicians who are focused on aesthetic skin care 
aesthetic skin care 
as of december   we sold our products to approximately  physician dispensing accounts in the united states  with no single customer accounting for more than of our net sales 
our current products are not eligible for reimbursement from third party payors such as health insurance organizations 
we generated us net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
international distribution 
we market our products internationally through international distribution partners and beginning january   one licensing partner  all of which have sales and marketing activities in countries outside of the united states 
our distributors use a model similar to our business model in the united states  selling our products through direct sales representatives to physicians  or through alternative distribution channels depending on regulatory requirements and industry practices 
we generated international net sales of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
licensing 
we market our products in the japanese retail markets through license agreements with rohto 
under our agreements  rohto is licensed to manufacture and sell a series of otc products developed by it under the obagi brand name  as well as obagi c products  in the japanese drug store channel  and we receive a royalty based upon sales of obagi branded products in japan by rohto 
rohto s obagi branded products are sold through approximately  high end drug stores 
through december  we had other licensing arrangements in japan to market and sell otc product systems under the obagi brand  both for in office use in facial procedures  as well as for sale as a take home product kit in the spa channel 
we receive royalties based upon these arrangements 
we generated licensing revenue of million during each of the years ended december  and impairment of license 
in  we entered into a license agreement with a third party licensor to market and sell products containing a specific range of kinetin concentration in japan see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we subsequently  sublicensed these rights to an international distributer in japan 
during the three months ended march   our sublicensee discontinued the manufacture and sale of products containing the kinetin concentration 
in addition  neither we nor the sublicensee has current plans to develop or distribute products containing the kinetin concentration in the future 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million consisting of the unamortized net book value of the initial license fee and the obligation for additional payments for which there is no future benefit 
these charges were recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expense 
litigation settlement and insurance coverage 
in january  dr 
zein obagi  zo skin health  inc  and related parties filed a complaint and an arbitration demand against us 
we later filed counterclaims in both proceedings 
on may   the parties to those proceedings entered into a settlement agreement that required dismissal of all claims and counterclaims in both proceedings 
pursuant to the settlement agreement  we made a one time settlement payment of million 
the settlement agreement also contains a number of non economic terms 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the litigation and the settlement agreement 
since january through december   we incurred significant litigation and related fees  including the million settlement  of million 
during the three months ended march   we received a coverage letter from our primary general liability insurance carrier  agreeing to defend the lawsuit  under a reservation of rights 
on may   the insurance carrier filed a complaint in federal court for declaratory relief requesting an interpretation of its coverage responsibilities 
on or about july   we filed an answer and cross claim against the carrier and our previous primary general liability insurance carrier 
discovery continues and therefore  at present  we cannot estimate the amount of litigation costs and settlement fees  if any  we may recover from the insurance carrier 
effective october   we converted our payment arrangements with our legal counsel on this matter from an hourly rate to a contingency fee arrangement 
texas regulatory matter 
in november  we received a letter from the texas department of state health services regarding our shipping in texas of products containing unapproved new drugs and  specifically  referencing certain retail businesses in texas that were selling our products containing prescription drugs over the internet 
prior to this time  the agency had detained products from three of our customers that sold products on the internet as a result of a complaint received from a third party 
in its letter  the agency alleged that we were shipping unapproved new drug articles to these establishments in violation of certain texas statutes 
we submitted our response to the agency in january indicating why we believed we were in compliance with the texas statutes 
in may  the agency sent us a letter indicating that it did not agree with the arguments set forth in our january letter 
in june  we had an in person meeting with officials from the agency to further discuss its concerns 
in august  we submitted additional written information to the agency in response to the topics discussed and additional information requested by the agency at the june meeting 
from that time until april  the agency did not have any further communication with us 
in march  the agency  in response to what we then understood was a new complaint  detained our hq products from one of our customers as being unapproved new drugs and further cited this customer for dispensing prescription drugs without a pharmacy license in violation of various texas statutes 
despite repeated requests  neither the agency nor the ag has been able to identify or provide us with any additional complaints 
in early april  the agency detained products from several more of our customers citing similar violations 
shortly thereafter  we attempted to contact the agency to ascertain what the issues were that prompted the recent actions taken by the agency against these customers 
in mid april  the agency indicated to us that it had referred the matter to the ag for enforcement action 
at the end of april  we met with the agency and the ag at which time the ag stated that it viewed us to be in violation of the texas food  drug and cosmetic act and the texas deceptive trade practices act arising from the sale in texas of our hq products  which the state believes to be an unapproved new drug 
in july  the ag reiterated its position  as noted above  to us in a letter 
in july  our counsel met with the ag to continue discussions regarding an amicable settlement of this matter 
in august  the ag sent a letter following up on certain aspects of the july meeting 
by letter dated february  the agency notified the ag that it would be closing its pending investigation and enforcement action against us relating to our promotion  sales and distribution of hq products in texas effective that date and withdrew its april  referral of the matter to the ag 
the agency based its decision on i a directive that the agency set priorities for enforcement and allocate its resources and concentrate its efforts on cases that represent the greatest risk to public health and safety  ii a fda q a document issued in wherein the fda acknowledged the potential medical benefits of hydroquinone containing products for a certain medical condition  the uncertainty of the public health risks associated with the ingredient and its intent to conduct long term studies through the ntp  and iii its acknowledgment of the relevance of the fda s cpg policy statement that the fda has been using to guide its staff and industry concerning the fda s enforcement priorities for unapproved drug products 
the agency also noted that it did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an immediate risk to public health and safety from the topical use of products containing hydroquinone 
no monetary penalties or other administrative fees were levied against us as the result of the agency s investigation and no lawsuit was ever filed by the ag against us 
beginning april  we voluntarily ceased shipping any hq products into the state of texas 
in addition  we developed a plan that enabled our customers in texas to return any of these products that had not otherwise been detained in their possession in exchange for a credit or refund 
now that the investigation has been completed and the complaint withdrawn  we will evaluate the appropriate time for re introducing our hq products into texas 
our delay in resuming shipment of our hq products into the state of texas for an extended period of time could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
texas net sales  including products containing hydroquinone  represented approximately and of our total net sales during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in light of the aforementioned events  we recorded a sales returns and allowances provision for product to be returned from our customers residing in texas of million  which was recorded as a component of accrued liabilities as of march  and as an offset to net sales during the three months ended march  in addition  we recorded million in estimated finished goods inventory to be returned as of march  and as an offset to cost of sales during the three months ended march  our methodology for calculating the provision considered  by customer  the previous months of sales history 
we engaged a third party to assist in the efforts to manage the return of product from our customers residing in texas 
as a result of our efforts  during the second and third quarters of  we processed credits and refunds of million in returned or detained products 
accordingly  we adjusted the sales returns and allowances provision estimated as of march  by million  which was recorded as an increase to net sales and as a reduction to accrued liabilities during the three months ended june  as of december   we did not expect to receive any additional sales returns related to the matter 
exit of pharmacy channel 
in august  we entered the pharmacy channel for the first time by launching soluclenz rx gel  a solubilized bpo gel for the treatment of acne  which was available only by prescription 
however  after closely monitoring the progress of the launch and weekly sales data  we determined that the distribution of a single prescription product through the pharmacy channel and the ongoing investment to support that channel had become cost prohibitive 
accordingly  on april   we announced that we would no longer sell soluclenz in the pharmacy channel 
in connection with the exit of the pharmacy channel  during the year ended december   we recorded charges approximating million  related to contractual deposits  obsolete selling materials and other contract termination fees included within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  during the year ended december   we reserved approximately million in inventory included within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income 
during the quarter ended december   revenue for the remaining units dispensed during the period was fully recognized as we informed our soluclenz distributors that we were no longer going to issue credit for returned inventory 
sales 
our total net sales have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  factors contributing to our sales generation include our professional marketing efforts to physicians 
our professional sales force targets physicians who are focused on aesthetic and therapeutic skin care and educates them on how to best provide our products to their patients 
our professional sales force also provides education to physicians  aestheticians  other staff and patients about the benefits of promoting skin health 
we have increased our sales force from employees as of january  to employees as of december  we will continue to invest in expanding our sales force as warranted by the success of new product offerings and continued core product growth 
we currently do not have plans to hire a substantial number of employees in strong growth in the aesthetic skin care market 
we believe the market demand for cosmetic facial procedures reflects a growing desire and acceptance among the aging population to seek aesthetic facial products and procedures from their physicians 
with our leading position in the physician dispensed channel  the clinically proven aesthetic benefits of our products and the potential of our systems to enhance or complement many other facial procedures  we believe we are well positioned to meet this growing patient demand 
conducting clinical studies on our products 
we have completed clinical studies since to demonstrate the efficacy of our products 
we believe that these clinical studies provide our products added scientific credibility in the physician dispensed market 
we currently plan to initiate approximately additional clinical studies in international 
we have formal distribution agreements with distributors and one licensing partner and a trademark and product know how license agreement in the otc market in japan 
currently  those distributors have sales activities in approximately countries  with the most successful distributors in coming primarily from the europe  middle east and southeast asia 
results of operations 
we commenced operations in  and as of december   we had accumulated earnings of million 
we reported net income of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
seasonality 
sales of our products have historically been higher between september and march 
we believe this is due to increased product use and patient compliance during these months 
we believe this increased usage and compliance relates to several factors such as higher patient tendencies toward daily compliance inversely proportionate to their tendency to travel and or engage in other disruptive activities during summer months 
patient travel and other disruptive activities that affect compliance are at their peak during july and august 
the effects of seasonality in the past have been offset by the launch of new products 
this trend was very pronounced during when we launched four new product offerings and rebranded two systems 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to offset such seasonality in the future 
economy 
many treatments in which our products are used are considered cosmetic in nature  are typically paid for by the patient out of disposable income and are generally not subject to reimbursement by third party payors such as health insurance organizations 
as a result  we believe that our current and future sales growth may be influenced by the economic conditions within the geographic markets in which we sell our products 
although there are modest signs of economic recovery  it is unclear whether the economy will show sustained growth and or stability 
even with continued growth in many of our markets  the recent recession could adversely impact our business in the future causing a decline in demand for our products  particularly if uncertain economic conditions are prolonged or worsen 
we do believe that some of the negative impact experienced during the majority of was partially offset due to the following i we are the leader in the physician dispensed market  ii the aesthetic nature of our products  iii the lower price point of our products compared to other aesthetic products in our market  iv the desire to maintain a healthy and youthful appearance  and v the demographics of the patients who use our products 
future growth 
we believe that our future growth will be driven by increased direct sales coverage  penetration into non core markets such as other medical specialties  ongoing marketing efforts to create increased awareness of the obagi brand and the benefits of skin health and new product offerings 
although we have in recent history moderated our investments in our strategic initiatives as a result of the recent recession and uncertain economic conditions  we plan to increase our investment in initiatives that we believe will facilitate growth in the business 
beginning in  we plan to invest significant capital and other resources into the creation and maintenance of an e commerce platform that we currently believe will expand our base of end users 
however  we cannot assure you that the e commerce platform will result in the expected growth of our business 
in addition  as opportunities present themselves  we plan to look towards the commercialization of new applications of our current products  the continuing development of our pipeline of products and the in licensing or acquisition of new product opportunities 
such future investments could involve significant resources to facilitate more rapid growth 
at present  we believe that our ongoing profitability is primarily dependent upon the continued success of our current product offerings and certain other strategic marketing initiatives 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  sales and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
by their nature  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  it is possible that our actual results will differ significantly from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues for our physician dispensed segment in accordance with asc  revenue recognition asc  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
asc outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for disclosure related to revenue recognition policies 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price charged is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our shipment terms are fob shipping point as outlined in our sales agreements 
our domestic sales agreements do not provide for rights of return or price protection 
however  we may approve returns on a case by case basis at our discretion 
certain international distribution agreements do provide for rights of return and price protection 
generally  such return rights are for a period of not more than days after the products have been shipped to the distributors 
in accordance with asc  revenue recognition products asc  we continuously monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
we do not grant any warranty provisions on our products 
we provide for discounts and allowances based on historical experience at the time revenue is recognized as a reduction to revenue 
to date  such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
other than our allowance for sales returns  the only estimates that we have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectability of the resulting receivable  both of which are discussed below 
we grant price protection rights to certain international distributors 
such price protection rights require us to pay the distributor if there is a reduction in the list price of our products 
price protection payments would be required for the distributor s inventory on hand or in transit on the date of the price reduction  for a period not to exceed days prior to the date of the price reduction 
we have not recorded a liability in connection with such price protection rights as we have never reduced the list prices of our products 
in september  we entered into a licensing agreement  as amended in december  with rohto see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a large japan based company that specializes in the distribution and marketing of otc medical oriented products in the drug store and retail channels 
in january  we entered into a three year licensing agreement  renewable by mutual agreement for additional one year periods  with tokyo beauty center  a diversified japanese consumer products and services company  which also owns and operates a large chain of aesthetic spas in japan 
in january  we did not exercise the option to renew this licensing arrangement 
royalty revenue is recognized as earned and is based upon a predetermined rate within the respective licensing agreement 
as noted earlier  during the year ended december   we entered the pharmacy channel for the first time by launching soluclenz rx gel  which was available only by prescription 
we sold soluclenz to pharmaceutical wholesalers  who had the right to return purchased product prior to the units being dispensed through patient prescriptions 
on april   we announced that we would no longer sell soluclenz in the pharmacy channel 
revenue for this product was recognized in accordance with asc among its criteria for revenue recognition from sale transactions where a buyer has a right of return  asc requires the amount of future returns to be reasonably estimated 
as substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership did not transfer upon shipment  we treated the sale of product under a consignment model 
under this consignment model  we did not recognize revenue upon the shipment of product with the guaranteed sale provision and accounted for inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory 
due to our limited experience in the pharmacy channel  we were unable to reasonably estimate customer returns and  therefore  only recognized revenue related to soluclenz units once the units had been dispensed through patient prescriptions because units dispensed to patients were not subject to return 
we obtained actual prescription units dispensed based on distribution channel data provided by external  independent sources 
in connection with our exit from the pharmacy channel  during the year ended december   revenue for the remaining units dispensed during the period was fully recognized as we informed our soluclenz distributors that we were no longer going to issue credit for returned inventory 
sales returns and allowances 
when we sell our products  we reduce the amount of revenue recognized from such sales by an estimate of future product returns and other sales allowances 
sales allowances include cash discounts  rebates and sales incentives relating to products sold in the current period 
factors that are considered in our estimates of sales returns include the historical rate of returns as a percentage of net product sales  excluding returns and allowances and shipping and handling revenue  historical aging of returns and the current market conditions 
although our domestic sales agreements do not provide for a contractual right of return  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period after shipment of the product has occurred 
factors that are considered in our estimates regarding sales allowances include quality of product and recent promotional activity 
as discussed earlier  in april  we were made aware of enforcement actions taken against certain of our customers by the agency and the ag regarding the shipping of our hq products  into the state of texas 
as a result of these actions  we have voluntarily ceased shipping any hq products in the state of texas 
we developed a plan that enabled our customers residing in texas to return any of these products that had not otherwise been detained in their possession in exchange for credit or refund 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a sales returns and allowances provision related to this matter of million as a component of accrued liabilities and as an offset to net sales 
in addition  we recorded million in estimated finished goods inventory to be returned as of march  and as an offset to cost of sales during the three months ended march  our methodology for calculating the provision considered  by customer  the previous months of sales history 
during the second and third quarters of  we processed credits and refunds of million for returned or detained products related to the texas matter 
as of december   we did not anticipate further sales returns related to the matter 
if actual future experience for product returns and other sales allowances exceeds the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
to date  such provisions have approximated management s estimates 
accounts receivable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
receivables are generally due within days 
however  the recent recession and ongoing tightening of credit in financial markets has  in some cases  adversely impacted our customers cash flow and ability to access sufficient credit in a timely manner  which  in turn  has impacted their ability to make timely payments to us 
in light of these circumstances  and in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  for certain selected customers who we deemed to be creditworthy based upon their prior payment history  we extended our standard payment terms to net days for selected product purchases made in connection with specific sales promotion programs 
such extension did not represent a permanent change to the payment terms for such customers but  rather  was applicable only to those specified purchases made by such customers in connection with the related sales promotion 
we deem a receivable to be past due when it has not been paid in accordance with the terms of the applicable invoice eg  net days or net days prepared at the time of sale 
accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts   or million  and  or million  were deemed current as of december  and  respectively 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical write offs as a percentage of product sales  adjusted specifically for accounts that are past due  non performing  in bankruptcy or otherwise identified as at risk for potential credit loss 
receivables are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is deemed to be uncollectible  taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer and the value of any collateral 
as of december  we decreased our allowance for doubtful accounts to million  from million at december  the decrease was primarily related to a non performing international distributor that we reserved for during the year ended december  and subsequently wrote off during the year ended december  see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we have seen an improvement in our days sales outstanding dso  due to our collection efforts  from days as of december  to days as of december  on an annual basis  customers with significant purchases are reviewed for their creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments and if the uncollectible balances exceed our estimates as of the balance sheet date  we would need to charge additional receivables to our allowances  and our financial position  results of operation and cash flow would be negatively impacted 
our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed at standard cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology  new product offerings and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
to date  actual reserve requirements have approximated management s estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted authoritative guidance issued by the fasb  which requires  among other things  the use of a nonamortization approach for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a nonamortization approach  goodwill and intangibles having an indefinite life are not amortized  but instead will be reviewed for impairment at least annually or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
events or circumstances that could indicate impairment include a significant change in the business climate  economic and industry trends  legal factors  negative operating performance indicators  significant competition  changes in our strategy or disposition of a reporting unit or a portion thereof 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance in asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test that adds a qualitative assessment which allows companies to determine whether they need to perform the two step impairment test 
we elected to adopt this accounting guidance early at the beginning of our third quarter of on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests 
the guidance under asc gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that is more than likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the guidance requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is not required to perform the two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to such reporting units  assignment of goodwill to such reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we have selected september as the date on which we perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
we attribute the entire balance of our goodwill of million to our largest operating segment  which is also a reporting unit  the physician dispensed segment 
we first performed the qualitative assessment to determine the need  if any  to perform the two step impairment test  due to the following i the historical significant excess of the fair value of our physician dispensed reporting unit over its carrying value  ii our history of no impairment charges related to goodwill  iii our continued growth and the positive operating results of our physician dispensed business  iv our brand recognition  and v our position as the market leader in the physician dispensed channel 
our qualitative assessment of our physician dispensed segment as of september  considered our current and projected operating results  our continued growth in spite of a slow growth economy  current and future expected economic  market  and competitive conditions  and our current strategic initiatives 
based on our qualitative assessment  we determined that the fair value of our physician dispensed segment continued to exceed the carrying amount of our goodwill by a significant margin 
as a result  we did not conduct the two step impairment test on our goodwill balance 
there were no impairment triggers subsequent to september  through the date of this annual report on form k 
based on our analyses  no goodwill impairment charges were recognized for the years ended december   and other intangible assets consist of trademarks  distribution rights  covenants not to compete  patents  customer lists  licenses and proprietary formulations 
other intangible assets are amortized over the expected period of benefit using the straight line method over the following lives trademarks years  distribution rights ten years  covenants not to compete seven years  and other intangible assets three to years 
in accordance with asc  long lived assets including intangible assets that are amortized are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  such as a significant sustained change in the business climate  during the interim periods 
if an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of assets  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is compared to the asset group s carrying value 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
in april  the sublicensee of our non exclusive right to market and sell any and all products marked under the obagi brand containing a specific range of kinetin concentration in japan  ceased the manufacture and distribution of products containing the kinetin concentration in february as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended march  related to the license 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition  during the year ended december   we wrote off million in patents that were abandoned 
there were no other indicators of impairment noted during  therefore no other tests were performed for long lived assets 
any unfavorable changes in market conditions or our product lines may result in the impairment of goodwill or an intangible asset  which could adversely impact our net income 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance under asc  compensation asc 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the date of grant using any valuation model requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
we estimated our options expected terms in accordance with asc  using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding 
if we determine that another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term yields a more accurate estimate than our current methods  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated for stock based awards could change significantly 
higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to stock based compensation determined at the date of grant 
the expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
uncertainty in income taxes 
the provisions under asc prescribe a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions meeting the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of this interpretation 
the provisions also provide guidance on accounting for derecognition  interest and penalties  and classification and disclosure of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes 
as of december   the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was million 
results of operations the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the years ended december  and year ended december  change in thousands net sales by product category physician dispensed nu derm vitamin c elasticity therapeutic other total licensing fees total net sales united states international net sales increased by million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  overall  we believe our net sales growth during the year ended december  was primarily due to the launch of new products  a larger base of active accounts and international physician dispensed growth 
however  we believe this growth was offset by the texas regulatory matter see overview above for further discussion 
physician dispensed sales increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  we experienced net increases in the following product categories i an increase in the other category of million  ii a million increase in nu derm sales  and iii an increase in vitamin c of million 
the growth in the other category was primarily attributable to the launch of blue peel radiance in january  which contributed million  partially offset by million in sales returns related to texas 
the growth in our nu derm sales was primarily due to the launch of nu derm sun shield spf in january  which contributed million  partially offset by million in sales returns related to texas 
these product category increases were partially offset by i a decrease of million in the therapeutic category  and ii a decrease of million in elasticity sales 
the decline in the therapeutic category was primarily due to a decline in sales of our clenziderm product line 
licensing fees remained fairly flat at million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our aggregate sales growth was composed of million in the us  and a million increase from our international markets 
the increase in international sales was primarily due to increases in the vitamin c and other product categories and was principally a result of i a million increase in the far east region  ii a million increase from the europe and other regions  iii a million increase in the middle east  and iv a million increase from the americas 
as previously discussed  as a result of the actions brought by the texas state regulatory bodies in april  we have ceased selling any hq products into the state of texas 
despite the growth we have experienced during and  we believe that until we can resume shipping hq products into texas and see continued stabilization in the global economy  our future net sales could be negatively impacted 
gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage remained fairly flat at during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the gross margin for our physician dispensed segment slightly declined to as compared to for last year 
the decline in our physician dispensed segment was primarily a result of an increase in our inventory reserve for expired product and for inventory returned related to the texas regulatory matter  partially offset by a change in sales mix among products  favoring our higher margin products during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our gross margin for our licensing segment increased slightly to compared to for last year 
the increase in our licensing segment gross margin is due to a decline in license amortization expense and royalties expense related to products containing a specific kinetin concentration  during the year ended december  see impairment of license discussion under overview  as compared to the prior year 
cost of sales also includes outbound shipping and handling  work order scrap  licensing and royalty fees related to licensed intellectual property  depreciation and amortization attributable to products sold  and an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  professional fees  insurance costs  stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization not attributable to products sold  warehousing costs  marketing costs  travel expenses  general and administrative support expenses and other selling expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following i a million increase in costs associated with the litigation and settlement of matters related to dr 
obagi see notes and to our consolidated financial statements  ii a million increase in professional fees primarily related to consultants for our operations group and towards the evaluation of strategic alternatives to grow the business  iii million in expenses related to the texas regulatory matter  which includes costs for coordinating the return of product from our customers residing in texas  as well as legal and other related costs  iv a million increase in other marketing principally due to increased efforts in market research and consumer engagement initiatives  v a million increase in promotions and training expenses  vi million in impairment charges see note to our consolidated financial statements  vii a million increase in non cash compensation  and viii a million increase in other expenses 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in headcount related expenses primarily due to a decrease in commissions and bonus  ii a million decrease in bad debt expense  due to the provision on a non performing international distributor of million during the year ended december   and due to an improvement in collections  reducing the number of accounts written off  iii a million decrease in expenses related to the secondary offering completed in november  iv a million decrease in rent expense due to the termination of the agreement with dr 
obagi in september  and v a million decrease in depreciation and amortization 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  increased to as compared to for the year ended december  we anticipate operating costs to increase  due to our investment in certain strategic initiatives during fiscal year research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to i a million decrease in expenses related to the development of line extensions and reformulations of existing products  ii a million decrease in accelerated advisory and related fees pursuant to the termination of the agreement with dr 
obagi in september  and iii a million decrease in expenses related to the development of new products 
the decline in our research and development costs is primarily due to the timing of our research and development activities and we have not reduced  nor do we intend to reduce  our long term emphasis on research and development 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
interest income declined to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  we earn interest income from the investment of our cash balance into higher interest yielding certificates of deposit 
the decline is due to a decline in our average cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and a decline in our weighted average interest rate from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  interest expense increased to  during the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  interest expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees related to our credit and term loan agreement 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the difference is primarily due to the impact of the research and development credit and a decrease in our state tax expense as a result of the adoption for california purposes of single sales factor apportionment 
in addition certain costs incurred during the secondary offering and stock repurchase completed in november were not deductible for tax purposes during the year ended december  the year ended december  compared the year ended december  net sales 
the following table compares net sales by product line and certain selected products for the years ended december  and year ended december  change in thousands net sales by product category physician dispensed nu derm vitamin c elasticity therapeutic other total licensing fees total net sales united states international net sales increased by million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  overall  we believe our growth during the year ended december  is primarily due to a larger base of active accounts  higher level of patient visits due to increased consumer confidence versus last year  the launch of new products and the average price increase of on our products implemented on january physician dispensed sales increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million during the year ended december  we experienced an increase in the majority of our product categories as follows i an increase in vitamin c of million  of which million was attributable to our normal to oily line extension of obagi c rx launched in january  ii an increase in nu derm sales of million  iii a million increase in elasticity sales  of which million was attributable to the launch of our elastilash product in october  and iv an increase in the other category of million 
the growth in the other category was primarily attributable to the launch of refissa in september  which accounted for million of the increase 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the therapeutic category 
the decline in the therapeutic category was primarily attributable to the increased promotional activity surrounding the launch of our rosaclear product in january and our exit of the pharmacy channel in april licensing fees decreased by million due to a decline in unit sales by our japanese partner rohto during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our aggregate sales growth was composed of million in the us  partially offset by a million decrease from our international markets and a decline in licensing fees of million 
the decline in international sales was primarily due to declines in the therapeutic and other product categories and was principally a result of a million decrease in the far east region  partially offset by i a million increase in the middle east  ii a million increase from the americas  and iii a million increase from the europe and other regions 
gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage increased slightly to for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the overall increase is primarily attributable to an increase in gross margin for our physician dispensed segment  which increased to compared to for the same period last year 
the improvement was primarily a result of i an increase in sales volumes primarily in our nu derm and vitamin c product categories  ii an average price increase of on our products implemented on january   and a iii a decrease in sales volumes in our therapeutic products  which have a lower margin than most of our other product categories  partially offset by a million increase in product costs  largely in our other product category 
our gross margin for our licensing segment increased slightly to compared to for the same period last year 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million during the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the following i million in expenses for matters related to dr 
obagi  including expenses related to pending litigation of approximately million and million related to the termination of the agreement dated as of june  agreement  in september  which includes the write off of prepaid rent and leasehold improvements at a beverly hills location leased by us  ii a million increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in sales commissions  accrued bonus and an increase in marketing and sales force headcount  iii million in severance and other related charges in connection with the departure of steven r 
carlson  our former president and chief executive officer  in october  iv a million increase in other marketing expenses primarily due to the launch of elastilash in october  v a million increase in promotions and training expenses  vi million in expenses related to our secondary offering completed in november  vii a million increase in expenses related to our third party logistics provider  viii a million increase in other expenses  million of which was due to losses on disposal of fixed assets  ix a million increase in volume driven expenses  x a million increase in product development expenses  and xi a million increase in other expenses  primarily due to a loss on dissolution of foreign subsidiary 
these increases were partially offset by i a million decrease in soluclenz related expenses as a result of our exit from the pharmacy channel  of which million was due to the distribution and support of the product in the pharmacy channel and million was due to the write off of nonrefundable deposits and the accrual of other contract termination costs  ii a million decrease in professional fees  iii a million decrease in depreciation and amortization  iv a million decrease in non cash compensation  v a million decrease in expenses driven by being a public company  and vi a million decrease in rent expense 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  increased to as compared to for the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  during we recorded million in accelerated advisory and related fees pursuant to the termination of the agreement with dr 
obagi 
in addition  salaries and related expenses increased million 
these increases were offset by i a million decrease in expenses related to the development of line extensions and reformulations of existing products  ii a million decrease in expenses related to the development of new products  and iii million in grant funds received under the qualifying therapeutic discovery grant program administered by the internal revenue service and the department of health and human services in support of the company s development of nu derm for the treatment of melasma  which were recorded as an offset to research and development expense 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development costs in the year ended december  were as compared to in the year ended december  interest income and interest expense 
interest income declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we earn interest income from the investment of our cash balance into higher interest yielding certificates of deposit 
although our average cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   our weighted average interest rate decreased from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  interest expense remained fairly flat at million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  interest expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and commitment fees related to our credit and term loan agreement 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased million to million for year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  although our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   the decline in expense is due to a decline in income before provision for income taxes of million 
as in the prior year  the effective tax rate includes the tax benefit derived from the research and development credit during the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to certain costs incurred during the secondary offering and stock repurchase completed in november not being deductible for tax purposes during the year ended december liquidity and capital resources trends and uncertainties affecting liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our cash generated by operations and availability under our credit and term loan agreement 
as of december  we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under the facility and term loans 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash generated by operations  together with our available credit capacity  will enable us to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements 
the following has or is expected to impact liquidity in october  we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock  depending on market conditions and other factors 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million of our outstanding common stock 
no repurchases were effected during the year ended december   leaving us with million available for repurchases under the program 
on march   our board authorized a million increase to our stock repurchase program  resulting in the availability to repurchase up to million of our common stock as of such date 
during the year ended december   we purchased million of our outstanding stock pursuant to a repurchase plan approved by our board of directors in august to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock  which expired in august  the legal costs and related settlement expense related to the litigation and arbitration involving us and dr 
obagi were material 
although our primary insurance carrier has agreed to defend the lawsuit  under a reservation of rights  we cannot estimate the amount  if any that the insurance carrier will agree to pay 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  during the year ended december   we recorded million in sales returns for products returned from customers residing in the state of texas 
we voluntarily ceased shipment of certain of our products containing hydroquinone into the state of texas 
our delay in resuming shipment of our hq products into the state of texas for an extended period of time could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
texas net sales  including products containing hydroquinone  represented approximately and of our total net sales during the year ended december  and  respectively  although no enforcement action has been instituted against us for the california regulatory matter to date  it is possible that we will incur significant legal costs and potential penalties may be assessed see item b of part ii of this report 
if the ultimate expenses  penalties and or restrictions are material  this matter could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  many of our products are manufactured by a single source 
in the event that any of our single source manufacturers experiences a disruption in supply  our product supply  sales operations and or our ability to collect any outstanding receivable could be adversely affected 
during  this occurred with one such manufacturer 
as of december   amounts due from this manufacturer were approximately million 
if this or any other of our single source manufacturers experiences a significant disruption in supply it could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows  and we plan to invest significant capital and other resources in of between million and million into the creation and maintenance of an e commerce platform and fulfillment center 
we cannot assure you that the e commerce platform will result in the growth of our business 
investment into this initiative could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are operating in an uncertain and volatile economic environment  which could have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
the pharmaceutical industry has been impacted by the volatility in the financial markets  including declines in stock prices  and by uncertain economic conditions 
increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the availability of consumer credit and housing markets  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses to consumer retirement and investment accounts  and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have all added to declines in consumer confidence and curtailed consumer spending 
the recent recession and ongoing tightening of credit in financial markets has  in some cases  adversely impacted our customers cash flow and ability to access sufficient credit in a timely manner  which  in turn  has impacted their ability to make timely payments to us 
in light of these circumstances  and in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  for certain selected customers who we deemed to be creditworthy based upon their prior payment history  we extended our standard payment terms from net days to net days for selected product purchases made in connection with certain sales promotion programs 
such extension does not represent a permanent change to the payment terms for such customers but  rather  was applicable only to specified purchases made by such customers in connection with the applicable sales promotion program 
sales of products having net day payment terms represented of our net sales for the year ended december  although we have extended our credit terms for certain purchases made by certain qualified customers  we have seen improvement in our dso from days as of december  to days as of december  it is unclear how long the current economic environment will continue  whether there will be new events that could contribute to additional deterioration  and if so  what effect such events could have on our business in as noted above  to facilitate more rapid growth  we plan to invest in a new e commerce platform and fulfillment center and  as the opportunities arise  the commercialization of new application of our current products  the continuing development of our pipeline of products and the in licensing or acquisition of new product opportunities 
while we plan to increase our investments in these initiatives  we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow through our operations 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility or term loans 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants under the credit and term loan agreement as of december  we expect to be in compliance with both our non financial and financial covenants during  however  economic conditions or the occurrence of any of the significant events discussed above under risk factors could cause noncompliance with our financial covenants 
we expect to be able to manage our working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  in working capital 
we invested approximately million in capital expenditures during the year ended december   which largely consisted of software and it upgrades 
in  we expect to spend approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily related to an e commerce platform and fulfillment center  and software and it upgrades 
cash requirements for our business historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements and through private and public sales of common stock 
we currently invest our cash and cash equivalents in large money market funds 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of cash and cash equivalents 
on may   we entered into an amendment the amendment to the credit and term loan agreement  dated as of november  the original agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the original agreement  we have access to i up to million in a revolving credit facility  and ii one or more term loans in an aggregate amount of up to million 
under the terms of the original agreement  we were entitled to borrow under the term loans until the earliest to occur of i the date the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans equaled million  ii may   or iii the date we requested to close out the term loans 
the amendment  among other things  extends the eligible draw period of the term loans for a year  so that we may now borrow under them until the earliest to occur of i the date the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans equals million  ii may   or iii the date we request to close out the term loans 
the facility will terminate  and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due on july  and all amounts outstanding under the term loans will be due five years after the last day we request to close out the term loans  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of the credit and term loan agreement 
as of the date of the amendment  we had no outstanding balance on the facility or the term loans 
any borrowings under the credit and term loan agreement will bear variable interest based on a margin  at our option  over prime rate or libor as defined in the credit and term loan agreement 
all amounts borrowed under the credit and term loan agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of our tangible and intangible assets 
the credit and term loan agreement contains certain financial and non financial covenants 
non financial covenants include  among other things  monthly and quarterly reporting of a listing of our intellectual property 
financial covenants include requirements for maintaining i a minimum quick ratio  ii a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible effective net worth  and iii a minimum adjusted ebitda amount  as well as limitations on a annual capital expenditures  b asset or equity based investments  c stock repurchases  which may not exceed million  d dividend distributions  which may not exceed of net income for the preceding fiscal year  and e joint venture investments  which may not exceed million 
see below for covenant compliance as of requirement facility covenants minimum quick ratio maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible effective net worth minimum adjusted ebitda million million maximum stock repurchase million million maximum dividend distribution million maximum capital expenditures million million as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the facility or term loans 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants under the credit and term loan agreement  as amended  as of december  in march  we received a commitment from comerica bank  to i extend the facility maturity date from july  to july   unless otherwise terminated in accordance with the credit and term loan agreement  ii extend the draw period of our term loans from may  to earliest to occur of a the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the term loans equaling the term commitment  b july   and c our written request to commence the terming out of the term loans  iii increase the maximum stock repurchases we may effect from million to million  iv allow intercompany loans or intercompany investments in our subsidiary created for the e commerce initiative in an aggregate not to exceed million  and v exempt our subsidiary related to the e commerce initiative from the subsidiary requirements of the credit and term loan agreement 
we intend to enter into an amendment to our credit and term loan agreement with comerica bank to reflect these changes by the end of march on october   we announced that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock  depending on market conditions and other factors 
share repurchases could include the repurchase of shares from the selling stockholders in connection with the secondary offering completed in november  as well as repurchases made through open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with sec rule b  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
during the fourth quarter ended december   we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock for a cost of million 
no repurchases were effected during the year ended december   leaving us with million available for repurchases under the program 
on march   our board authorized a million increase to our stock repurchase program  resulting in the availability to repurchase up to million of our common stock as of such date 
this authorization does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock nor does it ensure that any shares will be repurchased  and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
we continually evaluate new opportunities for products or therapeutic systems and  if and when appropriate  intend to pursue such opportunities through the acquisitions of companies  products or technologies and our own development activities 
our ability to execute on such opportunities in some circumstances may be dependent  in part  upon our ability to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms 
there can be no assurance that funds from these sources will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution or such equity securities may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states and were denominated in japanese yen 
none of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
cash flow year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the primary sources of cash were million in net income  including the effect of i adjusting for non cash items  ii an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities through timing of payments for operational  promotional and inventory purchases  iii a decrease in accounts receivable through improvement in our dso from days to days  iv a decrease in income taxes receivable  and v a decrease in inventory through an increase in our inventory turn ratio from to net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  this was due to costs associated with software and it upgrades and investments in licenses and patent related intellectual property during the year ended december  we anticipate spending approximately million for total capital expenditures in primarily for planned investments in an e commerce platform and fulfillment center  and software and it upgrades

the new guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity and requires an entity to present either one continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive income or two separate  but consecutive  statements 
further  the guidance requires reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income to be presented on the face of the financial statements 
however  in december  the fasb issued follow up guidance to defer the requirement to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements and allow entities to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
we will adopt this new guidance beginning the first quarter of the fiscal year ending december   and will apply it retrospectively 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance in asc  with respect to the annual goodwill impairment test that adds a qualitative assessment allowing companies to determine whether they need to perform the two step impairment test 
the objective of the guidance is to simplify how companies test goodwill for impairment  and more specifically to reduce the cost and complexity of performing the goodwill impairment test 
the guidance may change how the goodwill impairment test is performed  but should not change the timing or the measurement of goodwill impairments 
we elected to adopt this accounting guidance early at the beginning of our third quarter of on a prospective basis for goodwill impairment tests 
the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in large money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturity dates no greater than one year 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
although substantially all of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the us we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us prime rate and libor interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us libor interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents 
if the interest rates on our cash and cash equivalents were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest income would increase or decrease by approximately million 
other risks the recent recession has had an adverse impact on the financial services industry  including insurance companies  some of whom provide insurance coverage to us 
to the extent we have any claims in the future and such insurance providers are unable  due to their financial condition  to pay covered claims  we could experience adverse impacts on our cash flow and cash reserves 
we have no way of knowing whether or not any insurance providers that are financially stable at this time will experience financial difficulties in the future that could impact their ability to pay covered claims
