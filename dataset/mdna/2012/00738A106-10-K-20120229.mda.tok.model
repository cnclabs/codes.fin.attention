item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  manufactures and markets solutions and provides services and support for communications networks 
our solutions are widely deployed by providers of communications services serviced by our carrier networks division  and small and mid sized enterprises smes serviced by our enterprise networks division  and enable voice  data  video and internet communications across wireline and wireless networks 
many of these solutions are currently in use by every major united states and many global service providers  as well as by many public  private and governmental organizations worldwide 
our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of our strategy is to reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price based on the cost savings achieved in order to gain market share and or improve gross margins 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
our three major product categories are carrier systems  business networking and loop access 
carrier systems products are used by communications service providers to provide data  voice and video services to consumers and enterprises 
the carrier systems category includes our broadband access products comprised of total access multi service access and aggregation platform products  total access series fiber to the node fttn products  ultra broadband ethernet ube and digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam products 
our broadband access products are used by service providers to deliver high speed internet access  voice over internet protocol voip  ip television iptv  and or ethernet services from the central office or remote terminal locations to customer premises 
the carrier systems category also includes our optical access products 
these products consist of optical access multiplexers and transceivers including those used in our optical networking edge one products  netvanta series products  and our family of opti products 
optical access products are used to deliver higher bandwidth services  aggregate large numbers of low bandwidth services  or transport wavelength services across a fiber optic infrastructure 
total access products  concentrator products  m multiplexer products  and a number of mobile backhaul products are also included in the carrier systems product category 
business networking products provide access to telecommunication services  facilitating the delivery of converged services and unified communications to the small and mid sized enterprises sme market 
the business networking category includes internetworking products and integrated access devices iads 
internetworking products consist of our total access ip business gateways  optical network terminals onts  virtual wireless lan products and netvanta product lines 
netvanta products include multi service routers  managed ethernet switches  ip private branch exchange pbx products  ip phone products  unified communications solutions  unified threat management utm solutions  and carrier ethernet network terminating equipment nte 
iad products consist of our total access series and the total access loop access products are used by carrier and enterprise customers for access to copper based telecommunications networks 
the loop access category includes products such as digital data service dds and integrated services digital network total reach products  high bit rate digital subscriber line hdsl products including total access hdsl and time division multiplexed symmetrical hdsl tdm shdsl products  t e t  channel service units data service units  and tracer fixed wireless products 
in addition  we identify subcategories of product revenues  which we divide into our core products and legacy products 
our core products consist of broadband access and optical access products included in carrier systems and internetworking products included in business networking and our legacy products include hdsl products included in loop access and other products not included in the aforementioned core products 
many of our customers are migrating their networks to deliver higher bandwidth services by utilizing newer technologies 
we believe that products and services offered in our core product areas position us well for this migration 
despite occasional increases  we anticipate that revenues of many of our legacy products  including hdsl  will decline over time  however  revenues from these products may continue for years because of the time required for our customers to transition to newer technologies 

table of contents sales were million in compared to million in and million in sales increased in each of our core areas  broadband access  optical access and internetworking 
total sales of products in these three core areas increased in compared to and in compared to our gross profit margin for the company decreased to in from in and our operating income margin increased to in compared to in and in net income was million in compared to million in and million in earnings per share  assuming dilution  were in compared to in and in earnings per share in  and include the effect of the repurchase of million  million and million shares of our stock in those years  respectively 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors  including customer order activity and backlog 
backlog levels vary because of seasonal trends  the timing of customer projects and other factors that affect customer order lead times 
many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including a decline in general economic and market conditions  increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product and services mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  expediting costs and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
additionally  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
also  not maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products may cause us to incur expediting costs to meet customer delivery requirements  which may negatively impact our operating results in a given quarter 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
for a discussion of risks associated with our operating results  see item a of this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any rebates or discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed or determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the terms of each respective contract where applicable  or under our standard shipping terms for purchase orders accepted without a contract  generally fob shipping point 
in the case of consigned inventory  revenue is recognized when the customer assumes ownership of the product 
contracts that contain multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the units of accounting  and the revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each item requiring separate revenue recognition based on the relative selling price and corresponding terms of the contract 
we strive to use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price 
when this evidence is not available  we are generally not able to determine third party evidence of selling price because of the extent of customization among competing products or services from other companies 
we record revenue associated with installation services when all contractual obligations are complete 
contracts that include both installation services and product sales are evaluated for revenue recognition in accordance with contract terms 
as a result  depending on contract terms  installation services may be considered as a separate deliverable item or may be considered an element of the delivered product 
either the purchaser  adtran  or a third party can perform installation of our products 
revenues related to maintenance services are recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
a significant portion of enterprise networks products are sold in the united states through a non exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors 
these organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value 
table of contents added resellers and system integrators 
value added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel partner  or they may purchase from the distributor on an unaffiliated basis 
additionally  with certain limitations  our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock balancing purposes when these returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
prior to issuing payment terms to a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits and payment terms are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was thousand at december  and million at december  we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on at least a quarterly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period  therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while achieving market returns 
the objective of our long term investment policy is principal preservation and total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
these objectives are achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income securities  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
our investment policy provides limitations for issuer concentration  which limits  at the time of purchase  the concentration in any one issuer to of the market value of our total investment portfolio 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility 
in accordance with the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the fasb asc  we have categorized our cash equivalents held in money market funds and our investments held at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique for the cash equivalents and investments as follows level values based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market  level values based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  level values based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs include information supplied by investees 
at december   we categorized million and million of our available for sale investments as level and level  respectively  and million of our cash equivalents as level at december   we categorized million and million of our available for sale investments as level and level  respectively  and million of our cash equivalents as level 
table of contents we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical declines in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a fair value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by or more for six or more consecutive months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
as a result of our review  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of thousand during the fourth quarter of for the years ended december   and  we recorded charges of thousand  thousand and million  respectively  related to the other than temporary impairment of certain publicly traded equity securities  a fixed income bond fund  and deferred compensation plan assets 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this report for more information about our investments 
we also invest in privately held entities and private equity funds and record these investments at cost 
we review these investments periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
we have not been required to record any impairment losses relating to these investments in  or for purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our stock option awards on the date of grant under the stock compensation topic of the fasb asc  we use the black scholes model 
this model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
because our stock option awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing model may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock option awards 
for purposes of determining the estimated fair value of our performance based restricted stock unit awards on the date of grant  we use a monte carlo simulation valuation method 
the restricted stock units are subject to a market condition based on the relative total shareholder return of adtran against a peer group of companies grant or against all companies in the nasdaq telecommunications index and grants and vest at the end of a three year performance period 
the fair value of restricted stock issued to our directors in is equal to the closing price of our stock on the date of grant 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate the estimated fair value of stock based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and we use different assumptions in the application of the stock compensation topic of the fasb asc in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  and establish reserves where we believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income in certain jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize these deferred tax assets in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
at december  and respectively  the valuation allowance was million and million 
as of december   we have state research tax credit carry forwards of million  which will expire between and these carry forwards were caused by tax credits in excess of our annual tax liabilities to an individual state where we no longer generate sufficient state income 
in addition  as of december   we have a deferred tax asset of million relating to net operating loss carry forwards which will expire between and these carry forwards are the result of an acquisition in and another in the acquired net operating losses are in excess of the amount of estimated earnings 
in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc  we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize the full benefits of our deferred tax asset arising from these credits and net operating losses  and accordingly  have provided a valuation allowance against them 
this valuation allowance is included in non current deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 

table of contents our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects 
we accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products 
the increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences  when they arise  to be more costly 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  material usage  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty expense 
alternatively  if we provide for more reserves than we require  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we use the acquisition method to account for business combinations 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired 
the acquisition method of accounting requires us to exercise judgment and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including the fair values of inventory  deferred revenue  identifiable intangible assets and deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
this method also requires us to refine these estimates over a one year measurement period to reflect information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have affected the measurement of the asset and liabilities recorded on that date  which could affect our net income 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if we determine that the two step quantitative test is necessary  then we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss is measured 
there were no impairment losses during results of operations the following table presents selected financial information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of sales for the years indicated

effect of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu requires companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
while asu changes the presentation of comprehensive income  it does not change the components that are recognized in net income or comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
we plan to adopt this amendment during the first quarter of since asu affects presentation only  it will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
asu defers the effective date for certain presentation requirements that relate to reclassification adjustments and the effect of those reclassification adjustments on the financial statements 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
we plan to adopt this amendment during the first quarter of since asu affects presentation only  it will have no effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu is intended to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments are of two types i those that clarify the board s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and ii those that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this update is effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents during  we adopted the following accounting standards  which had no material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu provides amendments to the criteria in subtopic of the asc for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
as a result of those amendments  multiple deliverable arrangements are separated in more circumstances than under previously existing us gaap 
asu established a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and replaced the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
asu also eliminated the residual method of allocation and required that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method and required that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
we generally sell our products and services separately  but in some circumstances products and services may be sold in bundles that contain multiple deliverables 
a sale that includes multiple deliverables is evaluated to determine the units of accounting  and the revenue from the arrangement is allocated to each item requiring separate revenue recognition based on the relative selling price and corresponding terms of the contract 
we strive to use vendor specific objective evidence of selling price 
when this evidence is not available  we are generally not able to determine third party evidence of selling price because of the extent of customization among competing products or services from other companies 
in these cases  estimated selling price is determined based on the particular circumstances of the arrangement and is used to allocate revenues to each unit of accounting 
revenue is recognized incrementally as the necessary criteria for each item are met 
we adopted this amendment during the first quarter of the adoption of this amendment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software arrangements 
asu changed the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance in subtopic of the asc 
in addition  asu requires that hardware components of a tangible product containing software components always be excluded from the software revenue guidance 
in that regard  asu provides additional guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product also would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
asu also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software 
asu also provides further guidance on how to allocate arrangement consideration when an arrangement includes deliverables both included and excluded from the scope of the software revenue guidance 
we adopted this amendment during the first quarter of the adoption of this amendment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu 
existing accounting guidance requires that an entity perform a test for goodwill impairment  on at least an annual basis  by first comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the second step of the test is to be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
asu will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this amendment during the fourth quarter of the adoption of this amendment had no effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  subsequent events on january   the board declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share to be paid to stockholders of record at the close of business on february  the quarterly dividend payment was million and was paid on february

we are directly exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent that such changes affect our revenue derived from international customers  expenses related to our foreign sales offices  and our foreign assets and liabilities 
we attempt to manage these risks by primarily denominating contractual and other foreign arrangements in us dollars 
our primary exposure in regard to our foreign assets and liabilities is with our australian subsidiary whose functional currency is the australian dollar 
we are indirectly exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent of our use of foreign contract manufacturers and foreign raw material suppliers whom we pay in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the local currency rates of these vendors in relation to the us dollar could cause an increase in the price of products that we purchase
