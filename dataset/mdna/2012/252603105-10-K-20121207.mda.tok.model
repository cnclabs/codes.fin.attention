item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are an innovative packaged food company founded in and currently focused on building and energizing brands 
we specialize in processing  marketing and distributing snack products and culinary  in shell and ingredient nuts 
in  we complemented our strong heritage in the culinary nut market under the diamond of california brand by launching a line of snack nuts under the emerald brand 
in september  we acquired the pop secret brand of microwave popcorn products  which provided us with increased scale in the snack market  supply chain economies of scale and cross promotional opportunities with our existing brands 
in march  we acquired kettle foods  a leading premium potato chip company in the two largest potato chip markets in the world  the united states and the united kingdom  which added the complementary premium kettle brand to our existing portfolio of brands in the snack industry 
in general  we sell directly to retailers  particularly larger national grocery store and drug store chains  and indirectly through wholesale distributors to independent and small regional retail grocery store chains and convenience stores 
we sell our products to global  national  regional and independent grocery  drug and convenience store chains  as well as to mass merchandisers  club stores  other retail channels and non retail channels  such as global ingredient nut customers 
our business is seasonal 
demand for nut products  particularly in shell nuts and to a lesser extent culinary nuts  is highest during the months of october  november and december 
in sourcing walnuts  we contract directly with growers for their walnut crop 
we typically receive walnuts during the period from september to november  and we pay for the crop throughout the year in accordance with our walnut purchase agreements with the growers 
we typically receive pecans during the period from october to march  and we pay for our pecan receipts over such period 
as a result of this seasonality  our personnel and working capital requirements and walnut inventories peak during the last four months of the calendar year 
we experience seasonality in capacity utilization at our stockton  california and fishers  indiana facilities associated with the annual walnut harvest and seasonal in shell and culinary product demand 
refer to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on diamond s plan to consolidate its manufacturing operations and close its facility in fishers 
generally  we receive and pay for approximately of the corn for popcorn in october  and approximately in march 
we contract for potatoes and oil annually and receive and pay for supply throughout the year 
generally  demand for potato chips is highest in the months of june  july and august in the united states  and november and december in the united kingdom 
accordingly  the working capital requirement of our popcorn and potato chip product lines is less seasonal than that of the tree nut product lines 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
the amount we accrue for promotion is based on an estimate of the level of performance of the trade promotion  which is dependent upon factors such as historical trends with similar promotions  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and sales and payment trends with similar previously offered programs 
customers have the right to return certain products 
product returns are estimated based upon historical results and are reflected as a reduction in sales 

table of contents inventories 
all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or weighted average or market basis 
we have entered into walnut purchase agreements with growers  under which they deliver their walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season  and pursuant to our walnut purchase agreement  we determine the price for this inventory after delivery and by the end of the fiscal year 
this purchase price is determined by us based on our discretion provided in the agreements  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality and nut varieties  among other relevant factors 
since the ultimate purchase price to be paid will be determined subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  we estimate the final purchase price for our interim financial statements 
those interim estimates may subsequently change due to changes in the factors described above and the effect of the change could be significant 
any such changes in estimates are accounted for in the period of change by adjusting inventory or cost of goods sold if inventory is sold through 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or more often if there are indications of possible impairment 
the analysis to determine whether or not an asset is impaired requires significant judgments that are dependent on internal forecasts  including estimated future cash flows  estimates of long term growth rates for our business  the expected life over which cash flows will be realized and assumed royalty and discount rates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and any impairment charge 
while the fair value of these assets exceeds their carrying value based on our current estimates and assumptions  materially different estimates and assumptions in the future in response to changing economic conditions  changes in our business or for other reasons could result in the recognition of impairment losses 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangible assets subject to amortization  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
for brand intangible assets not subject to amortization  we test for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing brand intangibles for impairment  we compare the fair value with the carrying value 
the determination of fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis  using inputs such as forecasted future revenues attributable to the brand  assumed royalty rates and a risk adjusted discount rate that approximates our estimated cost of capital 
if the company were to experience a decrease in forecasted future revenues attributable to the brands  this could indicate a potential impairment 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  the brand intangible asset is considered impaired  and an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the brand intangible asset 
at june   the brand intangible asset had a carrying value that was approximately over the fair value of the brand intangible asset 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test required by asc as of june th of each year 
in testing goodwill for impairment  we initially compare the fair value of our single reporting unit with the net book value of the company since it represents the carrying value of the reporting unit 
we have one operating and reportable segment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  we perform an additional step to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all assets and liabilities and then computing the excess of the reporting unit s fair value over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the excess represents the amount of goodwill 
table of contents impairment 
accordingly  we would recognize an impairment loss in the amount of such excess 
we also consider the estimated fair value of our reporting unit in relation to our market capitalization 
at july   the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately million  compared to total assets of approximately  million and total shareholders equity of approximately million 
at july   the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets totaled approximately million  compared to total assets of approximately  million and total shareholders equity of approximately million 
goodwill was determined not to be impaired as of june  the estimated market capitalization calculated in this analysis was above the carrying value 
this estimate was based on our stock price on june  at a value of 
in november  we performed step of the goodwill impairment analysis in accordance with asc  by comparing the estimated fair value of our single reporting unit in relation to our market capitalization  including an estimate for control premium 
this review was triggered by the decline in our share price as a result of the filing of our fiscal and fiscal restatement of the consolidated financial statements on november  goodwill was determined not to be impaired 
the estimated market capitalization calculated in this analysis was above the carrying value 
this estimate was based on our stock price within a range from november  to november  our stock price dropped from on august  to on july  and on november  based on a sensitivity analysis  it is estimated that if our stock price declines by a significant percentage  this could indicate a potential goodwill impairment 
we cannot guarantee that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
to the extent our market capitalization  increased by a reasonable control premium  results in a fair value of our common stock that is below our net book value  or if other indicators of potential impairment are present  then we will be required to take further steps to determine if an impairment of goodwill has occurred and to calculate an impairment loss 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
derivative financial instruments 
we account for the warrants issued as part of the oaktree transaction as freestanding derivative financial instruments 
we record derivative financial instruments at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet at the point the transaction is entered into and at the end of all subsequent reporting periods 
on a quarterly basis  changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument are recorded in current period earnings 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
this guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
this guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if any additional valuation allowance is necessary when it is more likely than not that amounts will not be recovered 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable  but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority 
we evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the guidance on uncertainty in income taxes 
we review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  and adjust them accordingly 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
under this guidance  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased snack sales and increased culinary and retail in shell sales 
sales incentives primarily promotional allowances  coupons and slotting as a percentage of gross sales increased approximately year over year 
sales incentives are recorded in net sales and are a reduction of sales 
the impact of foreign exchange on our net sales was not significant for fiscal net sales by channel in thousands year ended july  change from to snack culinary and retail in shell total retail international non retail north american ingredient food service other total non retail total net sales the volume of snack sales decreased by from fiscal to fiscal the volume of culinary and retail in shell sales was flat from fiscal to fiscal higher pricing  net of promotional spending  was reflected across all channels as we increased pricing to offset higher input costs 
international non retail sales decreased in fiscal due to a decline in sales volume  mainly as a result of a decrease in walnuts sold to customers in international markets after servicing retail customer demand 
north american ingredient food service and other sales increased slightly in fiscal as a result of additional walnut inventory on hand as of july  as compared to the prior year  allowing for higher sales volume ahead of the crop 
the number of contracted walnut growers and delivered pounds decreased in fiscal  reducing available walnut supply and contributing to a decline in earnings 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to a substantial decline in walnut crop deliveries and higher commodity costs  particularly for walnuts  partially offset by price increases taken in response to those rising costs

net interest expense was million and million  and and of net sales  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to issuance expenses associated with the oaktree agreements  and the third party costs incurred in connection with the second amendment  defined below  and the third amendment to our secured credit facility third amendment 
the increase is also due to the higher interest rate on the oaktree agreements 
see liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to not benefiting tax losses by establishing a valuation allowance on federal and state net deferred assets taxes in the three months ended april  in q as a result of cumulative losses  the company concluded that a valuation allowance was required on certain us and state deferred tax assets principally net operating losses nol s and california ez credits as it was management s assessment that it was no longer more likely than not that those assets could be realized 
our fiscal effective tax rate was also impacted by discrete tax benefits  and the conclusion of a tax ruling with the united kingdom tax authorities 
this resulted in a net tax benefit of million  attributable to the reversal of our unrecognized tax benefit related to this event 
our effective rate was lower than the statutory rate due to earnings taxed at lower rates in the uk and by discrete tax benefits  primarily deferred tax adjustments for enacted tax law change in the uk  wisconsin and california

retail sales for fiscal included only four months of kettle foods sales 
the volume of snack sales  other than sales of kettle foods products  increased by from fiscal to fiscal culinary and retail in shell sales increased in fiscal as a result of price increases that were partially offset by an decrease in volume 
international non retail sales increased in fiscal due to higher sales volume  mainly as a result of a record walnut crop that was sold to customers in international markets after servicing retail customer demand 
north american ingredient food service and other sales decreased primarily because the united states department of agriculture school lunch program was not offered in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively

table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
our effective tax rates were lower than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in the united kingdom uk tax jurisdiction 
our fiscal effective tax rate was also impacted by discrete tax benefits  primarily deferred tax adjustments for enacted tax law change in the uk  wisconsin and california 
in fiscal  our effective tax rate was lower than the us federal statutory rate due  also and primarily  to earnings taxed at lower rates in the uk 
the decrease was offset  partially  by an effective tax rate increase in fiscal due to non deductible acquisition costs related to the kettle acquisition 
proposed pringles merger terminated on april   diamond entered into a definitive agreement with the procter gamble company p g to merge p g s pringles business into the company  on february   diamond and p g mutually agreed to terminate this proposed merger

liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is dependent upon funds generated from operations and external sources of financing 
cash used in operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million of cash provided by operating activities during fiscal the change from cash provided by operating activities to cash used in operating activities was primarily due to significant expenditures related to acquisition  integration  and investigation related activities and higher walnut costing 
cash used in investing activities was million during fiscal year compared to million during fiscal the lower cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the completion of our beloit  wisconsin plant expansion  which was partially funded by the restricted cash received in fiscal the company expects lower capital expenditures during fiscal compared to previous fiscal years due to the company s effort to reduce costs 
cash provided by financing activities was million during fiscal compared to million cash used in financing activities during fiscal the change from cash used in financing activities to cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to increased borrowings from the oaktree investment  which is described below 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million compared to million of cash used in operating activities during fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved working capital as accounts payable increased by million partly due to pringles merger costs as well as a million increase in accounts payable to growers driven by a larger and more costly walnut crop 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the higher cash used in investing activities for fiscal was mainly due to the acquisition of kettle foods 
fiscal investing activities included an increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment related to kettle foods facility expansions and software implementations 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million provided by financing activities in fiscal the change from the prior year was primarily attributable to long term borrowings and the equity offering used to fund the kettle foods acquisition 
at july   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents 
of this balance  million was held in the united kingdom in foreign currencies 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings at these locations in order to ensure sufficient working capital and expand operations 
applicable us income taxes have not been provided on approximately million of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries at july   because these earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested 
the net federal income tax liability that would arise if these earnings were not indefinitely reinvested is approximately million 
applicable us income taxes are provided on these earnings in the periods in which they are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested 
in the event that management elects for any reason 
table of contents in the future to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
in february  we entered into an agreement with a syndicate of lenders for a five year million secured credit facility the secured credit facility 
we used the borrowings under the secured credit facility to fund a portion of the kettle foods acquisition and to fund ongoing operations 
our secured credit facility initially consisted of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
in march  the syndicate of lenders approved our request for a million increase in our revolving credit facility to million  under the same terms 
in august  the syndicate of lenders approved our request for a million increase in our revolving credit facility to million  under the same terms 
in may  the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million as part of the third amendment 
as of july   the revolving credit facility had million in capacity  of which million was outstanding 
the capacity under the revolving credit facility is scheduled to decrease to million effective july  and million effective january  in may  we made a million pre payment on the term loan facility as part of the third amendment 
as of july   the term loan facility had million in capacity  of which million was outstanding 
in addition  scheduled principal payments on the term loan facility were million due quarterly  with the remaining principal balance and any outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility to be repaid on february  substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets are considered collateral security under the secured credit facility 
the secured credit facility provides for customary affirmative and negative covenants and cross default provisions that may be triggered if diamond fails to comply with obligations under their other credit facilities or indebtedness 
as of july   we had obtained covenant relief under the third amendment  as described below 
the restatement of diamond s fiscal and fiscal consolidated financial statements rendered the company non compliant with certain financial and reporting covenants  which non compliance was waived as a result of the forbearance agreement 
please refer below for information regarding the forbearance agreement 
in march  we issued  shares of common stock priced at per share 
after deducting the underwriting discount and other related expenses  we received total net proceeds from the sale of our common stock of approximately million 
the proceeds from the equity offering were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the kettle foods acquisition 
in december  kettle foods obtained  and we guaranteed  a year fixed rate loan the guaranteed loan in the principal amount of million  of which million was outstanding as of july  principal and interest payments are due monthly throughout the term of the loan 
the guaranteed loan is being used to purchase equipment for our beloit  wisconsin plant expansion 
borrowed funds were placed in an interest bearing escrow account 
withdrawals from the escrow account were restricted to reimburse  dollar for dollar  approved expenditures directly related to equipment purchases 
as the cash is being used to purchase non current assets  such restricted cash is classified as non current on the balance sheet 
the guaranteed loan provides for customary affirmative and negative covenants  which are similar to the covenants under the secured credit facility  such as limiting our debt to ebitda ratio to no more than to  and our fixed charge coverage ratio to no less than to 
the financial covenants within the guaranteed loan were reset to match those in the third amendment 
on march   we reached an agreement with our lenders to forbear from seeking any remedies under the secured credit facility with respect to specified existing and anticipated non compliance with the credit agreement and to amend our credit agreement second amendment 
under the amended credit agreement  we had continued access to our existing revolving credit facility through a forbearance period initially through june  subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the amended credit agreement 
during the forbearance period  the interest rate on borrowings increased 
the amended credit agreement required us to suspend dividend payments to stockholders 
in addition  we paid a forbearance fee of to our lenders 
the forbearance period concluded on may   when we closed agreements to recapitalize our balance sheet with an investment by oaktree capital management  lp oaktree 

table of contents the oaktree investment initially consists of million of newly issued senior notes and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of diamond common stock 
the senior notes will mature in and bear interest at per year that may be paid in kind at our option for the first two years 
oaktree s warrants will be exercisable at per share starting on march  the oaktree agreements provide that if we secure a specified minimum supply of walnuts from the crop and achieve profitability targets for our nut businesses for the six month period ending january   all of the warrants will be cancelled and oaktree may exchange million of the senior notes for convertible preferred stock of diamond the special redemption 
the convertible preferred stock would have an initial conversion price of  which represents a discount to the closing price of diamond common stock on april   the date that we entered into our commitment with oaktree 
the convertible preferred stock would pay a dividend that would be paid in kind for the first two years 
diamond does not currently anticipate that the special redemption will occur 
on may   we entered into a waiver and the third amendment  which provided for a lower level of total bank debt  initially at million  along with substantial covenant relief until october  at that time  these covenants will become applicable at revised levels set forth in the third amendment initially to for the senior leverage ratio  declining over four quarters to to in the quarter ending july  and thereafter  and to for the fixed charge coverage ratio for each fiscal quarter 
the third amendment includes a new covenant requiring that we have at least million of cash  cash equivalents and revolving credit availability beginning february  refer below for discussion on how we expect to meet the covenant 
in addition  the third amendment required a million pre payment of the term loan facility  while reducing the remaining scheduled principal payments on the term loan facility from million to million 
the third amendment also amends the definition of applicable rate under the secured credit agreement which sets the margin over libor and the base rate at which loans under the secured credit agreement bear interest 
initially  eurodollar rate loans will bear interest at plus the libor for the applicable loan period  and base rate loans will bear interest at plus the highest of i the federal funds rate plus  ii the prime rate  or iii eurodollar rate plus 
the libor rate is subject to a libor floor  initially the libor floor 
the margins over libor  the libor floor  and the base rate will decline if and when we achieve specified reductions in our ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the third amendment also eliminates the requirement that proceeds of future equity issuances be applied to repay outstanding loans  and waives certain covenants that we were non compliant with in connection with our restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
the secured credit facility and the securities purchase agreement  dated as of may   by and between diamond and ocm pf ff adamantine holdings  ltd 
the oaktree spa provide for customary affirmative and negative covenants  and cross default provisions that may be triggered if we fail to comply with obligations under our other credit facilities or indebtedness 
the secured credit facility and the oaktree spa included a covenant that restricts the amount of other indebtedness including capital leases and purchase money obligations for fixed or capital assets  to no more than million 
the accounting treatment for the seven year equipment lease for our salem  oregon plant the kettle us lease and the five year equipment lease for our norfolk  uk plant the kettle uk lease caused us to be in default of the covenants limiting other indebtedness 
these defaults were waived  with respect to the kettle uk lease on july  fourth amendment  and with respect to the kettle us lease on august  fifth amendment 
additionally  the secured credit facility and the oaktree spa were each amended to allow the company to incur up to million of capital leases and purchase money obligations for fixed or capital assets  which amount will be reduced from and after december  a to million under the secured credit facility and b to million under the oaktree spa 
working capital and stockholders equity were million and million at july   compared to million and million at july  the increase in working capital was due to a decrease in payable to growers due to reduced crop volume and a decrease in the current portion of long term debt due to a reduction in the remaining scheduled principal payments as part of the third amendment  partially offset by the warrant liability related to oaktree recorded in fiscal 
table of contents we believe our cash and cash equivalents  cash expected to be provided from our operations  borrowings available under our secured credit facility  and restricted cash provided by the guaranteed loan  will be sufficient to fund our contractual commitments  repay obligations as required and fund our operational requirements for at least the next months

d excludes million in deferred rent liabilities 
additionally  the liability for uncertain tax positions million at july   excluding associated interest and penalties has been excluded from the contractual obligations table because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 
off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts  corn  potatoes  oils and other ingredients 
the prices of these commodities are affected by us and world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation is likely to however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices  interest rates on borrowings and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality  and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds  other nuts  corn  potatoes and oils are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the exposure to our cash equivalents for changes in interest rates  which are primarily affected by credit quality and the type of cash equivalents we hold 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not be significant 
interest rate volatility could also materially affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  as well as the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver 
the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver are dependent on libor 
we feel a basis point increase or decrease on our variable interest rates would not be significant 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk 
we have operations outside the us with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily in the united kingdom 
because we have foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  financial exposure may result  primarily from the timing of transactions and the movement of exchange rates 
the foreign currency balance sheet exposures as of july  are not expected to result in a significant impact on future earnings or cash flows 
however  in july  we entered into a series of foreign exchange collars to hedge a portion of our expected canadian dollar denominated receivables of kettle foods between september and january  which were subsequently extended through july in september  we entered into a series of foreign exchange participating forwards to hedge a portion of our expected canadian dollar denominated receivables of emerald between november and august our sales of finished goods and purchases of raw materials and supplies from outside the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
thus  certain revenues and expenses have been  and are expected to be  subject to the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  and these fluctuations may have an impact on operating results
