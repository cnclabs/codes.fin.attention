overview we are a national clinical diagnostic laboratory located in northeastern new jersey 
we are a national laboratory in certain focused areas of laboratory testing and a full service laboratory in the new york super region 
we have developed a national reputation for our expertise in certain focused areas of clinical testing 
genpath  the name by which we are known for our cancer and oncology services  is recognized for the superior hematopathology services it provides throughout the country 
our women s health initiative  through which we provide dedicated services for obstetrics and gynecology practices  including a unique  technically advanced multiplex process for identifying sexually transmitted infections  is also offered as genpath 
our regional footprint lays within the new york city metropolitan area and the surrounding areas of new jersey and southern new york state as well eastern pennsylvania and some areas of western connecticut  we also provide services further into new york state  pennsylvania  delaware and maryland 
as a regional provider  we are a full service laboratory that primarily services physician office practices  our drivers pick up samples and deliver reports and supplies  we provide sophisticated technical support  phlebotomy services or patient service centers where appropriate  and electronic communication services in many cases 
physicians outside of our regional footprint send samples to our laboratory in order to take advantage of the expertise that we are able to provide in blood based cancer pathology and associated diagnostics or to take advantage of the superior service  support and technologically advanced testing we offer in our women s health initiative 
our correctional healthcare services are used throughout the country at prisons and jails 
the focused markets we serve on a national basis outside of our regional footprint do not require many of the logistical and other ancillary support services required within the region 
even within our regional footprint  we provide the same services that we provide on a national basis as well as some regional focused diagnostic services  such as histology and pathology support services  substance abuse testing  fertility testing  hemostasis testing  women s health testing  and molecular diagnostics that are unavailable from many of the smaller regional competitors  testing in some of these areas may be provided outside of physician offices 
over the last few years  there have been fundamental changes in the laboratory services industry 
in the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the growth of managed care  increased government regulation  and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial laboratories 
there are currently only three us publicly traded full service laboratories operating in the us while that means that the two national mega laboratories and bio reference laboratories are the only remaining publicly traded full service commercial laboratories  there are numerous hospital outreach programs and smaller reference laboratories that compete for the commercial clinical laboratory business scattered throughout the country 
clinical laboratories have had to improve efficiency  leverage economies of scale  comply with government regulations and other laws and develop more profitable approaches to pricing 
moreover  there has been a proliferation of technology advancements in clinical diagnostics over the last decade that has created significant opportunities for new testing and growth 
as a full service clinical laboratory  we are constantly looking for new technologies and new methodologies that will help us to grow 
since the turn of the century  our size alone has made us attractive to companies that are driving the advances in technology 
we represent a significant opportunity for these companies to market their products with a nationally recognized specialty provider in our focused areas of specialty or in one of the major population centers of the world the new york metropolitan area 
we have had several successful strategic relationships with such technology opportunities 
in addition to new technology opportunities  we have an extremely seasoned and talented management staff that has been able to identify emerging laboratory markets that are under served or under utilized 
we have recently developed programs for cardiology  histology and women s health to go along with our existing hemostasis  hematopathology and correctional healthcare initiatives which have already been established and in which we have been increasing our market share for the past several years 
we are currently preparing to launch a comprehensive pre natal program to leverage our presence in the women s health environment and we will continue to vigilantly seek focused diagnostic marketing opportunities where we can provide information  technology  service or support that expand and grow our clinical laboratory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the operating assets of genedx  a leading dna sequencing laboratory 
as molecular testing in general becomes a more significant element in the diagnostic testing industry  the company believes that genetic testing will become an essential diagnostic tool of the future 
genedx was started by two geneticists from the national institute of health nih in over the next six years  based on the reputation and expertise of the founders and the outstanding team they built around themselves  along with a very focused and dedicated understanding of the science of genetics  genedx became known as one of the premier genetic testing laboratories for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases 
the company believed that the promise of genetic testing is in the diagnosis of the genetic variants of common diseases 
it has been the company s intention to leverage the expertise and reputation of genedx in order to take a leadership role in the expanding area of genetic testing 
the company is seeking cutting edge methods of testing that will be commercially viable diagnostic tools for the advancement of genetic testing 
in  genedx introduced genomedx  a then new test based on cgh array technology  a high speed  chip based technology that has allowed genedx to move to the forefront of an emerging technology platform 
in  genedx became the first commercial laboratory in the world to offer next generation nextgen sequencing high speed computer based whole genome sequencing and has since built up a comprehensive suite of cardiac arrhythmia panels  as well as other multi gene testing panels  that have enhanced its reputation as a technology and service leader in the area of genetic testing 
the company is already expanding the menu of tests offered and employing marketing techniques that were extremely successful in building genpath  our oncology laboratory 
in addition to scientists and technicians to manage testing  genedx employs genetic counselors and geneticists to help patients and referring physicians and geneticists understand the meaning of the test results 
on march   the company completed the purchase of lenetix medical screening laboratory  inc lenetix from lenetix and its sole stockholder 
these assets were utilized in lenetix s operation of a clinical testing laboratory located in mineola  new york 
the laboratory performs both clinical laboratory diagnostic testing and genetic testing 
on august   the company acquired all of the authorized  issued and outstanding shares of the genetics center  inc gci  a new york corporation engaged in the clinical laboratory business with principal place of business in smithtown  new york 
while we recognize that we are a clinical laboratory that processes samples  we also understand that we are an information company that needs to effectively communicate the results of our efforts back to healthcare providers 
laboratory results play a major role in the implementation of physician healthcare 
laboratory results are used to diagnose  monitor and classify health concerns 
in many cases  laboratory results represent the confirming data in diagnosing complicated health issues 
since laboratory results play such an important role in routine physician care  we have developed informatics solutions that leverage our role in healthcare 
we needed to build a web based solution to quickly  accurately  conveniently and competitively collect ordering information and deliver results  so we built an internal solution that we call careevolve 
that solution has been essential to our own operations 
we license the technology to other laboratories throughout the country that they utilize to more effectively compete against the national laboratories 
these other laboratories licensing our technology are typically not our competitors since they are outside our regional footprint 
we have also created our psimedica business unit that has developed a clinical knowledge management ckm system that takes data from enrollment  claims  pharmacy  laboratory results and any other available electronic source to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the system uses proprietary algorithms to cleanse and configure the data and transfer the resulting information into a healthcare data repository 
using advanced cube technology methodologies  the data can be analyzed from a myriad of views and from highly granular transactional detail to global trended overview 
events such as the katrina disaster in louisiana and general pressures from the government have made development of an electronic medical record system and pay for performance reimbursement priority goals in the healthcare industry 
a large portion of an individual s medical record consists of laboratory data and a key performance indicator in any pay for performance initiative is laboratory result data 
our ckm system is a mature  full functioning solution that will allow us to play a role in these important national initiatives 
to date  neither our psimedica business unit nor careevolve has produced significant revenues 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
during the fiscal year ended october   we increased our sales force by approximately in the specialty testing services that we market nationally 
this increase occurred in two phases one in january and one in july of the same year 
we believe that this increase in sales personnel accounted for a majority of the increase in our patient volume 
this allowed us to expand or increase our presence in sixteen states and we expect this trend to continue 
while there is always uncertainty as to the sustainability of such growth in the future  we believe that our historical performance of compound annual growth rate for the past years  the current demand for our services and our continued corporate focus on strategic growth  together with our expertise in the industry  should enable us to sustain continued strong growth in the near term 
going beyond that  however  the company s revenues and patient counts could be adversely affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to an extended downturn in general or healthcare economic conditions  an unexpected reduction in reimbursement rates  increased market penetration by our competitors  or a substantial adverse change in federal regulatory requirements governing our industry as well as a failure to continue the sizeable annual percentage increase in base business from significantly higher levels after years of sustained growth 
cost of services cost of services for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of as compared to a increase in net revenues 
the company s reagents and laboratory supplies expense increased by due to the higher cost of specialty testing reagents 
our vehicle operating expenses also increased by due to the higher cost of fuel 
our medical equipment repair costs increased by year over year due to higher equipment utilization rate 
we expect these trends to continue 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins decreased to for fiscal from fiscal rate of 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this is basically in line with the increase in net revenues 
marketing expenses increased by due to increases in our sales force together with substantial investment in marketing materials and we expect this trend to continue in the near future 
interest expense interest expense increased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   an increase of or 
this increase is due to an increase in utilization of the pnc bank line of credit  acquisition debt and capital leases 
management believes that this trend will continue in the near term due to the increase in utilization rates 
net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
our diluted net income per share went from in fiscal to in fiscal  or on a pro forma basis without taking into account the following non recurring items the new jersey sales tax refund  the loss on sale of corporate aircraft and the new york excess laboratory fee refund fiscal year compared to fiscal year net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents a increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to a increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal and  in fiscal during the fiscal year ended october   we increased our sales force by approximately in the specialty testing services that we market nationally

while there is always uncertainty as to the sustainability of such growth in the future  we believe that our historical performance of compound annual growth rate for the past years  the current demand for our services and our continued corporate focus on strategic growth  together with our expertise in the industry  will allow our present growth trends to continue in the near future 
going beyond that  however  the company s revenues and patient counts could be adversely affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to an extended downturn in general or healthcare economic conditions  an unexpected reduction in reimbursement rates  increased market penetration by our competitors  or a substantial adverse change in federal regulatory requirements governing our industry as well as a failure to continue the sizeable annual percentage increase in base business from significantly higher levels after years of sustained growth 
the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
cost of services cost of services for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of as compared to a increase in net revenues 
therefore  this increase is basically in line with the increase in net revenues 
the company s reagents and laboratory supplies expense increased by due to the higher cost of specialty testing reagents 
our vehicle operating expenses also increased by due to the higher cost of fuel 
we expect these trends to continue 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins remained constant year over year at general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of  or 
this is basically in line with the increase in net revenues 
marketing expenses increased by due to increases in our sales force together with substantial investment in marketing materials and we expect this trend to continue in the near future 
interest expense interest expense increased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   an increase of this increase is due to an increase in utilization of the pnc bank line of credit  acquisition debt and capital leases

net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period 
our diluted net income per share went from in fiscal  or on a pro forma basis without taking into account the following non recurring item the restitution agreement to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our working capital at october  was approximately  as compared to approximately  at october   an increase of  
our cash position increased by approximately  during the current period 
we decreased our short term borrowing by approximately  and borrowed approximately  in long term debt 
we had current liabilities of approximately  at october  we generated approximately  in cash from operations  an increase of approximately  as compared to the year ended october  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  totaled approximately  at october   an increase of approximately  from october   or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
cash collected over the twelve month period ended october  increased over the prior twelve month period 
net service revenues on the statements of operations are as follows october  gross revenues contractual adjustments and discounts medicare medicaid portion all other third party and direct payors total contractual adjustments and discounts net service revenues percent of contractual adjustments and discounts to gross revenues all other third party and direct payors consists of almost eight hundred distinct payors  including commercial health insurers and administrators as well as professionally billed accounts such as physicians  hospitals  clinics and other direct billed accounts 
the table above illustrates the relationship between contractual adjustments and gross revenues for the fiscal years   and between and  contractual adjustments increased approximately basis points 
the average across the board collection percent for fiscal year was  while the rate for fiscal year was  a decrease in our collection rate of  or a reduction in the collection rate 
in the aggregate  this has resulted in a change of our contractual rate  leading to larger contractual allowances and lower net revenues when computed as a percentage of gross revenues 
although individual collection rates may vary from period to period or payor to payor  based on the specific historical data analyzed  this is consistent with the current state of the economy as well as the ongoing trends in health care reimbursement 
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising our client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
as a consequence  we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements 
a number of proposals for legislation continue to be under discussion which could substantially reduce medicare and medicaid cms reimbursements to clinical laboratories 
depending upon the nature of regulatory action  and the content of legislation  we could experience a significant decrease in revenues from medicare and medicaid cms  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are unable to predict  however  the extent to which such actions will be taken 
laboratory gross receivables by payor group fy days days days days total self pay medicare medicaid pro bill commercial insurance grand total fy days days days days total self pay medicare medicaid pro bill commercial insurance total billing for laboratory services is complicated and we must bill various payors  such as the individual  the insurance company  the government federal or state  the private company or the health clinic 
other factors that may complicate billing include differences between fee schedules and reimbursement rates  incomplete or inaccurate billing information as provided by the physician  disparity in coverage and information requirements  disputes with payors  and internal and external compliance policies and procedures 
significant costs are incurred as a result of our participation in government programs since billing and reimbursement for laboratory tests are subject to complex regulations 
we perform the requested tests and report the results whether the information is correct or not or even missing 
this adds to the complexity and slows the collection process and increases the aging of our accounts receivable a r 
when patient invoices are not collected in a timely manner the item is written off to the allowance 
days sales outstanding dso for fiscal years and were and  respectively  a decrease of approximately 
these changes are due to constant vigilance on the part of management and internal changes to collection practices 
however  when you compare our dso lag to our collectible net revenues as reported on our financial statements for the periods in question  it varies between to  depending on the period 
overall  the components of a r as shown above for the two most recently completed fiscal years under review have not varied much year over year 
the percent of a r over days has decreased to as of october  as compared to as of october   a decrease of only 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding outstanding loans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements describing our merger and acquisition activities 
the weighted average interest rate on short term borrowings outstanding as of october  and was approximately 
we intend to expand our laboratory operations through aggressive marketing while also attempting to diversify into related medical fields through acquisitions 
these acquisitions may involve cash  notes  common stock  and or combinations thereof 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of october  total fy fy fy fy fy thereafter long term debt capital leases operating leases purchase obligations long term liabilities under employment and consultant contracts no one supplier who is counterparty to any particular supply agreement is contracted to provide more than one percent of our cost of services in any future period 
such contracts are made in the ordinary course of business 
no directors  officers  promoters  voting trustees or individuals known to be bio reference laboratories  inc brli security holders are counterparties to these agreements 
management does not believe that brli is substantially dependent upon these supply agreements  as the goods may be obtained from different suppliers or wholesalers  if needed 
none of these agreements are leases or call for the acquisition or sale of property  plant and equipment 
our cash balances at october  totaled approximately  as compared to approximately  at october  we believe that our cash position  the anticipated cash generated from future operations  and the availability of our credit line with pnc bank  will meet our anticipated cash needs in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements as of october   we did not have any off balance sheet items 
impact of inflation to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
accounting for intangible and other long lived assets we evaluate the possible impairment of our long lived assets  including intangible assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
evaluation of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of the asset 
accounting for revenue service revenues are principally generated from laboratory testing services including chemical diagnostic tests such as blood analysis  urine analysis and genetic testing among others 
net service revenues are recognized at the time the testing services are performed and are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
net service revenues are determined utilizing gross service revenues net of contractual allowances 
even though it is the responsibility of the patient to pay for laboratory service bills  most individuals in the united states have an agreement with a third party payor such as medicare  medicaid or a commercial insurance provider to pay all or a portion of their healthcare expenses  the majority of services provided by bio reference laboratories  inc brli are to patients covered under a third party payor contract 
in certain cases  the individual has no insurance or does not provide insurance information and in other cases tests are performed under contract to a professional organization such as physicians  hospitals  and clinics which reimburse brli directly  in the remainder of the cases  brli is provided the third party billing information and seeks payment from the third party under the terms and conditions of the third party payor for health service providers like brli 
each of these third party payors may differ not only with regard to rates  but also with regard to terms and conditions of payment and providing coverage reimbursement for specific tests 
estimated revenues are established based on a series of highly complex procedures and judgments that require industry specific healthcare experience and an understanding of payor methods and trends 
we review our calculations on a monthly basis in order to make certain that we are properly allowing for the uncollectable portion of our gross billings and that our estimates remain sensitive to variances and changes within our payor groups 
the contractual allowance calculation is made on the basis of historical allowance rates for the various specific payor groups on a monthly basis with a greater weight being given to the most recent trends  this process is adjusted based on recent changes in underlying contract provisions and shifts in the testing being performed 
bad debt represents our estimate of net revenues that will ultimately be uncollectable and is based upon our analysis of historical payment rates by specific payor groups on a monthly basis with primary weight being given to the most recent trends  this approach allows bad debt to more accurately adjust to short term changes in the business environment 
these two calculations are routinely analyzed by brli on the basis of actual allowances issued by payors and the actual payments made to determine what adjustments  if any  are needed 
the chart below shows the adjustments made to gross service revenues to arrive at net service revenues 
october  gross revenues contractual adjustments and discounts medicare medicaid portion all other third party and direct payors total contractual adjustments and discounts net service revenues percent of contractual adjustments and discounts to gross revenues all other third party and direct payors consists of almost eight hundred distinct payors  including commercial health insurers and administrators as well as professionally billed accounts such as physicians  hospitals  clinics and other direct billed accounts 
when new business is received by brli  net service revenues are calculated by reducing gross service revenues by the estimated contractual allowance 
the bad debt expense is determined by calculating the appropriate collection rate for net current service revenues and is a component of general and administrative expenses 
brli recognized the amounts in subsequent periods for actual allowances discounts to gross service revenue  bad debt was adjusted over the same periods of time to maintain an accurate balance between net service revenues and actual revenues 
management has reviewed the allowances discounts recognized in subsequent periods and believes the amounts to be immaterial 
a number of proposals for legislation or regulation continue to be under discussion which could have the effect of substantially reducing medicare reimbursements for clinical laboratories or introducing cost sharing to beneficiaries 
depending upon the nature of regulatory action  if any  which is taken and the content of legislation  if any  which is adopted  the company could experience a significant decrease in revenues from medicare and medicaid cms  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is unable to predict  however  the extent to which such actions will be taken 
accounting for contractual credits and doubtful accounts it is typically the responsibility of the patient to pay for laboratory service bills 
most individuals in the united states have an agreement with a third party payor such as medicare  medicaid or commercial insurance to pay all or a portion of their healthcare expenses  this represents the major portion of payment for all services provided to brli 
in certain cases  the individual has no insurance or does not provide insurance information  in the remainder of the cases  brli is provided the third party billing information  usually by the referring physician  and seeks payment from the third party under the terms and conditions of the third party payor for health service providers like brli 
each of these third party payors may differ not only with regard to rates  but also with regard to terms and conditions of payment and coverage of specific tests 
brli routinely reviews the reimbursement policies and subsequent payments and collection rates from these different types of payors 
contractual credits are recorded as reductions to gross service revenues and are collectively referred to as the contractual allowance 
brli has not been required to record an adjustment in a subsequent period related to revenue recorded in a prior period which was material in nature 
aging of accounts receivable is monitored by billing personnel and follow up activities including collection efforts are conducted as necessary 
bad debt expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses 
brli writes off receivables against the allowance for doubtful accounts when they are deemed uncollectible 
for client billing  accounts are written off when all reasonable collection efforts prove to be unsuccessful 
patient accounts  where the patient is directly responsible for all or a remainder portion of the account after partial payment or denial by a third party payor  are written off after the normal dunning cycle has occurred  although these may be subsequently transferred to a third party collection agency after being written off 
third party payor accounts are written off when they exceed the payor s timely filing limits 
accounts receivable on the balance sheet is net of the following amounts for contractual credits and doubtful accounts october contractual credits discounts doubtful accounts total allowance accounting for employee benefit plans see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on employee benefit plans
