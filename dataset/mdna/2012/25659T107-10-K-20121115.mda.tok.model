item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and item a  risk factors 
developing new audio entertainment technologies through our long history of innovation in audio technology  and the established presence of our multichannel technologies in many of the world s most popular content playback devices  we believe that we are well positioned to develop and deliver new audio innovations 
specifically  our expertise in signal processing and compression technologies  coupled with our ability to deliver an integrated solution across complex market ecosystems  enable us to offer new technologies that elevate the entertainment experience 
we also believe the presence of our technologies in many existing professional and consumer devices  along with our recognized brand  are key strengths as we strive to bring additional technology innovations to market 
in april  we announced dolby atmos  a new audio platform for cinema that delivers a more natural and realistic sound field 
since the introduction of dolby atmos  nine major hollywood titles have been announced or released from five studios  including the hobbit  to be released in december developing video technologies our success in audio has resulted in part from our ability to develop and deliver the products  services  tools  and technologies needed to capture  deliver  and play back a consistent  high quality audio experience across multiple channels 
we believe these core competencies can be applied to video to significantly improve the technology currently used to deliver premium video to displays 
in the cinema market  we offer exhibitors our digital cinema servers and other d digital cinema products  which deliver a vivid movie experience with sharp images and natural colors 
we also offer a professional reference monitor  a flat panel video reference display for video professionals 
these professionals use our monitor for color critical tasks  such as calibrating color accuracy to professional reference standards 
our professional reference monitor uses our dynamic range imaging technologies  which enable enhanced contrast  extended brightness  and dynamic range  along with reduced power consumption in led backlit lcd televisions 
developing voice technologies with the growth of voice transmission over internet protocol networks and the proliferation of devices that connect to these networks  the quality of the voice experience has progressively deteriorated 
we believe that our expertise in sound signal processing and compression technologies can address some of these problems  and in particular that our entertainment technologies can be adapted and applied to voice communications to significantly improve voice quality and clarity in a variety of uses 
in september  bt conferencing announced a trial using dolby voice technology in their conferencing services to enable audio conference calls that sound and feel more like in person meetings 
building on the strength of the dolby brand we are building on the strength of the dolby brand to enhance our reputation as a trusted provider of entertainment technologies for professional and consumer applications and to assist us in bringing new audio and video technologies to 
table of contents market 
we actively encourage our customers to place our trademarks on their products in conjunction with the inclusion of our technologies 
in particular  we provide marketing materials such as posters  trailers  and plaques to cinema operators to help them promote the quality of experience that is associated with our brand 
the inclusion of the dolby trademark on a product informs audiences and consumers that the product incorporates our technologies and meets our quality standards  and we believe this helps ce oems sell their products 
we will continue to encourage the use of our trademarks throughout the entertainment industry as an indicator to both professionals and consumers of consistent quality at each stage of the entertainment process 
addressing ongoing content creator needs we believe that technology innovations for entertainment will continue to be adopted first for professional use  as filmmakers  music producers  broadcasters  and video game designers look for ways to excite their audiences 
we are collaborating with industry professionals to develop new technologies that facilitate and improve content recording  distribution  and playback 
our professional technology solutions often have applicability to the consumer arena  and when they apply  we intend to continue to adapt these technologies for use in consumer applications 
our noise reduction  surround sound  and digital audio technologies were all initially developed for professional use and later adapted for use in ce products 
we believe that our success in developing technologies for professional use contributes greatly to the appeal of our technologies and brand for consumer use 
promoting the adoption of dolby technologies in industry standards as the entertainment industry evolves toward global technical standards for content creation  delivery  and playback  we actively seek to have our technologies included in industry standards 
we develop  maintain  and strengthen relationships across the broad spectrum of entertainment industry participants  professional organizations  and global standards setting bodies 
revenue generation we generate revenue in three primary ways licensing our technologies to a broad range of customers  selling video and audio products for the cinema and broadcast industries  and providing a variety of services to support production activities 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from outside the us geographic data for our licensing revenue is based on the location of our licensees headquarters 
products revenue is based on the destination to which we ship our products  while services revenue is based on the location where services are performed 
financial information by geographic area is set forth in note geographic data to our consolidated financial statements 
for risks attendant to our foreign operations  see item a  risk factors 
licensing we license our technologies to software vendors and to oems of ce products such as digital televisions  set top boxes  dvd players and recorders  blu ray disc players  video game consoles  audio video receivers  mobile devices  in car entertainment systems  home theater in a box systems  pcs  camcorders  and portable media devices 
our licensing arrangements typically entitle us to receive a specified royalty for every product shipped by our licensees that incorporates our technologies 
we also collect fees for administering joint patent licensing programs informally known as patent pools on behalf of third parties 
in fiscal   and  our licensing revenue represented   and of our total revenue  respectively 
we have three primary licensing models a two tier model  an integrated licensing model  and a patent pool model 
two tier licensing model 
most of our ce licensing business consists of a two tier licensing model whereby our decoding technologies  included in reference software and firmware code  are first provided under license to a semiconductor manufacturer 
the manufacturer then incorporates our technologies in integrated circuits ic 
our licensed semiconductor manufacturers  which we refer to as implementation licensees  sell their ics to oems of ce products  which we refer to as system licensees 
our system licensees separately obtain licenses from us that allow them to make and sell end user ce products that incorporate our technologies in ics purchased from our implementation licensees 
our implementation licensees may use our reference software and other licensed know how directly to build and sell core technologies such as ics 
the implementation licensees pay us a one time  up front administrative fee per license 
in exchange  the licensee receives a licensing package  which includes information useful in implementing our technologies into its chipsets 
once the chipset has been built  the licensee sends us a sample for quality control evaluation 
if we approve the implementation design  the licensee is permitted to sell the chipset only to our system licensees 

table of contents our system licensees pay us an initial fee for the technologies they choose to license from us 
we deliver a licensing package to each system licensee  which includes information on using our technologies in the licensee s products 
system licensees are required to provide us with prototypes of products that incorporate our technologies for quality control evaluation  or under certain circumstances  with self test results for our review 
if the design is approved  the licensee is permitted to buy ics from any dolby implementation licensee and to sell approved products to retailers  distributors  and consumers 
sales by system licensees of ce products incorporating our technologies are royalty bearing  generally based upon the number of product units shipped 
we have active licensing arrangements with approximately electronics product oems and software developer licensees  with corporate headquarters located in countries 
the amount of royalties we collect from a system licensee on a particular product depends on a number of factors  such as the number of dolby technologies used in that product and the total production volume for all products incorporating our technologies that are shipped by the system licensee 
integrated licensing model 
in addition to licensing under our two tier licensing model  we also license our technologies  as included in reference software code  to operating system vendors and independent software vendors isvs  and to certain other ce oems that act as combined implementation and system licensees 
these licensees incorporate our technologies in their software such as pc software dvd players used in desktop or notebook computers  in their mobile applications  or in ics they manufacture and incorporate into ce products 
as with the two tier licensing model  the combined implementation and system licensee pays us an initial administrative fee 
in exchange  the licensee receives a licensing package  which includes information on how to incorporate our technologies into the licensee s software program or integrated circuits 
once the product has been built  the licensee sends us a sample  or under certain circumstances self test results  for quality control evaluation 
if the sample is approved  the licensee is permitted to sell the product to retailers  distributors  and consumers  subject to the payment of royalties 
licensing of patent pools 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  via licensing corporation  we administer joint patent licensing programs  or patent pools  on behalf of third party patent owners 
some of the patent pools also include dolby patents 
these patent pools allow product oems streamlined access to certain essential patents to standardized technologies in the fields of audio coding  interactive television  digital radio  and wireless technologies 
products we design and manufacture video and audio products for the film production  cinema  and television broadcast industries 
distributed in over countries  these products are used in content creation  distribution  and playback to enhance image and sound quality  provide surround sound  and increase the efficiency of sound storage and distribution 
our product sales are derived from sales of our digital cinema servers  which load  store  decrypt  and decode encrypted digital film files for presentation on digital projectors in theaters  as well as from sales of digital d products and our professional reference monitor 
we also derive revenue from sales of our traditional cinema processors  which movie theaters use to process film soundtracks  and to a lesser extent  from sales of broadcast products used to encode and distribute content to viewers 
we offer related digital cinema processors and media adapters to decode digital cinema soundtracks  as well as digital cinema accessories that allow exhibitors to easily integrate our digital cinema servers with their existing automation systems 
digital cinema is based on open standards which  unlike standards for the traditional cinema market  do not include our proprietary audio technologies 
in fiscal   and our product revenue represented   and of our total revenue  respectively 
services we offer a variety of services to support film production  television broadcast  and music production 
our engineers work alongside filmmakers  television broadcasters  and music producers  helping them use our products and technologies to create and reproduce content as they envision 
we typically enter into service agreements with motion picture studios or filmmakers to provide production services related to the preparation of a dolby soundtrack  such as equipment calibration  mixing room alignment  and equalization 
under these agreements  we provide our encoders to the studios for use during sound mixing  enabling them to create films with dolby soundtracks using our proprietary technologies 
we provide other services such as print quality control  professional film mastering services to prepare movies for digital release  and theater system calibration for important screenings  such as premieres  film festivals  and press screenings 
our engineers also provide training  system design consultation  and on site technical expertise to cinema operators throughout the world to help them configure their screening rooms and equipment  in order to ensure that movies are replayed with consistently high quality

professional reference monitor professional reference monitor is a video monitor used during the production and post production of cinematic and video content in situations where grade reference performance is required 
industry standards certain of our technologies have been adopted as the explicit or de facto industry standard 
explicit industry standards are adopted through a formal negotiated standards process  whereby government entities  industry standards setting bodies  trade associations  and others evaluate and then prescribe or require the use of a technology 
we participate in a broad spectrum of organizations and industry standards bodies worldwide that establish explicit industry standards 
de facto industry standards are adopted by industry participants when technologies are introduced to the marketplace and become widely used 
sales and marketing we sell and market technologies  products  and services throughout the entertainment industry through an internal sales staff and through distributors 
we maintain sales offices in the us  the united kingdom  japan  china  taiwan  germany  france  spain  dubai  the netherlands  south korea  russia  and india 
we focus our marketing efforts on consumer electronics  personal computer  broadcast  cinema  production services  gaming  automotive  video  and mobile markets 
we reach these markets primarily through industry trade shows  public relations  our website  partner events  and direct marketing 

table of contents products and technology research and development historically  we have focused our research and development primarily on audio signal processing technologies 
increasingly  we have expanded our research and development efforts into new audio  voice  and video areas 
by focusing on creation  proof of feasibility  and early stage prototyping of patentable new audio  voice  image  and related technologies  our research groups serve as a source of new technologies for the engineering and technology development teams 
the research groups also help identify  investigate  and analyze new long term opportunities  help develop our technology strategy  and provide support for internally developed and externally acquired technologies 
engineering and technology development teams take the technologies developed by the research group to further develop for use in our professional products and by our licensees 
in addition  our engineering and technology development teams are involved in the commercialization of technologies created by third parties 
we conduct our research and development activities at a number of locations  including burbank  san francisco  and sunnyvale  california  yardley  pennsylvania  indianapolis  indiana  sydney  australia  stockholm  sweden  beijing  china  and nuremberg and berlin  germany  wroclaw  poland 
our research and development expenses were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
product manufacturing our product quality is enabled through the use of well established  and in some cases highly automated  assembly processes along with rigorous testing of our products 
we have a single production facility and we also use contract manufacturers for a significant portion of our production capacity 
we purchase components and fabricated parts from multiple suppliers  however  we rely on sole source suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our products 
we source components and fabricated parts both locally and globally in order to provide for continued supply 
customers we license our technologies to a broad range of customers  including software vendors  such as operating system vendors and isvs  ic manufacturers  and manufacturers of home audio and video products  set top boxes  video game consoles  mobile devices  in car entertainment systems  and pcs 
our customers operate in a wide range of entertainment industries  and we sell our professional products either directly to the end user or  more commonly  through dealers and distributors 
users of our professional products and services include movie studios  cinema operators  film distributors  broadcasters  and video game designers 
microsoft corporation is one of our licensees and accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
most of our microsoft revenue is generated from the windows operating system  which contains our technologies 
in may  we entered into an agreement with microsoft under which dolby digital plus channel decoding and dolby digital two channel encoding will be included in all pcs and tablets licensed to run the windows operating system 
under the arrangement  oems generally will be required to directly license and pay us a base royalty rate for the right to use the dolby technologies included in windows installed on the pcs and tablets they produce for online and file based content 
oems will be required to pay a higher per unit royalty for windows pcs that also include optical disc playback functionality  which will be implemented by isv applications 
this higher rate is consistent with rates paid historically for the inclusion of dolby disc playback software in the pc market 
in the near term  we expect the majority of pcs to continue to ship with optical disc drives and to include optical disc playback functionality 
additional information relating to microsoft and windows is set forth in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
competition the markets for entertainment industry technologies are highly competitive  and we face competitive threats and pricing pressure in our markets 
competitors for our licensed technologies include audyssey laboratories  dts  fraunhofer institute for integrated circuits  microsoft  monster cable products  philips  realnetworks  rovi  sony  thomson  and waves audio 
competitors for our products include barco  doremi  gdc  imax  masterimage d  nec  panavision  qsc audio products  qube cinema  real d  sony  technicolor  usl  and xpand 
competitors for our services include dts and sony 
in addition  other companies may become competitors in the future 
some of our current and future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we do  or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete 
for example  some of our current or potential competitors may have an advantage over us in the market for online technologies because of their 
table of contents greater experience in that market 
in addition  some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated system solutions in certain markets for entertainment technologies  including audio  video  and rights management technologies related to pcs or the internet  which could make competing technologies that we develop or acquire unnecessary 
by offering an integrated system solution  these potential competitors may also be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than we can  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we also face competitive risks in situations where our customers are current or potential competitors 
for example  sony and microsoft are significant licensee customers  and are also competitors with respect to some of our broadcast and consumer technologies 
many of the ce products that include our audio technologies also include audio technologies developed by our competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in each of our markets include some or all of the following inclusion in explicit industry standards  adoption as de facto industry standards  brand recognition and reputation  quality and reliability of products and services  technology performance  flexibility  and range of application  relationships with producers  directors  and distributors in the film industry  with television broadcast industry leaders  and with the management of semiconductor and consumer electronics oems  availability of compatible high quality audio content and the inclusion of dolby digital soundtracks on dvds  price  and timeliness and relevance of new product introductions 
we believe we compete favorably with respect to many of these factors 
in general  we are unable to quantify our market share in any particular market in which we operate 
our products and services span the audio portions of several distinct and diverse industries  including the cinema  broadcasting  video game  and recording industries 
the lack of clear definition of the markets in which our products  services  and technologies are sold or licensed  the basic nature of our technologies  which can be used for a variety of purposes  and the diverse nature of and lack of detailed reporting by our competitors make it impracticable to quantify our position 
intellectual property we have a substantial base of intellectual property assets  including patents  trademarks  copyrights  and trade secrets such as know how 
as of september   we had nearly  individual issued patents  and over  pending patent applications  in over jurisdictions throughout the world 
the currently issued patents are scheduled to expire at various times through november some of our patents relating to dolby digital technologies  from which we derive a significant part of our licensing revenue  have expired and others will expire over the next several years 
we have transitioned a number of our dolby digital licensees to dolby digital plus technologies  an extension of our dolby digital technologies  whose patents generally expire later than the dolby digital patents 
we are continuing to make progress in transitioning other dolby digital licensees to dolby digital plus 
we pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the us and various foreign countries where our customers manufacture  distribute  or sell licensed products 
we actively pursue new applications to expand our patent portfolio to address new technology innovations 
we have multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of our technologies 
we have over trademark registrations throughout the world for a variety of word marks  logos  and slogans 
our marks cover our various products  technologies  improvements  and features  as well as the services that we provide 
our trademarks are an integral part of our technology licensing program  and licensees typically elect to place our trademarks on their products to inform consumers that their products incorporate our technology and meet our quality specifications 
our trademarks include the following 
table of contents examples of our word trademarks dolby dolby digital dolby digital plus dolby home theater dolby mobile dolby headphone dolby truehd dolby digital cinema examples of our logo trademarks 
ggojpg 
we protect our intellectual property rights both domestically and internationally 
in the past  however  we have experienced problems with oems of ce products in emerging economies 
oems have failed to report or underreported shipments of their products that incorporate our technologies 
we have also had problems with implementation licensees selling ics with our technologies to third parties that are not system licensees 
we anticipate that such problems will continue to occur in the future 
moreover  we have relatively few or no issued patents in certain countries 
for example  in china  taiwan  and india  we have only limited patent protection  especially with respect to our dolby digital technologies 
in india  we have no issued patents for dolby digital technologies 
consequently  in the future we may recognize less revenue from dolby digital from those regions 
maintaining or growing our licensing revenue in developing countries such as china  taiwan  and india will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent rights in these counties  which is uncertain 
further  because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries  the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained  if any  is uncertain 
employees as of september   we had  employees worldwide  of which employees were based outside of the us none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our employee relations are good

risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we depend on the sale by our licensees of products that incorporate our technologies and any reduction in those sales would adversely affect our licensing revenue 
licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
we do not manufacture consumer entertainment products ourselves and we depend on licensees and customers  including software vendors and original equipment manufacturers oem  to incorporate our technologies into their products 
although we have license agreements with many of these companies  these agreements generally do not have minimum purchase commitments  are non exclusive  and do not generally require incorporation or use of our technologies 
accordingly  our revenue will decline if our licensees choose not to incorporate our technologies in their products  or if they sell fewer products incorporating our technologies  or if they otherwise face significant economic difficulties 
changes in consumer tastes or trends  rapidly evolving technology  competing products  changes in industry standards or adverse changes in business and economic conditions  among other things  may result in lower sales of products incorporating our technologies which would adversely affect our licensing revenue 
we also face the risk that our licensees retain product channel inventory levels that exceed future anticipated sales 
if such product sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by our licensees for any reason  these licensees may substantially decrease the number of technologies they license from us in subsequent periods 
to the extent that sales of pcs with dolby technologies decline  our licensing revenue will be adversely affected 
revenue from our pc market depends on several factors  including underlying pc unit shipment growth  the extent to which our technologies are included on computers  through operating systems  independent software vendors isv media applications  or otherwise  and the terms of any royalties or other payments we receive from licensors of such software 
we face many risks in the pc market that may affect our ability to successfully participate in that market  including  but not limited to the following purchasing trends away from traditional pcs and toward computing devices without optical disc drives  such as ultrabooks and tablets  which may not include our technologies  the availability and market appeal of pc software that includes our technologies on an unauthorized and infringing basis  for which we receive no royalty payments  and continued decreasing inclusion of isv media applications by pc oems in their windows based pcs  as windows already incorporates dvd playback software 
in may  we entered into an agreement with microsoft relating to the inclusion of dolby digital plus decoding and dolby digital consumer encoder in the windows operating system 
there are no assurances that we will derive as much licensing revenue under this model as we did under our prior licensing arrangements with microsoft 
the ultimate financial impact of these licensing arrangements for windows on our licensing revenue is subject to various risks  including the extent and rate at which windows is adopted in the marketplace  the extent to which oems include optical disc playback in windows devices  the extent to which earlier versions of microsoft operating systems  including windows  continue to be licensed after the release of windows  our ability to establish and extend licensing relationships directly with pc oems and isvs  the rate at which entertainment content shifts from optical disc media to online media  thus reducing the need for pcs to have optical disc drives and dvd and blu ray disc software players  and our ability to extend the adoption of our technologies to online and mobile platforms and devices 
any of these risks could adversely affect our licensing revenue 

table of contents general economic conditions may reduce our revenue and harm our business 
we continue to be cautious regarding future general economic conditions and their potential for suppressed consumer demand in the markets in which we license our technologies and sell our products 
our business could be affected by adverse changes in general economic conditions  because many of the products in which our technologies are incorporated are discretionary goods  such as pcs  digital televisions  set top boxes  dvd players and recorders  blu ray disc players  video game consoles  audio video receivers  mobile devices  in car entertainment systems  home theater in a box systems  camcorders  and portable media devices 
the global economic environment has adversely affected consumer confidence  disposable income  and spending 
while we cannot predict future general economic conditions  these conditions may persist or worsen 
furthermore  continued weakness in general economic conditions may result in a greater likelihood that more of our licensees and customers will become delinquent on their obligations to us or be unable to pay  which in turn could result in a higher level of write offs 
additionally  such economic conditions may result in increased underreporting and non reporting of royalty bearing revenue by our licensees as well as increased unauthorized use of our technologies  all of which would adversely affect our revenues 
our future success depends upon the growth of new and existing markets for our technologies and our ability to develop and adapt our technologies for those markets 
the future growth of our licensing revenue will depend  in part  upon the growth of  and our successful participation in  new and existing markets for our technologies  such as digital broadcast  online and mobile media distribution  consumer video and voice 
for example  growth of our broadcast revenue is dependent upon continued global growth of digital television broadcasting and the adoption of our technologies into emerging digital broadcast standards 
in addition  our revenue is dependent upon the growth of the pc market and the continued adoption of our technologies into pcs as well as the adoption of our technologies into connected portable devices such as tablets and smartphones 
furthermore  our ability to drive oem demand for our technologies depends in part on whether or not we are able to successfully participate in the online and mobile content delivery markets 
our ability to penetrate new and existing markets for our technologies depends on increased consumer demand for products that contain our technologies  which may not occur 
some of these markets are ones in which we have not previously participated or have limited experience  such as voice and consumer video  and we may not adequately adapt our business and our technologies to consumer demand 
if new and existing markets for our technologies do not develop or consumer demand for products that contain our technologies does not grow  our business and prospects would be materially adversely affected 
if we do not continue to develop and deliver innovative technologies in response to industry and technology changes  our business could decline 
the markets for our technologies and products are defined by rapid technological change  new and improved technology and product introductions  changing consumer and licensee demands  evolving industry standards  and technology and product obsolescence 
our future success depends on our ability to enhance our existing technologies and products and to develop acceptable new technologies and products that address the needs of the market in a timely manner 
the development of enhanced and new technologies and products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  highly skilled engineering and development personnel  and the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may not be able to identify  develop  acquire  market  or support new or enhanced technologies or products on a timely basis  if at all 
for example  while we view the continued advancements in online and mobile media content delivery as an area of opportunity  if we are not able to competitively address the needs of the changing online and mobile markets  our ability to generate revenue from those markets would be limited 
at times  such changes can be dramatic  such as the shift from vhs tapes to dvds for consumer playback of movies in homes and elsewhere

we face many risks in the d cinema market which may affect our ability to successfully participate in that market  including  but not limited to the following we face risks that our customers maintain excess product inventory levels which could reduce future anticipated sales  at least one of our competitors has exclusive licensing arrangements for d products with theater exhibitors  which has in the past and we expect will in the future restrict our ability to compete in the d market  the d market has become increasingly competitive and we may lose further market share  with the industry transition to d enabled screens substantially complete  demand for new d enabled screens has dropped significantly and the industry has entered into a replacement cycle  industry participants may perceive our up front d equipment costs and reusable glasses business model or our d products as less attractive  our participation in the d cinema market will be limited to the extent theaters do not convert from analog to digital cinema  demand for our d cinema products is driven by the number of d cinema releases and the commercial success of those releases  our d glasses could become subject to regulation in the us and other countries in the future  which could restrict how our d glasses are manufactured  used  or marketed  and there has been increased public scrutiny of potential health risks relating to viewing d movies 
if these potential health risks are substantiated  the popularity of d movies could decline 
in addition  if health risks associated with our d products materialize  we may become subject to government regulation or product liability claims  including personal injury claims 
if we are unable to manage these risks effectively  our ability to compete profitably in the d cinema market may be adversely affected 
events and conditions in the cinema and broadcast industries may affect sales of our cinema products and other services 
sales of our cinema products and services tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the cinema industry 
for example  when box office receipts for the cinema industry increase  we have typically seen a corresponding increase in sales of our cinema products  as cinema owners will be more likely to build new theaters and upgrade existing theaters with our more advanced products 
conversely  when box office receipts are down  cinema owners tend to scale back on plans to expand or upgrade their systems 
our cinema product sales are also subject to fluctuations based on events and conditions in the cinema industry generally that may or may not be tied to box office receipts in particular time periods 
for example  the growth in piracy of motion pictures adversely affects the construction of new screens  the renovation of existing theaters  and the continued production of new motion pictures 
our services revenue  both in the us and internationally  is tied to the number of movies being produced and distributed by studios and independent filmmakers 
a number of factors can affect the number of movies that are produced  including strikes and work stoppages within the cinema industry  as well as tax incentive arrangements provided by many governments to promote local filmmaking 
services revenue is also impacted by the transition to digital cinema in some regions 
for example  the decrease in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was attributable primarily to a decrease in film based production services revenue as the cinema industry transitions to digital cinema as well as decrease in virtual print fees  which were generated from certain leased digital cinema assets  as we discontinued this program in fiscal the demand for our cinema products and services could decline as the cinema industry adopts digital cinema 
as cinema exhibitors have constructed new theaters or upgraded existing theaters  they have generally chosen digital cinema over traditional film cinema and we expect this trend to continue 
digital cinema  which is based on open standards  does not include our proprietary audio technologies 
as the cinema industry continues to adopt digital cinema  the demand for our traditional film cinema products and services has declined significantly and we anticipate that the demand for film based products will decline in future periods 
furthermore  exhibitors adopting digital cinema can choose from multiple digital cinema playback servers and audio processors  many of which may not contain our technologies  and our competitive position in the digital cinema market is not as strong as our position in the traditional film cinema market 
decreases in demand for our 
table of contents traditional film cinema products and services accompanied by decreases in revenue from digital cinema products and services would adversely affect our revenue stream from the cinema industry 
a decrease in demand for our cinema products and services could adversely affect our consumer products licensing business 
a decrease in the demand for our cinema products and services could adversely affect licensing of our consumer technologies  because the strength of our brand and our ability to use professional product developments to introduce new technologies  which can later be licensed to oems and service providers  would be impaired 
if  in such circumstances  we are unable to adapt our products and services or introduce new products for the digital cinema market successfully  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we face risks relating to the online and mobile content delivery markets and declines in optical disc media 
for nearly years  movies have been distributed  purchased  and consumed through optical disc media  such as dvd and more recently blu ray disc 
however  the growth of the internet and home computer usage  connected televisions  set top boxes  tablets  smartphones  and other devices accompanied by the rapid advancement of online and mobile content delivery has resulted in the recent trend to movie download and streaming services in various parts of the world 
we expect a further shift away from optical disc media to online and mobile media content consumption  which will result in declines in revenue from dvd and blu ray disc players 
such declines would adversely affect our licensing revenue 
in addition  online and mobile media content services that compete with or replace dvd and blu ray disc players as dominant media for consumer video entertainment may choose not to encode their content with our proprietary technologies  which could affect oem and software vendor demand for our decoding technologies 
furthermore  our participation in online media content playback may be less profitable for us than dvd and blu ray disc players 
the online and mobile markets are characterized by intense competition  evolving industry standards and business and distribution models  disruptive software and hardware technology developments  frequent new product and service introductions  short product and service life cycles  and price sensitivity on the part of consumers  all of which may result in downward pressure on pricing 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate depending upon the timing of when we receive royalty reports from our licensees  royalty report adjustments  and the satisfaction of our revenue recognition criteria 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate based on the risks set forth in this section  as well as on the timing of when we receive royalty reports from our licensees and when we have met all revenue recognition criteria  royalty reports including positive or negative corrective adjustments  retroactive royalties that cover extended periods of time  the recognition of unusually large amounts of licensing revenue from licensees in any given quarter because not all of our revenue recognition criteria were met in prior periods  and the recognition of large amounts of products and services revenue in any given quarter because not all of our revenue recognition criteria were met in prior periods 
this can result in the recognition of a large amount of revenue in a given quarter that is not necessarily indicative of the amounts of revenue to be received in future quarters  thus causing fluctuations in our operating results 
inaccurate licensee royalty reporting could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we generate licensing revenue primarily from oems and software vendors who license our technologies and incorporate those technologies in their products 
our license agreements generally obligate our licensees to pay us a specified royalty for every product they ship that incorporates our technologies  and we rely on our licensees to accurately report their shipments 
however  we have difficulty independently determining whether or not our licensees are reporting shipments accurately  particularly with respect to software incorporating our technologies because unauthorized copies of such software can be made relatively easily 
most of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees records  but audits are generally expensive  time consuming  and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our licensees 
in the past  licensees  particularly in emerging economies  such as china  have understated or failed to report the number of products incorporating our technologies that they shipped  and we have not been able to collect and recognize revenue to which we were entitled 
we expect that we will continue to experience understatement and non reporting of royalties by our 
table of contents licensees  which could adversely affect our operating results 
conversely  to the extent that our licensees overstate the number of products incorporating our technologies  or report the products under the wrong categories  corrections of prior reports could result in reductions of royalty revenue in subsequent periods  which could also adversely affect our operating results 
third parties from whom we license technologies may challenge our calculation of the royalties we owe them for inclusion of their technologies in our products and licensed technologies  which could adversely affect our operating results  business  and prospects 
in some cases  the products we sell and the technologies we license to our customers include intellectual property that we have licensed from third parties 
our agreements with these third parties generally require us to pay them royalties for that use  and give the third parties the right to audit our calculation of those royalties 
a third party may disagree with our interpretation of the terms of a license agreement or  as a result of an audit  a third party could challenge the accuracy of our calculation 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  involved in disputes with third party technology licensors regarding license terms 
a successful challenge by a third party could result in the termination of a license agreement or increase the amount of royalties we have to pay to the third party  which would decrease our gross margin and adversely affect our operating results 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property could materially adversely affect our operating results 
we have often experienced  and expect to continue to experience  problems with non licensee oems and software vendors  particularly in emerging economies  such as china  incorporating our technologies and trademarks into their products without our authorization and without paying us any licensing fees 
manufacturers of integrated circuits  or ics  containing our technologies occasionally sell these ics to third parties who are not our system licensees 
these sales  and the failure of such manufacturers to report the sales  facilitate the unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
as emerging economies transition from analog to digital content  such as the transition from analog to digital broadcast  we expect to experience increased problems with this form of piracy  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have limited experience in non sound technology markets which could limit our future growth 
our future growth will depend  in part  upon our expansion into areas beyond sound technologies 
for example  in addition to our digital cinema and d digital cinema initiatives  we are exploring other areas that facilitate delivery of digital entertainment  such as video solutions for the consumer market 
we will need to spend considerable resources in the future on research and development or acquisitions in order to deliver innovative non sound products and technologies 
however  we have limited experience in non sound technology markets and  despite our efforts  non sound products  technologies  and services we expect to develop or acquire and market may not achieve or sustain market acceptance  may not meet industry needs  and may not be accepted as industry standards 
if we are unsuccessful in selling non sound products  technologies  and services  the future growth of our business may be limited 
if our products and technologies are not adopted as industry standards  our business prospects could be limited and our operating results could be adversely affected 
the entertainment industry depends upon industry standards to ensure compatibility across delivery platforms and a wide variety of consumer entertainment products 
accordingly  we make significant efforts to design our products and technologies to address capability  quality  and cost considerations so that they either meet  or  more importantly  are adopted as  industry standards across the broad range of entertainment industry markets in which we participate  as well as the markets in which we hope to compete in the future 
to have our products and technologies adopted as industry standards  we must convince a broad spectrum of standards setting organizations throughout the world  as well as our major customers and licensees who are members of such organizations  to adopt them as such and to ensure that other industry standards are consistent with our products and technologies 
if our technologies are not adopted or do not remain as industry standards  our business  operating results  and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  the market for broadcast technologies has traditionally been heavily based on industry standards  often set by governments or other standards setting organizations  and we expect this to be the case in the future 
if our technologies are not chosen as industry standards for broadcasting in particular geographic areas  this could adversely affect our ability to compete in these markets 
it may be more difficult for us  in the future  to have our technologies adopted as individual industry standards to the extent that entertainment industry participants collaborate on the development of industry standard technologies 
standards setting organizations are increasingly adopting or establishing technology standards for use in a wide range of consumer entertainment products 
as a result  it is more difficult for individual companies to have their technologies adopted 
table of contents wholesale as an informal industry standard 
we call this type of standard a de facto industry standard  meaning that the industry has widely adopted the technology  although no industry standards setting organization has explicitly mandated such standard 
increasingly there are multiple companies  including ones that typically compete against one another  involved in the development of new technologies for use in entertainment oriented products 
as a result  these companies often license their collective intellectual property rights as a group  making it more difficult for any single company to have its technologies adopted widely as a de facto industry standard or to have its technologies adopted as an exclusive  explicit industry standard for consumer entertainment products 
even if our technologies are adopted as an explicit industry standard for a particular market  market participants may not widely adopt our technologies 
even when a standards setting organization mandates our technologies for a particular market  which we call an explicit industry standard  our technologies may not be the sole technologies adopted for that market as an explicit industry standard 
accordingly  our operating results depend upon participants in that market choosing to adopt our technologies instead of competitive technologies that also may be acceptable under such standard 
for example  the continued growth of our revenue from the broadcast market will depend upon both the continued global adoption of digital television generally and the choice to use our technologies where it is one of several accepted industry standards 
our licensing revenue depends to a significant extent on patent royalties  and some of our key patents from which a significant portion of that revenue is derived have expired and will continue to expire 
many of the technologies that we license to our system licensees are covered by patents  and the licensing revenue that we receive from those licenses depends in large part upon the life of such patents 
in general  our agreements with our licensees require them to pay us a full royalty with respect to a particular technology only until the last patent covering that technology expires in a particular country 
as of september   we had nearly  individual issued patents  and over  pending patent applications  in over jurisdictions throughout the world 
the currently issued patents expire at various times through november we regularly look for opportunities to expand our patent portfolio both through organic development and acquisitions 
however  to the extent that we are not able to obtain new patents or develop other proprietary technologies  or to the extent that we do not replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents with licensing revenue based on non expiring patents and other proprietary technologies  our operating results may be materially adversely affected 
in particular  some of our patents relating to dolby digital technologies  from which we derive a significant part of our licensing revenue  have expired and others will expire over the next several years 
we have transitioned a number of our dolby digital licensees  and continue to make progress in transitioning other dolby digital licensees  to dolby digital plus technologies  an extension of our dolby digital technologies  whose patents generally expire later than the dolby digital patents 
we now derive a significant part of our licensing revenue from dolby digital plus 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in having licensees continue to transition to dolby digital plus  or to the extent that licensees of dolby digital plus transition back to dolby digital as our original patents covering this technology expire  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the markets for our technologies are highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
the markets for entertainment industry technologies are highly competitive  and we face competitive threats and pricing pressure in our markets 
competitors for our licensed technologies include audyssey laboratories  dts  fraunhofer institute for integrated circuits  microsoft  monster cable products  philips  realnetworks  sony  technicolor  and waves audio 
competitors for our products include barco  doremi  gdc  imax  masterimage d  nec  panavision  qsc audio products  qube cinema  reald  rovi  sony  technicolor  usl  and xpand 
competitors for our services include dts and sony 
consumers may perceive the quality of the audio experience produced by some of our competitors technologies to be equivalent or superior to the audio experience produced by our technologies 
other companies may become competitors in one or more of these areas in the future 
additionally  some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources than we do  or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete  particularly in the market for online media content 
these competitors may also be able to offer integrated system solutions in markets for sound or non sound entertainment technologies on a royalty free basis or at a lower price than our technologies  including audio  video  and rights management technologies related to pcs or the internet  which could make competing technologies that we develop unnecessary 

table of contents our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brand  and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brand  our business will be materially harmed 
maintaining and strengthening the dolby brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our licensing  products  and services business  as well as to our ability to enter new markets for our sound and other technologies 
our continued success depends  in part  on our reputation for providing high quality technologies  products  and services across a wide range of entertainment markets  including the ce  pc  broadcast  and gaming markets 
if we fail to promote and maintain the dolby brand successfully in licensing  products or services  our business and prospects will suffer 
furthermore  we believe that the strength of our brand may affect the likelihood that our technologies are adopted as industry standards in various markets and for various applications 
our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on our ability to develop innovative technologies for the entertainment industry  to successfully enter into new markets  and to provide high quality products and services in these new markets  which we may not do successfully 
our licensing of industry standard technologies can be subject to restrictions that could adversely affect our business and prospects 
when a standards setting organization mandates our technologies as explicit industry standards  we generally must agree to license such technologies on a fair  reasonable  and non discriminatory basis  which could limit our control over the use of these technologies 
in these situations  we must often limit the royalty rates we charge for these technologies  which could adversely affect our revenue 
furthermore  we may be unable to limit to whom we license such technologies  and may be unable to restrict many terms of the license 
we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims that our licensing of industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards setting organization 
allegations such as these could be asserted in private actions seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief  or in regulatory actions 
claimants in such cases could seek to restrict or change our licensing practices or our ability to license our technologies in ways that could injure our reputation and otherwise materially and adversely affect our business  operating results  and prospects 
we face risks in conducting business in china and other emerging economies 
we believe that various trends will increase our exposure to the risks of conducting business in emerging economies 
for example  we expect the number of oems in emerging economies  such as china  to increase due to the availability of lower manufacturing costs as compared to those of other industrial countries and the continued industry shift by retailers towards lower end dvd and more recently blu ray disc player and television offerings 
we have seen oems shift product manufacturing to these lower cost manufacturing countries and expect more oems to do so in the future 
we also believe that our sales of products and services in emerging economies will expand in the future to the extent that the use of digital surround sound technologies increases in these countries  including in movies and broadcast television  and as consumers there become more affluent 
we face many risks associated with operating in these emerging economies  in large part due to limited recognition and enforcement of contractual and intellectual property rights 
as a result  we may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights in these emerging economies  where intellectual property rights are not as respected as they are in the us  japan  and europe 
we believe that it is critical that we strengthen existing relationships and develop new relationships with entertainment industry participants worldwide to increase our ability to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights without relying solely on the legal systems in the countries in which we operate 
if we are unable to develop  maintain  and strengthen these relationships  our revenue from these countries could be adversely affected 
we have limited or no patent protection for some of our technologies in particular countries  including china  taiwan  and india  which could limit our ability to grow our business in these markets 
in china and taiwan we have only limited patent protection  especially with respect to our dolby digital technologies 
in india  we have no issued patents for dolby digital technologies 
consequently  maintaining or growing our licensing revenue will depend on our ability to obtain patent rights in these countries for existing and new technologies  which is uncertain 
furthermore  because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries  the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained  if any  is likewise uncertain 
our licensing revenue depends in large part upon semiconductor manufacturers incorporating our technologies into integrated circuits 
our licensing revenue from system licensees depends in large part upon the availability of ics that implement our technologies 
ic manufacturers incorporate our technologies into these ics  which are then incorporated in consumer entertainment products 
we do not manufacture these ics  but rather depend on ic manufacturers to develop  produce  and then sell them to system licensees 
we do not control the ic manufacturers decisions whether or not to incorporate our technologies 
table of contents into their ics  and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts nor predict their success 
as a result  if these ic manufacturers are unable or unwilling  for any reason  to implement our technologies into their ics  or if  for any reason  they sell fewer ics incorporating our technologies  our operating results will be adversely affected 
pricing pressures on the system licensees who incorporate our technologies into their products could limit the licensing fees we charge for our technologies  which could adversely affect our revenue 
the markets for the consumer entertainment products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive 
we expect to face increased royalty pricing pressure for our technologies as we seek to drive the adoption of our technologies into online content and portable devices  such as tablets and smartphones 
retail prices for consumer entertainment products that include our sound technologies  such as dvd players and home theater systems  have decreased significantly  and we expect prices to decrease for the foreseeable future 
in response  oems have sought to reduce their product costs  which can result in downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge our customers who incorporate our technologies into the consumer entertainment products that they sell 
furthermore  while we have contractual rights with many of our licensees for cost of living adjustments to our royalty rights  we may not be able to negotiate those terms in our contracts with existing and new licensees 
additionally  downward cost of living adjustments would result in declines in the licensing fees that we charge 
a decline in  or the modification or loss of the contractual right to increase  the licensing fees we charge could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we have in the past  and may in the future be  subject to legal claims related to our intellectual property rights  which are costly to defend  could require us to pay damages  and could limit our ability to use particular technologies in the future 
companies in the technology and entertainment industries own large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks  and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
we have faced such claims in the past and we expect to face similar claims in the future 
any intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  expensive to litigate or settle  and could divert management resources and attention 
in the past we have settled claims relating to infringement allegations and agreed to make payments in connection with such settlements 
we expect that similar claims will be asserted against us in the future in the ordinary course of our business 
an adverse determination in any intellectual property claim could require that we pay damages or stop using technologies found to be in violation of a third party s rights and could prevent us from offering our products and services to others 
in order to avoid these restrictions  we may have to seek a license for the technology  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any license could also require us to pay significant royalties  and may significantly increase our operating expenses 
as a result  we may be required to develop alternative non infringing technologies  which could require significant effort and expense 
if we cannot license or develop technologies for any aspects of our business found to be infringing  we may be forced to limit our product and service offerings and may be unable to compete effectively 
in some instances  we have contractually agreed to provide indemnifications to licensees relating to our intellectual property 
additionally  at times in the past  we have chosen to defend our licensees from third party intellectual property infringement claims even where such defense was not contractually required  and we may choose to take on such defense in the future 
any of these results could harm our brand  our operating results  and our financial condition 
we have in the past and may in the future have disputes with our licensees regarding our licensing arrangements 
at times  we are engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our intellectual property rights  including matters related to our royalty rates and other terms of our licensing arrangements 
these types of disputes can be asserted by our customers or prospective customers or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief  or in regulatory actions 
in the past  licensees have threatened to initiate litigation against us regarding our licensing royalty rate practices including our adherence to licensing on fair  reasonable  and non discriminatory terms and potential antitrust claims 
damages and requests for injunctive relief asserted in claims like these could be material  and could be disruptive to our business 
any disputes with our customers or potential customers or other third parties could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and prospects 
we face risks relating to the transition to digital cinema 
we face a number of risks relating to the transition to digital cinema  including exhibitors may perceive competing products to be potentially advantageous to our products or they may choose lower priced competing products or competing products with different features  such as support for high frame rate content or k presentation  
table of contents at least one of our competitors has a significantly greater installed base of its digital cinema servers than we do which has and likely will continue to limit our share of the digital cinema market  particularly in the us market  pricing and other competitive pressures have caused us to implement pricing strategies which have had an adverse effect on our products gross margins  as the industry transition to digital cinema becomes substantially complete  the demand for new digital cinema screens will drop significantly and the industry will enter into a replacement cycle 
these and other risks related to digital cinema could limit our future prospects in digital cinema and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
acquisition activities could result in operating difficulties and other harmful consequences 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of possible strategic transactions  including acquisitions 
we consider these types of transactions in connection with our efforts to expand our business beyond sound technologies 
although we cannot predict whether or not we will complete any such acquisition or other transactions in the future  any of these transactions could be material in relation to our market capitalization  financial condition  or results of operations 
the process of integrating an acquired company  business  or technology may create unforeseen difficulties and expenditures 
foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above  including those related to integration of operations across different geographies  cultures  and languages  currency risks  and risks associated with the particular economic  political  and regulatory environment in specific countries 
also  the anticipated benefit of our acquisitions may not materialize 
we face various risks in integrating acquired businesses  including diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges  cultural and logistical challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization  retaining employees  suppliers and customers from businesses we acquire  the need to implement or improve internal controls  procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls  procedures and policies  possible write offs or impairment charges resulting from acquisitions  unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to acquired businesses  and the need to integrate acquired businesses accounting  management information  manufacturing  human resources  and other administrative systems to permit effective management 
furthermore  acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations  including a potential adverse impact on our gross margins 
future acquisitions could result in dilutive equity issuances or the need to obtain equity or debt financing on unfavorable terms 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities  amortization expenses  and write offs of goodwill  any of which could harm our operating results or financial condition 
future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
we are dependent upon our relationships within the entertainment industry  and the failure to maintain such relationships could materially harm our business 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with a broad range of entertainment industry participants  including film studios  broadcasters  video game designers  music producers  mobile media content producers  and oems  our business and prospects could be materially harmed 
relationships have historically played an important role in the entertainment markets that we serve 
for example  sales of our products and services are particularly dependent upon our relationships with the major film studios and broadcasters  and licensing of our technologies is particularly dependent upon our relationships with system licensees  software vendors  and ic manufacturers 
if we fail to maintain and strengthen these relationships  these entertainment industry participants may be less likely to purchase and use our technologies  products  and services  or create content incorporating our technologies  which could materially harm our business and prospects 
additionally  if major 
table of contents entertainment industry participants form strategic relationships that exclude us  whether in licensing  products  or services  our business and prospects could be materially adversely affected 
we face diverse risks in our international business  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
for fiscal   and  revenue from outside the us was   and of our total revenue  respectively 
we expect that international and export sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
this future revenue will depend to a large extent on the continued use and expansion of our technologies in entertainment industries worldwide 
due to our reliance on sales to customers outside the us  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights  especially in those foreign countries that do not recognize and enforce intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the us  japan  and european countries  which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our technologies  us and foreign government trade restrictions  including those which may impose restrictions on importation of programming  technology  or components to or from the us  our ability to comply with applicable international laws and regulations governing our business and operations  including local consumer and safety laws  as well as license requirements  foreign government taxes  regulations  and permit requirements  including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the us  and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the us  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  difficulty in establishing  staffing  and managing foreign operations  adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake  political or social instability  natural disasters  war or events of terrorism  and the strength of international economies 
some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 
even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of conducting business internationally  our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 
in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act and us export controls 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and us export controls  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  distributors  dealers  and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or these regulations 
any such violation could have an adverse effect on our business 
we face risks associated with complying with international employment laws 
a significant number of our employees are located outside the us this means that we have exposure to changes in foreign laws governing our relationships with our employees  which could have a direct impact on our operating costs 
expansion into international markets has required  and will require  significant management attention and resources 
we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local employment laws and regulations  which may be substantially different from those in the us revisions to patent laws and regulations in the us and abroad may adversely impact our ability to obtain  license  and enforce our patent rights 
our licensing business depends in part on the uniform and consistent treatment of patent rights in the us and abroad 
changes to the patent laws and regulations in the us and abroad may limit our ability to obtain  license  and enforce our rights 
additionally  court and administrative rulings may interpret existing patent laws and regulations in ways that adversely affect our ability to obtain  license  and enforce our patents 
for example  recent rulings by the us supreme court concerning injunctions may make it more difficult  under some circumstances  for us to obtain injunctive relief against a party that has been 
table of contents found to infringe one or more of our patents  and rulings regarding patent challenges by licensees could potentially make it easier for our licensees to challenge our patents even though they have already agreed to take a license 
our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time  which may result in a decrease in our stock price 
our stock repurchase program  whereby we may continue to repurchase shares of our class a common stock  may reduce the public float of shares available for trading on a daily basis 
such purchases may be limited  suspended  or terminated at any time without prior notice 
there can be no assurance that we will buy additional shares of our class a common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or earnings per share 
important factors that could cause us to discontinue or decrease our share repurchases include  among others  unfavorable market conditions  the market price of our class a common stock  the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time  the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs  our ability to make appropriate  timely  and beneficial decisions as to when  how  and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program  and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing stock 
if we curtail our repurchase program  our stock price may be negatively affected 
fluctuations in our operating results and other factors may contribute to the volatility of the market price of our stock 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results 
these fluctuations may make financial planning and forecasting more difficult 
in addition  these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash  which could negatively impact our business and prospects  and could increase the volatility of our stock price 
factors that may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and revenue or the volatility of the market price of our stock include those risks set forth in this section as well as the following fluctuations in demand for our products and for the digital entertainment products of our licensees  adverse developments in general economic conditions  the amount and timing of our operating costs  capital expenditures  and related charges  including those related to the expansion or consolidation of our business  operations  and infrastructure  changes in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products and services or the markets for consumer entertainment products incorporating our technologies  fluctuations in the timing of royalty reports we receive from our licensees  including late or sporadic reports  variations in the time to market of our technologies in the entertainment industry markets in which we operate  corrections to licensees reports received in periods subsequent to those in which the original revenue was reported  the announcement  introduction  or enhancement of technologies  products  and services  by us  our licensees  and our competitors  and market acceptance of these new or enhanced technologies  products  and services  rapid  wholesale changes in technology in the entertainment industries in which we compete  events and conditions in the cinema industry  including box office receipts that affect the number of theaters constructed  the number of movies produced and exhibited  the general popularity of motion pictures  and strikes by cinema industry participants  the financial resources of cinema exhibitors available to buy our products or to equip their theaters to accommodate upgraded or new technologies  consolidation by participants in the markets in which we compete  which could result among other things in pricing pressure  seasonal electronics product shipment patterns by our system licensees  particularly in our first fiscal quarter  which generally result in revenue in our second fiscal quarter  the impact of  and our ability to react to  interruptions in the entertainment distribution process  including as a result of work stoppages at our facilities  our customers facilities  and other points throughout the entertainment distribution process  adverse outcomes of litigation or governmental proceedings  including any foreign  federal  state  or local tax assessments or audits  
table of contents repurchases we make of our common stock  costs of litigation and intellectual property protection  exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and other currencies  variations between our operating results and published analysts expectations  and announcements by our competitors or significant customers 
one or more of the foregoing or other factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately higher or lower or may cause our revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly in any particular quarterly or annual period 
consequently  results from prior periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods 
changes in tax rates and exposure for additional income tax liabilities or adverse outcomes resulting from examinations of our tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  the geographic mix of our revenue  or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation could all favorably or unfavorably affect our future effective tax rates 
we file income tax returns in the us and in several us state and foreign jurisdictions  and must use judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
for example  the following could adversely affect our income taxes earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  expiration of or lapses in the r d tax credit laws  fluctuations in tax exempt interest income  transfer pricing adjustments  tax effects of nondeductible compensation  tax costs related to intercompany realignments  changes in accounting principles  or changes in tax laws and regulations  including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income  or the foreign tax credit rules 
we are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that estimates of our tax liability and the likelihood that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if our operating results do not meet or exceed their projections  our stock price could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us or our industry downgrade our stock or the stock of other companies in our industry  or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or industry  or if our operating results do not meet or exceed their projections  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our products  services  and brand 
our business is dependent upon protecting our patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and other intellectual property rights 
licensing revenue represented   and of our total revenue in the fiscal years   and  respectively 
effective intellectual property rights protection  however  may not be available under the laws of every country in which our products and services and those of our licensees are distributed 
also  the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective 
any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could 
table of contents harm our business or our ability to compete 
in addition  protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming 
we have taken steps in the past to enforce our intellectual property rights and expect to do so in the future 
however  it may not be practicable or cost effective for us to enforce our intellectual property rights fully  particularly in some countries or where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships 
if we are unable to successfully identify and stop unauthorized use of our intellectual property  we could experience increased operational and enforcement costs  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we generally seek patent protection for our innovations 
however  it is possible that some of these innovations may not be protectable  or we may choose not to protect particular innovations that later turn out to be important  due to the high costs of obtaining patent protection 
even where we do have patent protection  the scope of such protection may be insufficient to prevent third parties from designing around our particular patent claims 
furthermore  there is always the possibility that an issued patent may later be found to be invalid or unenforceable 
we also seek to maintain select intellectual property as trade secrets 
third parties or our employees could intentionally or accidentally compromise the intellectual property that we maintain as trade secrets  which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from them 
our customers who are also our current or potential competitors may choose to use their own or competing technologies rather than ours 
we face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors 
for example  sony and microsoft are significant licensee customers and sony is a significant purchaser of our broadcast products and services  but sony and microsoft are also competitors with respect to some of our consumer  broadcast  and cinema technologies 
to the extent that our customers choose to use competing technologies they have developed or in which they have an interest  rather than use our technologies  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we face competition from other audio formats 
we believe that the success we have had licensing our surround sound technologies to system licensees is due  in part  to the strength of our brand and the perception that our technologies provide a high quality solution for surround sound 
however  both free and proprietary sound technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent  and we expect competitors to continue to enter this field with other solutions 
furthermore  to the extent that customers perceive our competitors solutions to provide the same advantages as our technologies at a lower or comparable price  there is a risk that these customers may treat sound encoding technologies such as ours as commodities  resulting in loss of status of our technologies  decline in their use  and significant pricing pressure 
the commoditization of our audio technologies  as opposed to treatment as a premium solution  could adversely affect our business  operating results  and prospects 
the loss of or delay in operations of one or more of our key suppliers could materially delay or stop the production of our products and impair our ability to generate revenue 
our reliance on outside suppliers for some of the key materials and components we use in manufacturing our products involves risks  including limited control over the price  timely delivery  and quality of such components 
we have no formal agreements in place with our suppliers for the continued supply of materials and components 
although we have identified alternate suppliers for most of our key materials and components  any required changes in our suppliers could cause material delays in our production operations and increase our production costs 
in addition  at times our suppliers have not been  and in the future may not be  able to meet our production demands as to volume  quality  or timeliness 
moreover  we rely on sole source suppliers for some of the components that we use to manufacture our products  including specific charged coupled devices  light emitting diodes  and digital signal processors 
these sole source suppliers may become unable or unwilling to deliver these components to us at an acceptable cost or at all  which could force us to redesign those specific products 
our inability to obtain timely delivery of key components of acceptable quality  any significant increases in the prices of components  or the redesign of our products could result in material production delays  increased costs  and reductions in shipments of our products  any of which could increase our operating costs  harm our customer relationships  or materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
revenue from our products may suffer if our production processes encounter problems or if we are not able to match our production capacity to fluctuating levels of demand 
our products are highly complex and production difficulties or inefficiencies can interrupt production  resulting in our inability to deliver products on time in a cost effective manner  which could harm our competitive position 
we have a single 
table of contents production facility and increasingly use contract manufacturers for a significant portion of our production capacity 
our reliance on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products involves risks  including limited control over timely delivery and quality of such products 
if production of our products is interrupted  we may not be able to manufacture products on a timely basis 
a shortage of manufacturing capacity for our products could adversely affect our operating results and damage our customer relationships 
we are unable to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity to rapidly changing market conditions and a contract manufacturer may encounter similar difficulties 
likewise  we may be unable to quickly respond to fluctuations in customer demand or contract manufacturer interruptions 
at times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for some of our products 
any inability to effectively respond to fluctuations in customer demand for our products or contract manufacturer interruptions may adversely affect our gross margins 
our products  from time to time  experience quality problems that can result in decreased sales and higher operating expenses 
our products are complex and sometimes contain undetected software or hardware errors  particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released 
in addition  to the extent that we engage contract manufacturers  we do not have as much control over manufacturing which could result in quality problems 
furthermore  our products are sometimes combined with or incorporated into products from other vendors  sometimes making it difficult to identify the source of a problem 
these errors could result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or cause delays in delivering them and meeting customer demands  any of which could reduce our revenue and raise significant customer relations issues 
in addition  if our products contain errors we could be required to replace or reengineer them  which would increase our costs 
moreover  if any such errors cause unintended consequences  we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims 
although we generally attempt to contractually limit liability for defective products to the cost of repairing or replacing these products  if these contract provisions are not enforced  or are unenforceable for any reason  or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited  we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims 
licensee products that incorporate our technologies  from time to time  experience quality problems that could damage our brand  decrease revenue  and increase operating expenses 
newly introduced and new versions of licensee products that incorporate our technologies are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors 
in addition  the combination or incorporation of these newly introduced products with products from other companies can make it difficult to identify the source of a problem 
any negative publicity or negative impact relating to these product problems could adversely affect the perception of our brand 
in addition  these errors could result in loss of  or delay in  market acceptance of those products or dolby technologies  or cause delays in delivering them and meeting customer demands  any of which could reduce our revenue and raise significant customer relations issues 
although we generally attempt to contractually limit our liability for our licensees defective products  we may elect to help reengineer those products  which could adversely affect our operating results 
a loss of one or more of our key customers or licensees in any of our markets could adversely affect our operating results 
from time to time  one or a small number of our customers or licensees may represent a significant percentage of our products  services  or licensing revenue 
for example  revenue from our largest customer represented approximately of total revenue for fiscal although we have agreements with many of these customers  these agreements typically do not require any minimum purchases or minimum royalty fees and do not prohibit customers from purchasing products and services from competitors 
a decision by any of our major customers or licensees not to use our technologies  or their failure or inability to pay amounts owed to us in a timely manner  or at all  whether due to strategic redirections or adverse changes in their businesses or for other reasons  could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and may adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal  state  local  and international laws governing the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management  disposal  and labeling of hazardous substances and wastes  and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
we could incur costs  fines  and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims  or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs  if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws 
liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to comparative fault 
the ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict 

table of contents new environmental laws and regulations could impact our operating results 
we expect that new environmental laws and regulations  introduced on an ongoing basis  will have the potential to affect our manufacturing and licensing operations 
although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws and regulations  they will likely result in additional costs or decreased revenue  and could require that we redesign or change how we manufacture our products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we could incur substantial costs due to regulations regarding the composition of our products  which may adversely affect our business  operating results  and financial condition 
we face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products 
for example  we redesigned our products to comply with restrictions on lead and other hazardous substances so we could continue to offer them for sale within the european union 
for some products  substituting particular components containing regulated hazardous substances is more difficult or costly  and additional redesign efforts could result in production delays 
selected electronic products that we maintain in inventory may be rendered obsolete if not in compliance with the new environmental laws  which could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from those products 
continued global credit market weakness could negatively impact the value and liquidity of our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities  including money market funds  us treasury and agency securities  municipal debt securities  corporate bonds  and commercial paper 
although we follow an established investment policy and seek to minimize the credit risk associated with investments  these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  and interest rate risks 
any downgrades  losses  or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents  or investments could negatively impact our investments or our ability to meet our investment objectives 
such negative impact  should it arise  could require an impairment charge  which would adversely impact our financial results 
we face risks associated with international trade and currency exchange 
we maintain sales  marketing  and business operations in foreign countries 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates associated with the local currencies of our foreign business operations 
while we derive nearly all of our revenue from transactions denominated in us dollars  nearly all of our costs from our foreign operations are denominated in the currency of that foreign location 
consequently  exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and other currencies could have a material impact on our profitability 
we rely on distributors that we do not control 
we rely significantly on a global network of independent  regional distributors to market and distribute our cinema and broadcast products 
our distributor arrangements are non exclusive and our distributors are not obligated to buy our products and can represent competing products 
the loss of a major distributor or the inability or unwillingness of our distributors to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of products could adversely affect our revenue 
furthermore  our distributors could retain product channel inventory levels that exceed future anticipated sales  which could adversely affect future sales to those distributors 
in addition  failures of our distributors to adhere to our policies or other ethical practices could adversely affect us 
for example  while we have implemented policies designed to promote compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act  export controls  and local laws  we do not have direct control over the business and risk management policies adopted by our distributors  and they could act contrary to our policies 
for the foreseeable future  ray dolby or his affiliates or family members will be able to control the selection of all members of our board of directors  as well as virtually every other matter that requires stockholder approval  which will severely limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters 
at september   ray dolby and his affiliates  including his family members  owned  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock 
as of september   ray dolby and his affiliates  including his family members  had voting power of approximately of our outstanding class b common stock  which in the aggregate represented approximately of the combined voting power of our outstanding class a and class b common stock 
under our certificate of incorporation  holders of class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share while holders of class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
generally  shares of class b common stock automatically convert into shares of class a common stock upon transfer of such class b common stock  other than transfers to certain specified persons and entities  including the spouse and descendants of ray dolby and the spouses and domestic partners of such descendants 
because of this dual class structure  ray dolby  his affiliates  and his family members and descendants will  for the foreseeable future  have significant influence over our management and affairs  and will be able to control virtually all matters 
table of contents requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other sales of our company or assets  even if they come to own considerably less than of the total number of outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock 
ray dolby  his affiliates  his family members  and descendants will maintain this control even if in the future they come to own considerably less than of the total number of outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock 
moreover  these persons may take actions in their own interests that our stockholders do not view as beneficial 
absent a transfer of class b common stock that would trigger an automatic conversion as described above  there is no threshold or time deadline at which the shares of class b common stock will automatically convert into shares of class a common stock 
assuming conversion of all shares of class b common stock held by persons not affiliated with ray dolby into shares of class a common stock  so long as ray dolby and his affiliates  his family members  and descendants continue to hold shares of class b common stock representing approximately or more of the total number of outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock  they will hold a majority of the combined voting power of the class a and class b common stock 
future sales of shares by insiders could cause our stock price to decline 
if our founder  officers  directors or employees sell  or indicate an intention to sell  substantial amounts of our class a common stock in the public market  including shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of class b common stock  the trading price of our class a common stock could decline

the trading plans were adopted during an open window in accordance with guidelines specified by rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended  and as permitted by the company s insider trading policy 
sales under the trading plans commenced in august  are based upon pre established stock price thresholds  are subject to daily volume limits and will expire once all of the shares have been sold or in august  whichever is earlier 
we cannot predict the effect the trading plan sales may have on the future trading prices of our class a common stock 
as of september   we had a total of  shares of class a and class b common stock outstanding 
as of september   our directors and executive officers beneficially held  shares of class b common stock   shares of class a common stock  vested options to purchase  shares of class b common stock and vested options to purchase  shares of class a common stock 
we expect that any sale of our class a common stock by our directors and executive officers would be subject to compliance with rule under the securities act

we disclaim any duty to update any of the forward looking statements to conform our prior statements to actual results 
overview dolby laboratories has been a leading solutions provider to the entertainment industry for more than years 
we provide products  services  and technologies to capture  distribute  and play back entertainment content that gives consumers a premium entertainment experience  regardless of how or where they choose to enjoy it 
our core strengths range from our expertise in digital signal processing and compression technology to our long history of providing products  tools  and technologies to participants in the entertainment industry at each stage in the content creation  distribution  and playback process 
we provide products and services that enable content creators and distributors to produce  encode  and transmit content with our premium audio technologies  and we license decoding technologies to the manufacturers of entertainment devices to ensure that content is ultimately experienced as the creator and distributor intended 
throughout our history  we have introduced numerous innovations that have significantly improved the quality of audio entertainment  such as noise reduction for the recording and cinema industries and surround sound for cinema and home entertainment 
today  we continue to derive the vast majority of our revenue from our audio technologies 
looking forward  we see a number of industry trends that create opportunities for the continued growth of our audio business  including the ongoing global transition from analog to digital television and consumers increasing use of mobile devices  such as tablets and smartphones  to play back digital content 
our portfolio of technologies and solutions optimize the audio experience for portable devices to provide consumers with a rich  clear  and immersive sound  despite the bandwidth limitations of online and cellular networks and the physical limitations of devices with tiny speakers 
we also see opportunities to apply our core strengths in areas beyond audio 
for example  we believe that significant improvements can be made in the technology currently used to deliver and play back premium video  and we have identified solutions that may substantially improve the video experience 
similarly  we believe we can apply our existing audio technologies to improve the clarity and quality of voice communications in areas such as multi party teleconferencing 
business model we generate the majority of our revenue by licensing technologies to original equipment manufacturers oem of consumer entertainment ce products and to software vendors 
we also generate revenue by selling products and related services to creators and distributors and exhibitors of entertainment content 
we participate in the global entertainment industry in three important ways we offer products  services  and technologies to creators and distributors of entertainment content  such as motion picture  television  and music recording studios  television broadcasters  satellite and cable operators  cinema theatre chains  and increasingly  internet content streaming and download service providers 
these content creators and distributors use our products  services  and technologies to encode and transmit content  creating rich  clear  and immersive audio experiences for consumers upon playback 
we license technologies  such as dolby digital  dolby digital plus  dolby truehd  to oems and software vendors for incorporation into their ce and other products  so that consumers can play back audio content with our technologies in the rich  clear  and immersive manner the creators intended 
we work directly with standards setting organizations in the entertainment and technology industries  as well as governments and other regulatory bodies  to promote adoption of our technologies in their standards 
as a result  our technologies are included in the majority of worldwide tv shipments to support digital tv standards around the world that mandate our formats 
our technologies are also included in virtually all dvd players  blu ray disc players  audio video receivers  and personal computer pc dvd software players 
we license our technologies to oems and software vendors in countries and our licensees distribute products incorporating our technologies throughout the world 
we sell our products and services in over countries 
in fiscal   and revenue from outside of the us was   and of our total revenue  respectively 
our licensing business is our most significant revenue stream  representing   and of our total revenue in fiscal   and 
table of contents  respectively 
geographic data for our licensing revenue is based on the location of our licensees headquarters 
product revenue is based on the destination to which we ship our products  while services revenue is based on the location where services are performed 
opportunities  challenges  and risks our licensing and product markets are characterized by rapid technological changes  new and improved product introductions  changing customer demands  evolving industry standards  changing licensee needs  and product obsolescence 
we believe that these changes present us with opportunities to provide realistic and immersive audio experiences to consumers through new and emerging delivery channels 
however  as described below  our licensing revenue is subject to uncertainties and trends relating to technology and market growth  as well as the mix of ce products sold that incorporate our technologies 
our licensing business also could be affected by adverse general economic conditions  because many of the products in which our technologies are incorporated are discretionary goods 
furthermore  our products business is subject to intense competition and uncertainties relating to the transition to digital cinema and purchasing decisions by our cinema customers 
we expect recent declines in our d revenue to continue  as the market for d products becomes increasingly saturated 
licensing licensing revenue constitutes the majority of our total revenue  representing   and of total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
the entertainment industry is in transition 
as consumers are presented with more options for receiving entertainment content  competition across the delivery channels has intensified 
we see this reflected in the changing composition of our licensing revenue  driven by a shift away from optical disc based products 
our optical disc based revenue is generated from the sale of technology solutions that enable dvd or blu ray disc playback functionality  licensing including the windows operating system  independent pc dvd software players  dvd  and blu ray disc technologies included in consumer products 
however  most of these products can also receive content over mobile or online networks and we have increased our technology penetration into these other distribution channels 
non optical disc based revenue is generated from the sale of technology solutions other than those used to enable dvd or blu ray disc playback functionality 
non optical disc based revenue includes licensing revenue derived from products such as tvs  set top boxes  and mobile devices  as well as from the incorporation of our post processing technologies in a range of devices 
we remain focused on delivering the products  tools  and technologies needed to ensure a high quality audio experience from any device 
looking forward  we expect continued growth in the proportion of our licensing revenue we derive from non optical disc sources 
this will be driven partly by the maturity of optical disc as a method for delivering content  but also by the significant opportunities presented by digital broadcast and online and mobile distribution  as well as the inclusion of our technologies in the windows operating system to enable the playback of online content 
we also see significant opportunities to offer encode decode solutions in video and voice that leverage our expertise in signal processing  compression  and the capture and playback of content 
our licensing revenue comes from the following markets and primarily from the inclusion of our technologies in the products indicated for each market broadcast market primarily televisions and set top boxes pc market primarily dvd software players and microsoft windows operating systems ce market primarily dvd and blu ray disc players and recorders  audio video receivers  and home theater in a box systems other markets mobile primarily cell phones  tablets and other mobile devices gaming primarily video game consoles licensing services primarily administration of joint licensing programs automotive primarily in car dvd players the growth of the internet  and the related shift by consumers toward online entertainment content  has resulted in a global trend toward an array of online content streaming and download services 
today content is captured  delivered  and played back in more ways than ever before 
content creators and distributors are increasingly focused on delivering content across a multitude of media and devices with varying bandwidth and performance requirements  including pcs  connected tvs  set top boxes  gaming consoles  connected blu ray disc players  and a variety of mobile devices 
many of these mobile devices 
table of contents are increasingly designed to capture and distribute content through improved camera and wifi technologies  as well as to play back rich entertainment experiences 
this increasingly complex array of devices  with capability for both creating and playing back content  presents a challenge for content creators and device manufacturers seeking consistent audio quality 
we believe this challenge provides an opportunity similar to that of digital broadcast  whereby we can provide solutions to optimize the audio experience across the online and portable device ecosystem 
in the area of content creation and delivery  our technologies are included in dvd  blu ray disc  and certain broadcast standards  and we are working to extend our technologies to online delivery services 
online content aggregators  including netflix  amazon  vudu  apple  hbo go  samsung s acetrax  and the roxio now platform  use our technologies to encode video and audio content 
leading music services such as rhapsody and omnifone use our audio encoding tools to deliver a rich music experience to their subscribers 
in the second quarter of fiscal  hbo adopted dolby digital plus in its hbo go content for select connected tvs 
hbo will also offer dolby digital plus in its hbo go service for content delivered to blu ray disc players 
in addition  samsung now offers dolby digital plus surround sound audio through the acetrax video on demand application 
our broadcast market  driven by demand for our technologies in televisions and set top boxes  represented approximately   and of our licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
dolby technology was included in a higher percentage of televisions and set top boxes in fiscal which drove increased revenue relative to fiscal we view the broadcast market as an area for potential continued growth  primarily in geographic markets outside of the us we see opportunities in working with specific operators and standards bodies across emerging markets to adopt our multichannel formats 
given  the percentage of the world s population that lives in countries in emerging markets and the number of televisions and set top boxes sold in such markets  we believe that these markets present significant opportunities for growth 
while there is no guarantee that the counties in the emerging markets will convert to digital television  we intend to ensure that we are well positioned to benefit from such transition if it occurs 
we also view broadcast services  such as terrestrial broadcast or iptv services  which operate under bandwidth constraints  as another area of opportunity for dolby digital plus 
these technologies enable the delivery of high quality audio content at reduced bit rates  thereby conserving bandwidth 
we may not  however  be able to extend our current success in the broadcast market to these new opportunities 
our pc market represented approximately   and of our licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our technologies are incorporated in the majority of pcs sold today  primarily because of the inclusion of dvd and blu ray disc playback in the majority of pcs and the inclusion of dolby technologies in the dvd and blu ray disc standards 
historically  we have licensed our technologies to a range of pc licensees  including independent software vendors isv  pc oems  and operating system providers 
the release of new versions of major pc operating systems has often resulted in changes in the mix of our pc licensees 
in  microsoft introduced its windows vista operating system  which included our technologies to enable dvd audio playback in two of its editions 
in fiscal  microsoft released its current operating system  windows  which includes our technologies within four editions 
as a result  since the mix of our pc licensing revenue from operating systems has increased relative to that from oems and isvs 
we currently license our audio codec technologies directly to oems such as apple  toshiba  and sony to support optical disc playback on pcs  and we license our pc entertainment experience pcee technologies to multiple pc oems through our pcee licensing program 
in may  we entered into an agreement with microsoft under which dolby digital plus channel decoding and dolby digital two channel encoding will be included in all pcs and tablets licensed to run the windows operating system 
under the arrangement  oems generally will be required to directly license and pay us a base royalty rate for the right to use the dolby technologies included in windows installed on the pcs and tablets they produce for online and file based content 
oems will be required to pay a higher per unit royalty for windows pcs that also include optical disc playback functionality  which will be implemented by isv applications 
this higher rate is consistent with rates paid historically for the inclusion of dolby disc playback software in the pc market 
in the near term  we expect the majority of pcs to continue to ship with optical disc drives and to include optical disc playback functionality 
we believe the microsoft windows arrangement provides a simple and consistent way for oems to enable playback with our technologies of content delivered by online services and video in local files on the device 
this is a different licensing arrangement than the one we have for windows the release of windows did not have a material financial impact in fiscal  as microsoft continued to license its windows operating systems with our technologies 
the ultimate financial impact of these licensing arrangements for windows on our licensing revenue is uncertain and will depend on several factors  including the extent and rate at which windows is adopted in the marketplace  the extent to which oems include optical disc playback in windows devices  the extent to which earlier versions of microsoft operating systems  including windows  continue to be licensed after the release of windows  
table of contents our ability to establish and extend licensing relationships directly with pc oems and isvs  the rate at which entertainment content shifts from optical disc media to online media  thus reducing the need for pcs to have optical disc drives and dvd and blu ray disc software players  and our ability to extend the adoption of our technologies to online and mobile platforms 
in the short term  revenue from our pc market remains dependent on several factors  including underlying pc unit shipment growth and the extent to which our technologies are included in operating systems and isv media applications 
we continue to face risks relating to purchasing trends away from traditional pcs and towards portable devices without optical disc drives  such as ultrabooks and tablets  which may not include our technologies  the prevalence of pc software that includes our technologies on an unauthorized and infringing basis  for which we receive no royalty payments  and continued decreasing inclusion of isv media applications by pc oems in their windows based pcs  as windows already incorporates dvd playback software 
our ce market  driven primarily by revenue attributable to sales of dvd and blu ray disc players and recorders  represented approximately   and of licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
blu ray disc players continue to represent an important source of revenue within our ce market  as these players are required by the applicable standards of the blu ray disc association to include dolby digital technology for primary audio content and our dolby digital plus technology for secondary audio content 
in addition  our dolby truehd technology is an optional audio standard for blu ray disc 
sales of dvd players are declining  as a result of the maturity of the dvd platform and a shift to blu ray disc players and other connected devices capable of delivering content  however  our revenue from sales of blu ray disc players is also decreasing and has not offset the decline in revenue from dvd 
revenue generated from our other markets includes revenue attributable to mobile  gaming  licensing services  and automotive  and represented approximately   and of licensing revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
mobile revenue is primarily driven by demand for the dolby digital plus  aac  dolby mobile  and dolby digital 
we view the mobile device market as an area of opportunity for us to increase revenue  however  actual results may differ from our expectations 
in addition  because the mobile device market is a relatively new market for us  our growth in this market is dependent not only on the anticipated growth of the mobile device market as a whole  but also on the success of the mobile devices incorporating our technologies 
revenue attributable to gaming and automotive is primarily driven by sales of video game consoles and in car entertainment systems  respectively  that incorporate our dolby digital  dolby digital plus  aac  and dolby truehd technologies 
licensing services revenue  from administration of joint licensing programs  is primarily driven by demand for standards based audio compression technologies for broadcast  pc  ce  and mobile products 
consumer entertainment products throughout the world incorporate our technologies 
we expect that sales of such products incorporating our technologies in emerging economies such as brazil  china  india  and russia  will increase in the future as consumers in these markets acquire more disposable income with which to purchase entertainment products 
however  events in these economies or in the world economy in general may contradict these expectations 
moreover  we expect that oems in lower cost manufacturing countries  including china  will increase production in response to this demand and that traditional oems will continue to shift their manufacturing operations to these lower cost manufacturing countries 
there are substantial risks associated with doing business in such countries  including oems failing to report or underreporting shipments of products incorporating our technologies  that have affected and will continue to affect our operating results 
revenue from microsoft represented approximately   and of our total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively  and included licensing revenue from our pc  ce  and other markets 
products products revenue is driven primarily by sales of equipment to cinema operators and broadcasters and represented   and of our total revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our cinema products represented approximately   and of total products revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales of our cinema products tend to fluctuate based on the underlying trends in the cinema industry  including the popularity of individual movies  as cinema owners often purchase equipment to meet expected box office demand 
the cinema industry is transitioning from traditional film to digital cinema  and we estimate that the industry is more than halfway through this transition 
digital cinema offers motion picture studios a means to save costs in printing and distributing movies  combat piracy  and enable repeated movie playback without degradation in image and audio quality 
our cinema 
table of contents products include our dolby digital cinema screen server and central library server  for the storage and playback of digital content  and our digital audio processor  which provides audio control for our digital cinema servers 
we expect that most cinema owners who are either constructing new theaters or upgrading existing theaters will choose digital cinema products over traditional film cinema products 
however  our competitive position in the digital cinema market is not as strong as our position in the traditional film cinema market 
for example  digital cinema specifications are based on open standards which  unlike traditional cinema standards  do not include our proprietary audio technologies 
furthermore  we are facing more pricing and other competitive pressures for our digital cinema products than we experience for our traditional film cinema products 
digital cinema standards are defined by the digital cinema initiative dci specifications  and we have developed software for our currently available digital cinema server that is dci compliant 
this software was made commercially available during fiscal we do not have significant contractual provisions arising from the sale of products relating to dci compliance that would require additional performance from us 
our digital d products provide d image capabilities when combined with a digital cinema projector and server 
our cinema products revenue has been negatively impacted by declines in unit shipments and lower selling prices for d products  as the market for d cinema equipment has become increasingly competitive 
we also believe the decrease in revenue from our d products reflects the increasing saturation of d enabled screens within the cinema industry 
our traditional film cinema products are used primarily to read  decode  and play back film soundtracks  to calibrate cinema sound systems  and to enable soundtracks encoded in digital audio formats to be played back on analog cinema audio systems 
as investment by the cinema industry in digital cinema has increased  revenue from our traditional film cinema products has declined  and we expect this decline to continue 
our broadcast products represented approximately   and of products revenue in fiscal   and  respectively 
our broadcast products are used to encode  transmit  and decode multiple channels of high quality audio content for dtv and hdtv program production and broadcast distribution and to measure the subjective loudness of audio content within broadcast programming 
in fiscal  we began selling our professional reference monitor product  a flat panel video reference display for video professionals 
these video professionals use the monitor for color critical tasks  such as calibrating color accuracy to professional reference standards 
our professional reference monitor uses our dynamic range imaging technologies  which enhance contrast and extend brightness and dynamic range  while reducing power consumption in led backlit lcd televisions 
we did not generate significant revenue from this product in fiscal services services revenue represented approximately of total revenue in each of fiscal   and the level of our services revenue is primarily tied to activity in the cinema industry  and in particular  to the number of movies being produced and distributed by studios and independent filmmakers 
several factors influence the number of movies produced in a given fiscal period  including strikes and work stoppages within the cinema industry  as well as tax incentive arrangements provided by many governments to promote local filmmaking 
services revenue is also impacted by the transition to digital cinema in some regions 
other we are party to an agreement under which we obtained naming rights and related benefits with respect to the dolby theatre in hollywood  california 
under the agreement  we made one annual payment in fiscal and will subsequently make semi annual payments over the term  which will be recorded as marketing expenses 
our payment obligations are conditioned in part on the academy awards being held and broadcast from the dolby theatre 
for additional details  see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these contractual obligations  we anticipate that we will continue to incur increased marketing expenses associated with promoting our products  technologies  and brand at the dolby theatre 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  and pursuant to securities and exchange commission sec rules and regulations 
gaap and sec rules and regulations require us to use accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a fiscal period 
the sec considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and or results of operations and requires significant judgment on the part of management in its application 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgment  and estimates 
we have discussed the selection and 
table of contents development of the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this annual report on form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies and estimates because we believe they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management judgments about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially  our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected 
see our risk factors for further information on the potential risks to our future results of operations 
revenue recognition we enter into revenue arrangements with our customers to license technologies  trademarks  and know how and to sell products and services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
judgment is required to assess whether collectibility is probable 
we determine collectibility based on an evaluation of our customer s recent payment history  the existence of a standby letter of credit between the customer s financial institution and our financial institution  and other factors 
some of our revenue arrangements include multiple elements  such as hardware  software  maintenance  and other services 
we evaluate each element in a multiple element me arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
an element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and delivery of an undelivered element is both probable and within our control 
when these criteria are not met  the delivered and undelivered elements are combined and the arrangement fees are allocated to this combined single unit 
if the unit separation criteria are met  we account for each element within a me arrangement such as hardware  software  maintenance  and other services separately  and we allocate fees from the arrangement based on its relative selling price  which we establish using a selling price hierarchy 
we determine the selling price of each element based on its vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
for some arrangements  customers receive certain elements over a period of time  after delivery of the initial product 
these elements may include support and maintenance and or the right to receive upgrades 
revenue allocated to the undelivered element is recognized either over its estimated service period or when the upgrade is delivered 
we do not recognize revenue that is contingent upon the future delivery of products or services or upon future performance obligations 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when we have completed all contractual obligations 
we determine our best estimate of the selling price for an individual element within a me revenue arrangement using the same methods used to determine the selling price of an element sold on a standalone basis 
if we sell the element on a standalone basis  we estimate the selling price by considering actual sales prices 
otherwise  we estimate the selling price by considering internal factors such as pricing practices and margin objectives 
consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies  customer demands  and industry technology lifecycles 
management applies judgment to establish margin objectives  pricing strategies  and technology lifecycles 
revenue recognition for transactions which involve software  such as fees we earn from certain system licensees  requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
for some of our me arrangements  customers receive certain elements of the arrangement over a period of time or after delivery of the initial software 
these elements may include support and maintenance 
the fair values of these elements are recognized over the estimated period for which these elements will be delivered  which is sometimes the estimated life of the software 
if we do not have vsoe of fair value for any undelivered element included in these me arrangements for software  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and or services have been performed  or until we have vsoe of fair value for all remaining undelivered elements 
if the undelivered element is support and we do not have fair value for the support element  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
we account for our digital cinema server sales as me arrangements that may include up to three separate units  or elements  of accounting 
the first element consists of our digital cinema server hardware and the accompanying software  which is essential to the functionality of the hardware 
this element is typically delivered at the time of sale 
the second element is the right to receive support and maintenance  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered over a service period subsequent to the initial sale 
the third element is the right to receive specified upgrades  which is included with the purchase of the hardware element and is typically delivered when a specified upgrade is available  subsequent to the initial sale 
the application of the revenue accounting standards to our digital cinema server sales typically results in the allocation of a substantial majority of the arrangement fees to the delivered hardware element based on 
table of contents its esp  relative to the vsoe or esp of the other elements  which we recognize as revenue at the time of sale 
a small portion of the arrangement fees is allocated to the undelivered support and maintenance element  and in some cases to the undelivered specified upgrade element  based on the vsoe or esp of each element 
the portion of the arrangement fees allocated to the support and maintenance element is recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated service period and the portion of the arrangement fees allocated to specified upgrades is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the upgrade 
goodwill  intangible assets  and long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired 
in september  the fasb issued asu which amends the rules for testing goodwill for impairment 
we adopted the provisions of asu for our annual goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter of fiscal asu permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
in performing the qualitative assessment  we consider events and circumstances  including but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  changes in management or key personnel  changes in strategy  changes in customers  changes in the composition or carrying amount of a reporting unit s net assets and changes in the price of our common stock 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then the two step goodwill impairment test is not performed 
if the two step goodwill test is performed  we evaluate and test our goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level using expected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the calculated fair value of the goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below 
our operating segments are aligned with the management principles of our business 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment in the fiscal quarter ended june  at the time of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal  we had two reporting units via  which corresponds to our wholly owned subsidiary and has no assigned goodwill  and dolby entertainment technology det  with goodwill of million 
we determined  after performing a qualitative review and assessing the totality of the events and circumstances described above  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
accordingly  there was no indication of impairment and the two step goodwill impairment test was not performed 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment losses in fiscal   or intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
our intangible assets principally consist of acquired technology  patents  trademarks  customer relationships  and contracts  which are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives ranging from two to fifteen years 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying value to the total future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes we make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this includes estimating actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of the recognition of stock based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
our policy is to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position is sustainable upon examination by tax authorities 
we include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
when accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued are reduced in the period that such determination is made and are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax asset and liability balances  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and the reserve resulting from uncertainties in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results differ significantly from 
table of contents these estimates or if the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
valuation and classification of investments fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value using a three level hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the investment that are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity  such as market quoted prices 
gaap establishes a three level hierarchy prioritizing the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets that are accessible by us at the measurement date for identical investments  described as level  and the lowest priority to valuation techniques using unobservable inputs  described as level we obtain the fair value of our level financial instruments from a professional pricing service  which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments 
fair value from this professional pricing source can also be based on pricing models whereby all significant inputs  including maturity dates  issue dates  settlement dates  benchmark yields  reported trades  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids  offers  and other market related data  are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 
the degree to which estimates and judgment are used in determining fair value  is generally dependent upon the market pricing information available for the investments  the availability of observable inputs  the frequency of trading in the investments and the investment s complexity 
if different judgments regarding inputs were made  we could potentially reach different conclusions regarding the fair value of our investments 
stock based compensation we determine the expense for all employee stock based compensation awards by estimating their fair value and recognizing that value as an expense  on a ratable basis  in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period in which our employees earn the awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant 
to determine the fair value of a stock based award using the black scholes option pricing model  we make assumptions regarding the expected term of the award  the expected future volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award  and the risk free interest rate over the expected term of the award 
we estimate the expected term of our stock based awards by evaluating historical exercise patterns of our employees 
we use a blend of the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility of our traded options as an estimate of the expected volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the awards 
we use an average interest rate based on us treasury instruments with terms consistent with the expected term of our awards to estimate the risk free interest rate 
we reduce the stock based compensation expense for estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of the grant and revise our estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimate

the decrease in revenue from our pc market was primarily driven by decreased isv media applications in pc shipments 
products 
the decrease in products revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to decreases in our d and traditional cinema products driven by lower shipments and lower selling prices 
the decrease in products revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to decreases in d and traditional cinema products revenue in fiscal  coupled with our adoption of new revenue recognition accounting standards in fiscal decreases in d products revenue in fiscal resulted from increased competition and promotional pricing  while decreases in traditional cinema products revenue were primarily due to lower shipments  as more exhibitors converted to digital cinema 
in addition  products revenue in fiscal included recognition of million of deferred revenue related to sales prior to the beginning of the year  which were accounted for under previous revenue accounting standards 
in fiscal substantially all products revenue resulting from current period sales were accounted for under the new accounting standards 
services 
the decrease in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was attributable primarily to a decrease in film based production services revenue as the cinema industry transitions to digital cinema as well as decreases in virtual print fees  which were generated from certain leased digital cinema assets  as we discontinued this program in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by an increase in maintenance and support services 
the increase in services revenue from fiscal to fiscal was primarily driven by increases in revenue from support and maintenance for digital cinema equipment and from other theater services

in addition  depreciation expense related to digital cinema equipment leased to exhibitors was lower in fiscal impairment of products provided under operating leases 
our products provided under operating leases represent digital cinema equipment that we leased to exhibitors beginning in fiscal in an effort to encourage the cinema industry to transition to digital cinema 
we receive a virtual print fee from participating film studios for each digital print delivered for exhibition on this equipment 
based on our estimates of future cash flows from virtual print fees and the potential sale value of this equipment  we determined that the equipment was impaired in fiscal accordingly  we recorded the million excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value of the equipment as an impairment charge

table of contents our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents  and investments  as well as cash flows from operations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  and potential cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months 
we have historically generated significant cash from our operations  however  there can be no assurance that our operations will continue to generate significant cash flows in the future 
we retain sufficient cash holdings to support our operations and we also purchase investment grade securities diversified among security types  industries  and issuers 
we have used cash generated from our operations to fund a variety of activities related to our business in addition to our ongoing operations  including business expansion and growth  acquisitions  and repurchases of our common stock 
cash provided by operations and the value of our investment portfolio could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties  as described in part ii  item a risk factors 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal decreased million when compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following a decrease in net income  as adjusted for non cash items  a decrease in deferred revenue in fiscal due to timing of licensing contracts  offset by a decrease in accounts receivable due to timing differences and higher collections in fiscal net cash used in investing activities during fiscal decreased million when compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following an increase in proceeds from the sale and maturities of available for sale securities  offset by an increase in capital expenditures in fiscal which includes the purchase of the market street building  and acquisition of imm sound 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal increased million when compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following an increase in share repurchases of our class a common stock  and a decrease in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options granted to employees and the related tax benefit 
off balance sheet and contractual obligations our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period year years years more than years total in thousands naming rights operating leases purchase obligations total in april  we entered into an agreement for naming rights and related benefits with respect to the dolby theatre in hollywood  california  the location of the academy awards 
in exchange for these rights and other benefits  we made one annual payment in fiscal and will subsequently make semi annual payments over the term 
our payment obligations are conditioned in part on the academy awards being held and broadcast from the dolby theatre 
the term of the agreement is years 
operating lease payments include future minimum rental commitments  including those payable to our principal stockholder and portions attributable to the controlling interests in our wholly owned subsidiaries  for non cancelable operating leases of office space as of september  our purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services  entered into in the ordinary course of business 
these represent non cancelable commitments for which a penalty would be imposed if the agreement was canceled for any reason other than an event of default as described by the agreement 
as of september   we had an accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties  net of related deferred tax assets  totaling million 
we are unable to estimate when any cash settlement with a taxing authority might occur

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds 
in addition  we had short term and long term investments of million  which consisted primarily of municipal debt securities  corporate bonds  and us agency securities 
our investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and on supporting our liquidity requirements 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
our holdings of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  the majority of which are managed by external managers  meet the guidelines of our investment policy 
we invest in highly rated securities with a minimum credit rating of a and our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the us government 
at september   our weighted average portfolio credit quality was aa and the weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio was approximately one year 
the investments within our fixed income portfolio are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which could affect our financial position  and to a lesser extent  results of operations 
based on our investment portfolio balance as of september   hypothetical changes in interest rates of and would have an impact on the carrying value of our portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales  marketing  and business operations in foreign countries  most significantly in the united kingdom  australia  china  the netherlands  and germany 
we also conduct a growing portion of our business outside of the us through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar primarily british pound  australian dollar  chinese yuan renminbi  and euro 
as a result  we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into us dollars upon consolidation 
most of our revenue from international markets is denominated in us dollars  while the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currency 
therefore  if the us dollar weakens against the local currency  we will have increased operating expenses  which will only be partially offset by net revenue 
conversely  if the us dollar strengthens against the local currency  operating expenses will decrease  which will only be partially offset by net revenue 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against assets and liabilities for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure  in an effort to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
these derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to interest and other expense income  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
our foreign currency forward contracts which are not designated as hedging instruments are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables 
these contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the related receivables and payables for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
as of september  and september   the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of days or less and the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were million and million  respectively 
the fair values of these contracts were not material as of september  and september   and were included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
for additional information related to our foreign currency forward contracts  see note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign currency forward contracts as of september  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for these forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a increase in the value of the us dollar would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments by million 
conversely  a decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million
