executive summary we are a self managed  publicly traded real estate investment trust reit that owns and operates neighborhood  community  power and single tenant retail centers 
we also may construct or develop properties or render services in connection with construction or development 
our investment properties are typically anchored by grocery  drug or discount stores  which provide everyday goods and services to consumers  rather than stores that sell discretionary items 
we seek to acquire properties with high quality tenants and attempt to mitigate our risk of tenant defaults by maintaining a diversified tenant base 
as of december   no single tenant accounted for more than approximately of annual base rent in our total portfolio 
we are incorporated under maryland law and have qualified and elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ended december  since we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is distributed to stockholders  however  we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
moreover  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income  property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  without the benefit of certain relief provisions of the code we will be subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
we engage in certain activities through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries trs entities  inland venture corporation ivc and inland exchange venture corporation ievc 
trs entities engage in activities that would otherwise produce income that would not be reit qualifying income  such as managing properties owned through our joint ventures 
trs entities are subject to federal and state income and franchise taxes 

table of contents our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties as well as the interest expense on our mortgages payable and other debt obligations 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
pursuant to lease agreements  most tenants are required to reimburse us for some or all of their pro rata share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the property 
during the recent economic downturn  our financial results were negatively impacted by increased vacancies  increased time to re lease vacant spaces  reduced recovery income resulting from the decreased occupancy and lower rental rates on newly signed leases 
as the real estate market has begun to improve  we have experienced an increase in recovery income  which we expect to continue as we work to fill remaining vacancies and restore our occupancy to our historical  pre recession  mid percent levels 
we have also begun to experience an increase in market rental rates 
releasing vacant space has costs  including leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  which have the effect of reducing cash flow at the beginning of a new lease 
additionally  many leases contain tenant concessions  which delay the recognition of rental income during the abatement period 
during the three and twelve months ended december   we recorded  and  respectively of tenant concessions and during the three and twelve months ended december   these amounts were  and  respectively 
to measure our operating results against those of other retail real estate owners operators  we compare occupancy percentages and our rental rates to the average rents charged by our competitors in similar centers 
to measure our operating results against those of other reits  we compare company wide growth in net income and ffo  growth in same store net operating income and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues and total assets 
during the year ended december   our leasing activity remained strong and our leasing spreads were positive on both new and renewed leases in our consolidated portfolio 
during the year ended december   we executed new  renewal and non comparable leases expansion square footage or spaces for which no former tenant was in place for one year or more  aggregating approximately  square feet of our consolidated portfolio 
the new leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expiring rate 
the renewal leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average rental rate of per square foot  a increase over the average expiring rate 
the non comparable leases comprise approximately  square feet with an average base rent of per square foot 
the calculations of former and new average base rents are adjusted for rent abatements 
during the year ended december   the average leasing commission on leases signed was approximately per square foot  the average cost for tenant improvements was approximately per square foot and the average period given for rent concessions was three to five months 
during  leases  comprising approximately  square feet and accounting for approximately of our annualized base rent  will be expiring in our consolidated portfolio 
none of the expiring leases is deemed to be material to our financial results 
the weighted average expiring rate on these leases is per square foot 
we will continue to attempt to renew expiring leases and re lease those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at more favorable rental rates to increase revenue and cash flow 
occupancy as of december   september  and december  for our consolidated  unconsolidated and total portfolios is summarized below consolidated occupancy as of december  as of september  as of december  leased occupancy a financial occupancy b same store financial occupancy 
table of contents unconsolidated occupancy c as of december  as of september  as of december  leased occupancy a financial occupancy b same store financial occupancy total occupancy as of december  as of september  as of december  leased occupancy a financial occupancy b same store financial occupancy a leased occupancy is defined as the percentage of gross leasable area for which there is a signed lease  regardless of whether the tenant is currently obligated to pay rent under their lease agreement 
b financial occupancy is defined as the percentage of total gross leasable area for which a tenant is obligated to pay rent under the terms of its lease agreement  regardless of the actual use or occupation by that tenant of the area being leased  excluding tenants in their abatement period 
c unconsolidated occupancy is based on our percentage ownership 
the decrease in leased occupancy was primarily due to lease expirations on two big box spaces that are currently being marketed for sale or lease  as well as the sales of percent occupied properties in the consolidated and unconsolidated portfolios during the quarter 
we pay affiliates of the inland group  inc tigi for various administrative services 
these services are provided at cost 
tigi  through its affiliates  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
for accounting purposes however  we are not directly affiliated with tigi or its affiliates 
during the years ended december   and  we paid to tigi and or its affiliates   and  respectively  for these various services 
reference is made to note  transactions with related parties to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detail of the total amounts paid during the previous three years 
the increase during the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and is related to costs incurred to upgrade our current accounting system and for increased broker services 
we expect to incur additional costs during related to the system upgrade  which is scheduled to be completed during the second quarter of the costs for the upgrade have been capitalized and are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the increased broker costs are related to the use of a tigi affiliate for certain financing transactions that closed during the year ended december  we expect to continue to use these services during however  the level of use has not yet been determined 
strategies and objectives current strategies our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our success in operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  management  leasing and development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  of our properties 
during  our focus was on increasing assets under management through our joint ventures with pggm and ipcc 
acquisitions for these joint ventures provide us with immediate and ongoing fee income 
additionally  we focused on our leasing activity 
we maintained strong leasing activity during the recent economic downturn and we will continue to work to fill existing vacancies 

table of contents during  we continued our efforts to control and reduce property operating expenses 
we were able to work with both our existing and new vendors to achieve lower unit prices  due to our market concentration and in certain circumstances  enter into multi year contracts with these vendors 
these unit price reductions were a factor of the lower property operating expenses incurred during the year ended december   as compared to prior years 
in addition to the price reductions  we experienced a lower volume of maintenance and snow removal costs during we expect the price reductions to be in effect during  however  we are not assured that property operating expenses will continue to decrease as we cannot estimate the volume of services that will be required in future years 
our focus for will be to continue to grow assets under management through our joint ventures with pggm and ipcc 
we look to complete the acquisition goals of our joint venture with pggm by acquiring the remaining  in new targeted acquisitions 
we also look to formalize a permanent extension of our joint venture agreement with nsytrs  which is currently extended through june  finally  we look to continue to acquire properties through our joint venture with ipcc to provide additional acquisition fee income as well as ongoing management fee income 
acquisition strategies we seek to selectively acquire well located open air retail centers that meet our investment criteria 
we will  from time to time  acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers requiring financing or financing contingencies 
additionally  we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
additionally  we have been successful in leasing additional space to some existing tenants in our current investment properties 
joint ventures we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be redeveloped and vacant land to be developed 
we structure these ventures to earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  asset management  acquisition and leasing services 
we will continue to receive management and leasing fees for those investment properties under management  however  acquisition fees may decrease as we acquire fewer investment properties through these ventures 
additionally  we have formed a joint venture to acquire properties that are ultimately sold to investors through a private offering of tenant in common tic interests or interests in delaware statutory trusts dst 
we earn fees from the joint venture for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
we will continue to receive management and leasing fees for those properties under management  even after all of the tic or dst interests have been sold 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities to provide operating efficiencies 
we seek to improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
we emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
we maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
we proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities

acres sales price savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il north aurora outlots phase i north american real estate north aurora il savannah crossing tmk development  inc aurora il critical accounting policies general 
a critical accounting policy is one that  we believe  would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to the recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries  allocation and valuation of investment properties  consolidation equity accounting policies and our investment in securities 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
us gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties that were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under us gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectability of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we have reason to believe will be uncollectible  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculated by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 
as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
allocation of investment properties 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any financing assumed that is determined to be above or below market terms 
purchase price allocations are based on our estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
in some circumstances we engage independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocation 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar investment properties 

table of contents we expense acquisition costs for investment property acquisitions  accounted for as business combinations  to record the acquisition at its fair value 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
for below market leases with fixed rate renewals  renewal periods are included in the calculation of below market lease values and the amortization period 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the values of the acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the life of each respective lease as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the life of the related lease for each property as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 
the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
impairment of investment properties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
we assess the carrying values of our investment properties  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these investment properties may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of the investment properties is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the investment property to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
in order to review our investment properties for recoverability  we consider current market conditions  as well as our intent with respect to holding or disposing of the asset 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow models  quoted market values and third party appraisals  where considered necessary 
if our analysis indicates that the carrying value of the investment property is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis  we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the current estimated fair value of the real estate property 

table of contents we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows based on management s intent as follows i for real estate properties that we intend to hold long term  including land held for development  properties currently under development and operating buildings  recoverability is assessed based on the estimated future net rental income from operating the property  ii for real estate properties that we intend to sell  including land parcels  properties currently under development and operating buildings  recoverability is assessed based on estimated proceeds from disposition that are estimated based on future net rental income of the property and expected market capitalization rates  and iii for costs incurred related to the potential acquisition or development of a real estate property  recoverability is assessed based on the probability that the acquisition or development is likely to occur as of the measurement date 
the use of projected future cash flows is based on management s assumptions of future operations and is consistent with the strategic plan we use to manage our underlying business 
however assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows  discount rates and capitalization rates are complex and subjective 
changes in economic and operating conditions and our ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to our impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our real estate properties 
we also review our investments in unconsolidated entities 
when circumstances indicate there may have been a loss in value of an equity method investment  we evaluate the investment for impairment by estimating our ability to recover our investment from future expected cash flows 
if we determine the loss in value is other than temporary  we will recognize an impairment charge to reflect the investment at fair value 
the use of projected future cash flows and other estimates of fair value  the determination of when a loss is other than temporary and the calculation of the amount of the loss are complex and subjective processes 
use of other estimates and assumptions may result in different conclusions 
changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of our equity investments 
consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie 
the primary beneficiary is the party that has a controlling financial interest in the vie  which is defined as having both of the following characteristics the power to direct the activities that  when taken together  most significantly impact the vie s performance  and the obligation to absorb losses and right to receive the returns from the vie that would be significant to the vie 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate a vie  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a vie we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture are not consolidated with our operations 
instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
investment in securities 
we classify our investment in securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale  or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to maturity securities are those securities in which we have the ability and intent to hold the security until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
investment in securities at december  and consist of perpetual preferred securities and common securities classified as available for sale securities  which are recorded at fair value and preferred securities not classified as available for sale securities and therefore  recorded at cost 
we determined that these securities should be held at cost because the fair value is not readily determinable and there is no active market for these securities 
unrealized holding gains and losses on securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
realized gains and losses from the sale of securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary  results in a reduction in the carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established 

table of contents for an impaired security we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment for a time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and consider whether the evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary 
evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to year end and forecasted performance of the investee 
in addition  under the debt security model  an evaluation as to the underlying credit of the issuer is made 
however  without recovery in the near term such that liquidity returns to the markets and spreads return to levels that reflect underlying credit characteristics  additional other than temporary losses may occur in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources this section describes our balance sheet and discusses our liquidity and capital commitments 
our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents which consists of cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
the higher cash balance at december  reflects higher prepaid rents and sales activity in our joint venture with ipcc at year end  the proceeds of which were subsequently used to pay down the balance on our unsecured line of credit facility 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during the years ended december   and we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions could periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance coverage 
however  we do not believe the risk is significant based on our review of the rating of the institutions where our cash is deposited 
in  fdic insurance coverage was increased to  per depositor at each insured bank 
this increase will be in place until december   at which time it is expected to return to  per depositor  unless coverage is further extended 
all funds in a non interest bearing transaction account are insured in full by the fdic from december   through december  this temporary unlimited coverage is in addition to  and separate from  the coverage of at least  available to depositors under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities  including shares of our common stock sold under our drp and ongoing atm issuance program  draws on our unsecured line of credit facility  which may be limited due to covenant compliance requirements  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties  earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders and fee income received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants applicable to us 
we had up to  available under our  line of credit facility and an additional  available under an accordion feature 
the access to the accordion feature requires approval of the lending group 
if approved  the terms for the funds borrowed under the accordion feature would be current market terms and not the terms of the other borrowings under the line of credit facility 
the lending group is not obligated to approve access to the additional funds 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating expenses at our investment properties  for interest expense on our debt obligations  for purchasing additional investment properties  to meet joint venture commitments  to repay draws on the line of credit facility and for retiring mortgages payable 

table of contents in november  we entered into a three year sales agency agreement with bmo capital markets corp 
bmo to offer and sell up to million of our common stock from time to time through bmo  acting as sales agent 
offers and sales of shares of our common stock may be made in privately negotiated transactions if we and bmo have so agreed in writing or by any other method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule under the securities act  including sales made directly on the new york stock exchange or to or through a market maker 
as of december   we have issued an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock pursuant to the atm issuance program  since inception 
we received net proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of these shares  comprised of approximately  in gross proceeds  offset by approximately in commissions and fees 
we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include repayment of mortgage indebtedness secured by our properties  acquiring real property through wholly owned subsidiaries or through our investment in one or more joint venture entities or repaying amounts outstanding on our unsecured line of credit facility  among other things 
as of december   shares representing approximately  remain available for sale under this issuance program  which expires in november in october  we issued two million shares of series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock at a public offering price of per share  for net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount but before expenses 
the proceeds were initially used to pay down debt to capture interest expense savings 
a portion of the proceeds were then used to acquire bradley commons  an investment property acquired in november the remaining proceeds are expected to be used to acquire additional investment properties during the first quarter of in november  we entered into a new  seven year unsecured term loan with wells fargo bank  national association 
the proceeds from this new term loan  along with cash on hand and a draw on our line of credit facility  were used to repurchase the remaining  in principal amount outstanding of our convertible notes issued in as a means of conserving capital in recent years  we deferred making certain capital expenditures  such as those for roof and parking lot replacements 
additionally  as a result of the significant leasing activity we experienced during the last half of and during  we made significant expenditures related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions throughout the costs of these capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions were approximately  higher than the amount incurred during we funded these improvements using cash from operations and draws on our unsecured line of credit facility

also during the three and twelve months ended december   we incurred and  respectively  in costs for leasing commissions  as compared to and  for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
we do not expect this trend to carry forward into future years 
although we expect to fund these types of projects in the future  we expect the amount of spending on these items will return to levels comparable to years prior to we invest in marketable securities of other entities  including reits 
these investments in available for sale securities totaled  at december   consisting of preferred and common stock investments

additionally  during the year ended december   we realized a non cash impairment loss of  related to a decline in value of certain investment securities which were determined to be other than temporary 
no such losses were required or recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including properties owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures  but not including our development joint venture properties

net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash used in investing activities was the use of  to purchase investment properties and  in additions to investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to the use of  to purchase investment properties and  in additions to investment properties during the year ended december  additionally  we received proceeds of  from the sale of investment properties and from the change in control of investment properties during the year ended december   as compared to receiving proceeds of  from the sale of investment properties and  from the change in control of investment properties during the year ended december  partially offsetting the increase in cash used in investing activities was the receipt of  from the sale of property ownership interests in connection with our joint venture with ipcc during the year ended december   as compared to the receipt of  from the sale of property ownership interests during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to cash used in financing activities of  during the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the receipt of  in proceeds from our unsecured credit facilities during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  additionally  the issuance of shares  net of offering costs of  during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  further  during the year ended december   we received  in net loan proceeds as compared to  during the year ended december  partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by financing activities was the use of  to repurchase certain convertible notes during the year ended december   as compared to  during the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due primarily to decreased cash from property operations 
see our discussion of results of operations for an explanation of the decreases related to property operations

table of contents results of operations this section describes and compares our results of operations for the three years ended december   and at december   we had ownership interests in single user retail properties  neighborhood centers  community centers  power centers and lifestyle center 
we generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations 
in order to evaluate our overall portfolio  management analyzes the net operating income of properties that we have owned and operated for the same twelve month periods during each year  referred to herein as same store properties 
property net operating income is a non gaap measure that allows management to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio and determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income 
net operating income is also meaningful as an indicator of the effectiveness of our management of properties because net operating income excludes certain items that are not reflective of management  such as depreciation and interest expense 
a total of of our investment properties were same store properties during the periods presented 
these properties comprise approximately million square feet 
in the table below  other investment properties includes activity from properties acquired during the years ended december   and  two properties in which we took over ownership control from our joint venture partner  properties contributed to our joint ventures and activity from properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc while they were consolidated 
operations from properties acquired through this joint venture are recorded as consolidated income until those properties become unconsolidated with the first sale of ownership interests to investors 
once the operations are unconsolidated  the income is included in equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive income

total rental income increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   reflecting an increase in rental income from our other investment properties during the year 
the increase is a result of investment properties acquired during the years ended december  and  including the change in control transactions related to algonquin commons and orchard crossing  and properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc  while they are consolidated 
rental income decreased  on a same store basis  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to early termination of certain leases  tenant defaults and bankruptcies  expiring leases that were not renewed and rent relief granted in  the full impact of which occurred in total rental income decreased  reflecting a decrease in rental income from our other investment properties 
this increase is a result of investment properties acquired during the year ended december  and on properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc  while they were consolidated 
tenant recovery income decreased  on a same store basis  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreased property operating and real estate tax expenses

total tenant recovery income increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   reflecting an increase in tenant recovery income on our other investment properties 
other property income increased on a same store basis for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  and decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this change from year to year is due in most part to the level of lease termination fees recorded in each year

real estate tax expense decreased  on a same store basis and  in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in real estate tax expense during each period can be attributed to changes in assessed values of our investment properties by the various taxing authorities 

table of contents real estate tax expense decreased on a same store basis and increased  in total  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   respectively 
the change in real estate tax expense is a result of the assessed values of our investment properties by the various taxing authorities 
other income decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to decreased gains on the sale of investment securities 
additionally  during the year ended december   we were granted possession of a vacant building at our orland park place outlots investment property 
previously  we had a ground lease with a restaurant operator 
upon default by the tenant  we added this building to our portfolio  according to the lease terms  resulting in income of other income increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to gains on sale of certain investment securities and the of income from the vacant building assumption at orland park place outlots 
the increases were offset by a decrease in dividend income received on our investment in securities portfolio 
fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is mostly due to an increase in acquisition fees earned on sales of interests by our ipcc joint venture and increased management fees related to an increased number of properties under management through our unconsolidated joint ventures and the properties that have been fully sold through our ipcc joint venture 
fee income from unconsolidated joint ventures increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to fees earned through our joint venture with pggm 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in management fees earned from our joint venture with nystrs 
this decrease in management fee income is due to the change in control of algonquin commons which occurred on july  because algonquin commons is now a consolidated property  we no longer earn fees from the joint venture for managing it 
during the year ended december   we recorded a loss from change in control of investment properties of  related to orchard crossing  a property previously owned through our joint venture with pine tree institutional realty  llc pine tree 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain from change in control of investment properties of  related to algonquin commons  a property previously owned through our joint venture with new york state teachers retirement system 
prior to the change in control transactions  each property was unconsolidated and was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
gain on sale of joint venture interest decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is due to decreased gains on sale in connection with the length of time the properties sold during the year ended december  were held in our joint venture with ipcc 
gain on sale of joint venture interest increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to increased gains on sale in connection with sales of interest in properties through our joint venture with ipcc 
gain on extinguishment of debt decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is due to lower gains recorded for the purchase of certain of our convertible notes at a discount to the contract amount and discounts received for the early payoff of certain of our mortgages payable during the year ended december  no such gains were recorded during the year ended december  bad debt expense decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in bad debt expense is due to fewer tenant bankruptcies and tenant failures 
bad debt expense increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in bad debt expense is due to increased tenant bankruptcies and the economic challenges facing our tenants 

table of contents depreciation and amortization increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due to depreciation recorded on algonquin commons and orchard crossing after the change in control transactions  additional properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc  while they were consolidated  depreciation on new tenant improvement assets for work related to new leases and the write off of tenant improvement assets  as a result of early lease terminations 
depreciation and amortization decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   due in most part to the write off of tenant improvement assets  as a result of early lease terminations  tenant failures and increased vacancies during the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization is partially offset by depreciation recorded on algonquin commons after the change in control transaction 
general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to an increase in payroll and related items as a result of additional staff 
general and administrative costs increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due to increased payroll and related items as a result of additional staff  increased acquisition costs related to properties acquired during as well as costs incurred for properties we did not acquire and increased professional fees 
interest expense increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of  on our mortgages payable  which includes algonquin commons for the year ended december   as compared to only six months of expense during the year ended december  and additional interest on mortgages payable of the properties owned through our joint venture with ipcc  while they were consolidated 
additionally  the amortization of loan costs increased related to the fees in connection with the refinance of the unsecured credit facilities in june  as well as the fees for the amendments completed during the year ended december  partially offsetting this increase in interest expense is a decrease in interest on our convertible notes as a result of the repurchases during and and decreased interest expense on our unsecured line of credit due to lower interest rates charged on the outstanding balance 
interest expense increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to increased interest rates charged on our unsecured credit facilities as a result of refinancing them earlier in interest on our unsecured facilities increased approximately  this increase is partially offset by a decrease in interest on our mortgages payable  due to lower balances maintained during the year 
our mortgage payable balance as of december  was higher than the balance as of december   due to mortgage loans closed during the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for asset impairment of  related to two consolidated properties that we anticipate selling at prices below their current carrying amount and  to record our investment in three development joint ventures at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for asset impairment of  related to five development joint venture projects  to reflect the investments at fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for asset impairment of  of this amount   related to basis differences recorded for interest costs incurred for certain development projects and  related to one consolidated investment property and a portion of another 
both properties were sold at prices below our current carrying value and required adjustments

development joint ventures our development joint ventures with four independent partners were designed to take advantage of what we believe are the unique strengths of each development team  while potentially diversifying our risk 
our development partners identified opportunities  assembled and completed the entitlement process for the land  and gauged national big box retailer interest in the location before bringing the project to us for consideration 
we contributed financing  leasing  and property management expertise to enhance the productivity of the new developments and are typically entitled to earn a preferred return on our portion of invested capital 
within the prevailing economic environment  a number of retailers have delayed new store openings until market conditions substantially improve 
in light of this marketplace reality  we have extended delivery dates for these projects and we will not have the ability to estimate the project completion dates until activity resumes 
as a result of the project delays  we have been required to record significant impairment losses related to these projects during the years ended december   and in conjunction with these impairment losses  we were required to write down our investment in certain projects to zero as we determined that it was not likely we would recover our invested capital from future cash flows of each project 
to provide clarity as to the current status of our development projects  we have divided them into two categories  active projects and land held for future development 
the projects considered active projects are savannah crossing in aurora  illinois  north aurora phase i in north aurora  illinois  and southshore shopping center in boise  idaho 
construction is essentially complete at savannah crossing and southshore shopping center is a redevelopment of an existing building 
the remaining development properties are categorized as land held for future development 
these include north aurora phases ii and iii in north aurora  illinois  shops at lakemoor in lakemoor  illinois  and lantern commons in westfield  indiana 
we will deploy capital for construction or improvements to development properties only when we have signed commitments from retailers and cannot be sure of their exact nature or amounts until that time

table of contents non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities in which the reit holds an interest  which nareit has further elaborated to exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
the following table reflects our ffo for the periods presented  reconciled to net income loss attributable to common stockholders for these periods for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net income loss attributable to common stockholders gain on sale of investment properties gain loss from change in control of investment properties impairment of depreciable operating property equity in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures amortization on in place lease intangibles amortization on leasing commissions depreciation  net of noncontrolling interest funds from operations attributable to common stockholders net income loss attributable to common stockholders per weighted average common share basic and diluted funds from operations attributable to common stockholders  per weighted average commons share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted distributions declared  common distributions per common share items impacting ffo gain on extinguishment of debt provision for asset impairment impairment of investment securities provision for asset impairment included in equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures tax benefit expense related to current impairment charges  net of valuation allowance other non cash adjustments 
table of contents ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  and gains loss on non operating property 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we believe ebitda is an important supplemental non gaap measure 
we utilize ebitda to calculate our interest expense coverage ratio  which equals ebitda divided by total interest expense 
we believe that using ebitda  which excludes the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  all of which are based on historical cost and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  facilitates comparison of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  particularly in light of the use of ebitda by a seemingly large number of reits in their reports on forms q and k 
we believe that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required us gaap measures of our performance to improve their understanding of our operating results

table of contents impact of recent accounting principles the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu aimed at increasing the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements by requiring comprehensive income to be reported in either a single statement or in two consecutive statements reporting net income and other comprehensive income 
the asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholder s equity 
however  the amendments do not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income or the us gaap requirement to report reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to net income on the face of the financial statements 
the asu requires retrospective application 
the guidance will be required to be implemented by us beginning january  management does not anticipate that the impact of this pronouncement will have a significant impact on the financial statements as it is aimed at providing additional information and enhancing presentation and disclosure 
inflation certain long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
subsequent events reference is made to note  subsequent events to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our subsequent event disclosures  which is incorporated into this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument is designed to reduce that exposure 
gains or losses related to the derivative financial instrument would be deferred and amortized over the terms of the hedged instrument 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
during the year ended december  we entered into an interest rate swap contract  as a requirement under a  secured mortgage 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
these variable rate loans are based on libor  therefore  fluctuations in libor will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting this debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans which are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing or extension based on our view of the current interest rate environment 
reference is made to note  secured and unsecured debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our total debt outstanding as of december   which is incorporated into this item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness  fixed rate debt that matures and needs to be refinanced and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
at december   approximately  or  of our debt has variable interest rates averaging 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on debt containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately  for the year ended december  equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in equity prices 
our exposure to changes in equity prices is a result of our investment in securities 
at december   our investment in securities  classified as available for sale  totaled  the carrying values of investments in securities subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the date of the consolidated balance sheets 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  therefore  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from any number of factors including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
additionally  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
we do not engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our equity price risk 
other than temporary impairments on our investment in securities were  for the year ended december  no such impairments were required or recorded for the years ended december  and we believe that our investments will continue to generate dividend income and  as the stock market recovers  we have begun to recognize gains on sale
