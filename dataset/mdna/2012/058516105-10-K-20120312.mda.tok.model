corporate wide restructuring in the fourth quarter of  the board of directors and management of the company approved a corporate wide strategic initiative to refocus our worldwide digital equipment distribution business  services platform and cinema screen manufacturing business

s as theatre exhibition companies continued to convert their theatre complexes to digital based projection equipment 
sales of lamps rose to million from million in while sales of servers rose to million from million a year ago 
we also continued to integrate projection equipment in our omaha plant for a large exhibition customer 
revenues generated from the accessories we sell with the integration services increased to million in from million in we do expect this integration business to substantially decline after fiscal due to the exhibition customer s digital conversion being substantially completed 
screen product sales revenues from the sale of screens decreased to million in compared to million a year ago primarily due to lower demand for digital d screens 
sales were at record levels in as exhibition companies pushed to capture the relative new d movie box office during the period 
we sell screens for both digital cinema and film applications 
in some instances  a screen can be used interchangeably with either a digital projector or a film projector 
however  there are certain digital d applications such as the technology by reald that require special silver screens that we manufacture 
film product sales the transition to digital cinema has impacted sales of film equipment  accessories and replacement parts and these products are expected to further decline in future periods

foreign revenues foreign revenues primarily from the theatre segment fell to million from million in resulting in large part to sales volume in mainland china decreasing to million from million in the results out of china reflect increased competition and the shifting of scheduled installations due to changing theatre construction timelines 
however  we believe there are future growth opportunities in china going forward and we continue to allocate resources to add sales and service offices throughout the mainland 
we also experienced lower sales volume in south america  canada  mexico and europe 
the results were primarily due to the timing of the digital cinema rollout in these countries coupled with lower sales of film equipment 
export sales are sensitive to worldwide economic and political conditions that can lead to volatility 
certain areas of the world are more cost conscious than the us market and there are instances where our products are priced higher than local manufacturers making it more difficult to generate sufficient profit to justify selling into these regions

gross profit consolidated gross profit increased to million from million in but as a percent of total revenue decreased to from in gross profit in the theatre segment increased to million from million in but as a percentage of theatre sales decreased to from a year ago 
the higher gross profit was due to the increase in sales volume while the decline in gross margin is reflective of higher sales of digital products which carry substantially higher revenue price points but lower gross margins than our other products and services

the majority of the increase in digital sales resulted from sales of digital projectors and certain accessories  however  sales of digital lamps also rose from million in to million in while sales of digital servers rose to million from million in we also began to integrate projection equipment in our omaha plant where we consolidate and test digital equipment

the increased demand in china resulted from theatres chains retrofitting their current operations with digital equipment as well as the growth of new theatre complexes

table of contents consolidated receivables at december   respectively 
while the company believes its relationships with such customers are stable  most arrangements are made by purchase order and are terminable at will by either party 
a significant decrease or interruption in business from the company s significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company could also be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic and political conditions in each of the countries in which the company sells its products 
financial instruments that potentially expose us to a concentration of credit risk principally consist of accounts receivable 
we sell product to a large number of customers in many different geographic regions 
to minimize credit concentration risk  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition or use letters of credit 
hedging and trading activities the company s primary exposure to foreign currency fluctuations pertains to its subsidiary in canada 
in certain instances  the company may enter into foreign exchange contracts to manage a portion of this risk 
for the period ended december   the company had recorded approximately million of realized and unrealized losses associated with these contracts in its consolidated statement of operations

there were no other material contractual obligations other than inventory and property  plant and equipment purchases in the ordinary course of business 
seasonality generally  our business exhibits a moderate level of seasonality 

table of contents legal see note to the consolidated financial statements  and item of this report  for a description of legal matters 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net revenues or profitability 
historically  we have been able to offset any inflationary effects by either increasing prices or improving cost efficiencies 
current year adoption of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion regarding our adoption of accounting pronouncements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc  comprehensive income  by requiring all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the guidance is effective retrospectively for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which defers certain portions of asu no 
indefinitely and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following circumstances are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable collectability is reasonably assured 
table of contents we recognize revenue when these criteria have been met and when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
if an arrangement involves multiple deliverables  the delivered items are considered separate units of accounting if the items have value on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of their fair values 
revenues from the arrangement are allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their objectively determined fair value 
for services  revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered 
unbilled revenue represents revenue recognized in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy for which the invoice has not been processed and sent to the customer 
costs related to revenues are recognized in the same period in which the specific revenues are recorded 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are reported in revenue 
shipping and handling costs incurred by the company are included in cost of sales 
estimates used in the recognition of revenues and cost of revenues include  but are not limited to  estimates for product warranties  price allowances and product returns 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market and include appropriate elements of material  labor and overhead 
our policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable values are management s estimates related to customer demand and the development of new technology  which could make our theatre and lighting products obsolete  among other items 
management has managed these risks in the past and believes that it can manage them in the future  however  operating margins may suffer if they are unable to effectively manage these risks 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
we use an estimate of our annual effective rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances at the time while the actual effective rate is calculated at year end 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing whether the deferred tax assets are realizable management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
if it would be determined that some or all of these assets would not be realized  valuation reserves would be required which would have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we follow the guidance in asc income taxes as it pertains to uncertain tax positions 
the guidance requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two step process  whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 
our uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant taxable authorities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we market our products throughout the united states and the world 
as a result  we could be adversely affected by such factors as changes in foreign currency rates and weak economic conditions 
as a majority of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar can and sometimes has made our products less competitive in foreign markets 
interest rates we have a variable interest rate credit facility  however  we have no outstanding balances as of december  if we would borrow up to the maximum amount available under these facilities  a one percent increase in the interest rate would increase interest expense by million per annum 
interest rate risks from our other interest related accounts such as our postretirement obligations are not deemed significant 
we currently have long term notes receivables bearing interest rates of and are recorded at fair market value 
a change in long term interest rates for comparable types of instruments would have the effect of us recording changes in fair value through our statement of operations 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are primarily related to our china and canadian subsidiaries 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with forecasted transactions 
at december   we had outstanding canadian foreign currency forward contracts to sell million canadian at fixed prices which will settle during the first quarter of a portion of our cash in the china and canadian subsidiaries is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million
