item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the company reported a net income to holders of common stock of million or per share in compared to a net loss to holders of common stock of million or per share in and a net loss of million or per share in the net loss was impacted by a writedown of the company s pipeline assets in the amount of million 
the company also recorded a million non cash unrealized gain on derivatives 
net of both the non cash impairment and the non cash unrealized gain on derivatives the company would have recorded an adjusted net income of million 
the company realized revenues of million in compared to million in and million in revenues increased million from of which million related to a per barrel increase in oil prices in kansas as prices averaged per barrel in compared to per barrel in during  increases in sales volumes primarily from drilling and polymers contributed million in revenues over levels 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in methane project revenues 
the average price received for kansas oil sales in was gas prices received for sales of gas from the swan creek field averaged per mcf in  per mcf in  and per mcf in oil prices received for sales of oil from the swan creek field averaged in  per barrel in  and per barrel in production costs and taxes were million in  million in  and million in the increases in and were primarily related to increases in well repair and maintenance cost in kansas  increased kansas property taxes  and increased methane project costs 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization for was million  million in  and million in these increases related primarily to higher oil and gas depletion expense 
the company s general and administrative cost was million in and and was million in the  and cost included non cash charges related to stock options of million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense was million in  million in  and million in during  the company recorded a million loss on derivatives 
the loss was comprised of a million unrealized gain  offset by million of settlement payments made to macquarie bank limited macquarie pursuant to a hedging agreement it entered into with macquarie in august see  item a  commodity risk 
during  the company recorded a million gain on derivatives 
the gain was comprised of a million unrealized gain partially offset by million of settlement payments made to macquarie 
in  the company recorded a million unrealized loss on derivatives 
during  the company recorded a million million net of tax effect non cash writedown of its pipeline asset 
this writedown resulted from the company s assessment that cash flows generated from the pipeline were insufficient to recover the pipeline s net book value 
during the fourth quarter of the company received expressions of interest from potential purchasers of the pipeline asset which were significantly below the asset s pre writedown net book value of million 
these expressions of interest indicated that the carrying amount of the pipeline may not be recoverable 
the company recorded income tax expense of million in  an income tax benefit of million in  and an income tax benefit of million in the tax expense in was impacted by removal of the million valuation allowance 
had this valuation allowance not been removed the company would have recorded tax expense of million in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had a revolving credit facility with f m bank trust company f m bank 
under the credit facility  loans and letters of credit are available to the company on a revolving basis in an amount outstanding not to exceed the lesser of million or the company s borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s producing and non producing oil and gas properties and pipeline and the company s methane project assets 
the credit facility includes certain covenants with which the company is required to comply 
these covenants include leverage  interest coverage  minimum liquidity  and general and administrative coverage ratios 
during and  the company was in compliance with all covenants 
on july   the company and f m bank entered into an amendment to the credit facility which increased the borrowing base from million to million  set the interest rate to the greater of prime plus or per annum  eliminated the monthly commitment reduction  and changed the maturity date to january  on february   the company and f m bank entered into an amendment to the credit facility which increased the borrowing base from million to million  increased the maximum line of the company s credit amount from million to million  and extended the term of the facility to january  on july  f m bank reaffirmed the company s borrowing base at million 
the total borrowings outstanding under the facility at december  and were million and million respectively 
the company believes that cash flows and availability under the credit facility will allow the company to fully fund its operations 
the next borrowing base review will take place in june although the company has not been required as of the date of this report to make any payment of principal to f m bank under the borrowing base in effect at any time  the company can make no assurance that in view of the conditions in the national and world economies  including the realistic possibility of low commodity prices being received for the company s oil and gas production for extended periods  that f m may in the future make a redetermination of the company s borrowing base to a point below the level of the installment or other payments to f m in such amount and at such times in order to reduce the principal of the company s outstanding borrowing to a level not in excess of the borrowing base as it may be redetermined 
during and  the company focused on increasing its oil production and carefully used its cash flow and available credit to do so 
however  the company can make no assurance that it can continue normal operations indefinitely or for any specific period of time in the event of extended periods of low commodity prices  such as occurred in late and early  or upon the occurrence of any significant downturn or losses in operations 
in such event  the company may be required to reduce costs of operations by various means  including not undertaking certain maintenance or reworking operations that may be necessary to keep some of the company s properties in production or to seek additional working capital by additional means such as issuance of equity including preferred stock or such other means as may be considered and authorized by the company s board of directors from time to time 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher oil prices and increased sales volumes 
cash flow provided by working capital was million in  cash flow used for working capital was million in and million in net cash used in investing activities was million in  in  and million in the increases were primarily due to higher levels of drilling and polymer activity 
also  during  the company spent million of additional capital installing an electric generator at the methane facility 
in addition  the company was required to make million of derivative settlement payments to macquarie as well as a million payment to cargill incorporated cargill to purchase a floor see item a 
commodity risk for a discussion of the agreement with cargill 
in  million was provided by financing activities from bank funding which was used primarily to fund drilling and polymer activities during in  million of cash was used in financing activities related primarily to the company entering into a sweep account arrangement allowing excess cash balances to be used to temporarily pay down the credit facility  thereby  reducing overall interest cost 
in no cash was provided by or used in financing activities 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the company s financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized based on actual volumes of oil and gas sold to purchasers at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
crude oil is stored and at the time of delivery to the purchasers  revenues are recognized 
natural gas meters are placed at the customer s location and usage is billed each month 
there were no material natural gas imbalances at december  full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property acquisition  exploration  and development activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in connection with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
capitalized costs include lease acquisitions  seismic surveys  drilling  completion  and estimated asset retirement costs 
the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated asset retirement costs  which are not already included net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the company has determined its reserves based upon reserve reports provided by laroche petroleum consultants ltd 
in   and the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company currently has million in unevaluated properties as of december  proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties are accounted for as reductions to capitalized costs unless such sales cause a significant change in the relationship between costs and the estimated value of proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
at the end of each reporting period  the company performs a ceiling test on the value of the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties 
this test compares the net capitalized cost capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes to the present value of estimated future net revenues from oil and gas properties using an average price arithmetic average of the beginning of month prices for the prior months and current cost discounted at plus cost of properties not being amortized and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the cost being amortized ceiling 
prior to the year ending december   the ceiling was calculated using the year end price 
oil and gas reserves depletion depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  plus estimated future development costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of costs relating to proved reserves and estimated costs of plugging and abandonment  net of estimated salvage value  are amortized on the unit of production method based on total proved reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated  subject to an annual assessment of whether impairment has occurred 
the company s proved oil and gas reserves as of december  were determined by laroche petroleum consultants  ltd 
projecting the effects of commodity prices on production  and timing of development expenditures includes many factors beyond the company s control 
the future estimates of net cash flows from the company s proved reserves and their present value are based upon various assumptions about future production levels  prices  and costs that may prove to be incorrect over time 
any significant variance from assumptions could result in the actual future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates 
asset retirement obligations the company s asset retirement obligations relate to the plugging  dismantling and removal of wells drilled to date 
the company follows the requirements of fasb asc  asset retirement obligations and environmental obligations 
among other things  fasb asc requires entities to record a liability and corresponding increase in long lived assets for the present value of material obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
over the passage of time  accretion of the liability is recognized as an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depleted over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
the company s asset retirement obligations relate primarily to the plugging  dismantling and removal of wells drilled to date 
the company s calculation of asset retirement obligation used a credit adjusted risk free rate of  when the original liability for wells drilled prior to was recognized 
in  the retirement obligations were recognized using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
the retirement obligations for new wells drilled in january through july were recognized using a credit adjusted risk free rate of 
the retirement obligations for new wells drilled after july were recognized using a credit adjusted risk free rate of the company used an estimated useful life of wells ranging from years and an estimated plugging and abandonment cost of  per well in kansas and  per well in tennessee 
these costs are escalated annually using the average of the year and year treasury rates 
at december  theses rates averaged 
management continues to periodically evaluate the appropriateness of these assumptions 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the guidance clarifies the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and changes particular principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption was not permitted 
the company does not believe the changes have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
balance sheet topic  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this guidance requires entities to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transaction subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangements 
this guidance is effecting for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the change and will make the necessary disclosures when required by the guidance 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations due by period as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total year year year long term debt obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest on long term debt obligations total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas production 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable and price volatility is expected to continue 
monthly oil price realizations ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during gas prices realizations ranged from monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
in order to help mitigate commodity price risk  the company has entered into a long term fixed price contract for mmc gas sales 
on august   the company entered into a five year fixed price gas sales contract with atmos energy marketing  llc  aem in houston  texas  a nonregulated unit of atmos energy corporation nyse ato for the sale of the methane component of landfill gas produced by mmc at the carter valley landfill 
the agreement provides for the sale of up to mmbtu per day 
the contract is effective beginning with september gas production and ends july  the agreed contract price of over per mmbtu was a premium to the then current five year strip price for natural gas on the nymex futures market 
in addition  the company has a remaining derivative agreement on a specified number of barrels of oil that currently constitutes approximately half of the company s daily production that ends on december  on july   the company entered into a two year agreement on crude oil pricing applicable to a specified number of barrels of oil that then constituted approximately two thirds of the company s daily production 
due to increased production levels  as well as a drop in the specified monthly barrels from  to  in  this number of barrels constituted less than half of the company s average daily production at july  as of august  the costless collar agreement has expired  however  the company entered into an alternative hedging arrangement described below 
the credit facility maturity date of january  is based on the march  amendment to the credit agreement this costless collar agreement was effective august  through july  and had a per barrel floor and per barrel cap on a volume of  barrels per month during the period from august  through december   and  barrels per month from january  through july  the prices referenced in this agreement were wti nymex 
while the agreement was based on wti nymex prices  the company receives a price based on kansas common plus bonus  which results in a price approximately per barrel less than current wti nymex prices 
under the costless collar agreement  no payment was made or received by the company  as long as the settlement price was between the floor price and cap price within the collar 
however  if the settlement price was above the cap  the company was required to pay the counterparty an amount equal to the excess of the settlement price over the cap times the monthly volumes hedged 
if the settlement price was below the floor  the counterparty was required to pay the company the deficit of the settlement price below the floor times the monthly volumes hedged 
as of august  the costless collar agreement had expired 
on june  the company entered into an agreement with cargill  for the period from august  through december  the agreement provides to the company a per barrel floor on a stated quantity of  barrels per month  which is approximately half of the company s current production of oil 
if the average price falls below per barrel  then cargill will pay to the company the difference between and the lower average price for  barrels per month in each month during when such lower average prices occur 
however  unlike the costless collar arrangement  the company will not have a price cap on any portion of its production volumes 
the cost of the cargill agreement to the company  which was paid on june   was per barrel per month or a total of  for the entire period of the agreement 
these agreements were primarily intended to help maintain and stabilize cash flow from operations if lower oil prices return 
if lower oil prices return  the cargill agreement may allow the company to maintain production levels of crude oil by enabling the company to perform some ongoing polymer or other workover treatments on then existing producing wells in kansas 
interest rate risk at december   the company had debt outstanding of approximately million including  as of that date  million owed on its credit facility with f m bank 
the interest rate on the credit facility is variable at a rate equal to the greater of prime rate plus  or per annum 
the company s remaining debt of million has fixed interest rates ranging from to 
as a result  the company annual interest cost in fluctuated based on short term interest rates on approximately of its total debt outstanding at december  during  the company paid approximately million of interest on the f m bank line of credit 
the impact on interest expense and the company s cash flows of a increase in the interest rate on the f m bank credit facility would be approximately million assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remained at the same amount owed as of december  the company did not have any open derivative contracts relating to interest rates at december  forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent upon certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control  and which would cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  the market prices of oil and gas  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties of foreign governments  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks  including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can also affect these risks 
additionally  fluctuations in oil and gas prices  or a prolonged period of low prices  may substantially adversely affect the company financial position  results of operations and cash flows
