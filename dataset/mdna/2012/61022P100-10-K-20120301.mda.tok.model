item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and on contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our technologies and fonts 
whenever possible  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our suppliers  partners and others to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 

table of contents we apply for us and international patents with respect to our technologies  and seek copyright registration of our software and us and international trademark registration in those instances in which we determine that it is competitively advantageous and cost effective to do so 
we have been granted a total of ten patents and have fourteen patents pending with the us patent and trademark office 
our most important patents are related to our subpixel rendering technology and act technology 
we have unregistered trademarks and  where appropriate  registered trademarks on the key fonts in our font libraries 
we intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark rights 
some of our fonts are owned by third parties that we license under exclusive and non exclusive agreements 
we have also collaborated with third parties in the production and development of fonts 
competition our text imaging solutions compete with those offered by a variety of companies  including vendors of laser printer and display imaging technologies  printer drivers and providers of fonts 
we compete principally on the basis of our technical innovation  engineering and customer support expertise  the breadth of our font offerings and the overall performance of our text imaging solutions  including reliability and timely delivery 
competition with our solutions comes from a variety of sources  including companies that license technologies and fonts  like adobe and bitstream  and local providers of text imaging solutions that offer solutions specific to a particular country s language requirements 
we also compete with freetype  an open source collaborative organization that provides its linux font rendering code for free  with printer driver provider software imaging and with extensis and insider software with respect to our fontexplorerx product 
the competition for our fonts and custom font design services generally comes from companies offering their own typeface libraries and custom typeface services  including adobe  zoran  bitstream  font foundry websites  font related websites and independent professionals 
we also compete with in house resources of our oem customers 
employees and consultants at december   we employed persons 
in addition  we have an exclusive relationship with a consulting firm that provides font design and production services in china 
the table below provides our employees by functional area 
number of employees percentage sales and marketing research and development general and administration total none of our employees or consultants is represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
our linotype employees are represented by a work council 
this work council has the right to participate in certain decisions by linotype  including operational changes  such as relocation of the business or change of control transactions  and social matters such as wages and salaries and working hours 
we believe that our relations with our employees and consultants are good

risks related to our customers and our customer relationships we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of licensees  and if we are unable to maintain these customer relationships or attract additional customers  our revenue will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from the licensing of our text imaging solutions to oems 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
accordingly  if we are unable to maintain these relationships or establish relationships with new customers  our licensing revenue will be adversely affected 
in addition  some of our license agreements are for a limited period of time and  upon expiration of their license agreements  these oems may not renew their agreements or may elect not to enter into new agreements with us on terms as favorable as our current agreements 
if hewlett packard or adobe were to discontinue their use of our text imaging solutions in their products  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
because of their market position as industry leaders  the incorporation by hp of our text imaging solutions in its laser printers and the incorporation of our text imaging solutions by adobe in its postscript product promote widespread adoption of our technologies by manufacturers seeking to maintain compatibility with hp and adobe 
if hp or adobe were to stop using our text imaging solutions in their 
table of contents products  the market acceptance of our technologies by other ce device manufacturers would be materially and adversely affected  and this would in turn adversely affect our revenue 
we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees and  to the extent we lower them in the future  our revenue may be adversely affected 
the ce device markets are highly competitive and ce device manufacturers are continually looking for ways to reduce the costs of components included in their products in order to maintain or broaden consumer acceptance of those products 
because our technologies are a component incorporated into ce devices  when negotiating renewals of customer contracts  we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees 
we have in the past  and may in the future  need to lower our license fees  either immediately or over time  to preserve customer relationships or extend use of our technology to a broader range of products 
to the extent contractual license fees for any particular customer are lower in the future  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve related increases in the use of our technologies or other benefits to fully offset the effects of these adjustments 
if we are unable to further penetrate our existing markets or adapt or develop text imaging solutions  our business prospects could be limited 
we expect that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully penetrate existing markets for ce devices  including laser printers  digital copiers  mobile phones  e book readers  tablets  automotive displays  digital cameras  navigation devices  digital televisions  set top boxes and consumer appliances 
to date  we have penetrated only some of these markets 
our ability to grow our revenue depends upon our ability to further penetrate these markets and to successfully penetrate those markets in which we currently have no presence 
demand for our text imaging solutions in any of these developing markets may not develop or grow  and a sufficiently broad base of oems and creative professional customers may not adopt or continue to use products that employ our text imaging solutions 
because of our limited experience in some of these markets  we may not be able to adequately adapt our business and our solutions to the needs of these customers 
in addition  we have traditionally licensed our technologies and fonts to oems that embed our technology in their platforms  which means our ability to expand in some markets is dependent on the success of our oem customers to expand in those markets 
our success depends on the existence of a market for ce devices that incorporate our text imaging solutions 
our revenue depends in large part on market demand for text imaging solutions that enable ce devices to render high quality text 
the ce device market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and needs  and frequent new platform and product introductions 
if the need for laser printers and other ce devices utilizing our technology were to decrease or if current models of these products were replaced by new or existing products for which we do not have a competitive solution or if our solutions are replaced by others that become the industry standard and we are not able to develop technologies to build on such industry standards  our customers may not purchase our solutions and our revenue would be adversely affected 
for example  if graphical device interface  or gdi  printers increased their already dominant position and replaced more page description language  or pdl  printers  our revenue would be adversely affected 
similarly  if the android platform  for example  increases market share in the mobile phone industry and we are not able to develop solutions to build on such platform  our revenue would be adversely affected 
the market for text imaging solutions for laser printers is a mature market growing at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate 
to the extent that sales of laser printers level off or decline  our licensing revenue may be adversely affected 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenue in  and was derived from laser printer manufacturers 
the laser printer market is a mature market and as a result  it has grown at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate 
in both and  the laser printer market experienced a decline and our revenue was adversely affected 
if sales of printers incorporating our text imaging solutions level off  or decline  then our licensing revenue may be adversely affected 
our licensing revenue depends in large part upon oems incorporating our text imaging solutions into their products and if our solutions are not incorporated in these products or fewer products are sold that incorporate our solutions  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our licensing revenue from oems depends upon the extent to which these oems embed our technologies in their products 
we do not control their decision whether or not to embed our solutions into their products  and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts 
if we fail to develop and offer solutions that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace  oems may not be willing to embed our solutions into their products 
the process utilized by oems to design  develop  produce and sell their products is generally to months in duration 
as a result  if an oem is unwilling or unable to embed our solutions into a product that it is manufacturing or developing  we may experience significant delays in generating revenue while we wait for that oem to begin development of a new product that may embed our solutions 
in addition  if oems sell fewer products incorporating our solutions  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon an increase or decrease of market share by ce device manufacturers to whom we license our text imaging solutions 
the terms of our license agreements with our ce device manufacturers vary 
for example  we have fixed fee licensing agreements with certain customers  some of which may decline over time 
if these customers  some of whom are instrumental in setting industry standards and influencing early adoption of platforms or technology incorporating our text imaging solutions  were to increase their share of the ce device market  under the terms of these agreements there would not be a corresponding increase in our revenue 
any change in the market share of ce device manufacturers to whom we license our text imaging solutions is entirely outside of our control 
risks related to our text imaging solutions if we fail to develop and deliver innovative text imaging solutions in response to changes in our industry  including changes in consumer tastes or trends  our revenue could decline 
the markets for our text imaging solutions are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution and are intensely competitive and price sensitive 
we will need to expend considerable resources on product development in the future to continue to design and deliver enduring and innovative text imaging solutions 
we rely on the introduction of new or expanded solutions with additional or enhanced features and functionality to allow us to maintain our royalty rates in the face of downward pressure on our royalties resulting from efforts by ce device manufacturers to reduce costs 
despite our efforts  we may not be able to develop and effectively market new text imaging solutions that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace 
in addition  we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities 
our future success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to develop and deliver innovative text imaging solutions that are widely adopted in response to changes in our industry  that are compatible with the solutions introduced by other participants in our industry and for which the ce device manufacturers are willing to pay competitive royalties 
our failure to deliver innovative text imaging solutions that allow us to stay competitive and for which we can maintain our royalty rates would adversely affect our revenue 

table of contents open source software may make us more vulnerable to competition because new market entrants and existing competitors could introduce similar products quickly and cheaply 
open source refers to the free sharing of software code used to build applications in the software development community 
individual programmers may modify and create derivative works and distribute them at no cost to the end user 
to the extent that open source software that has the same or similar functionality as our technologies is developed or gains market share  demand for our text imaging solutions may decline  we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our text imaging solutions and our results of operations may be negatively affected 
current and future industry standards may limit our business opportunities 
various industry leaders have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for ce devices that incorporate  or have the potential to incorporate  our text imaging solutions 
although we have made some efforts to have our text imaging solutions adopted as standards by industry market leaders  these efforts have been limited and we do not control the ultimate decision with respect to whether our solutions will be adopted as industry standards in the future or  to the extent they are adopted  whether and for how long they will continue as such 
if industry standards adopted exclude our solutions  we will lose market share and our ability to secure the business of oems subject to those standards will be adversely affected 
costs or potential delays in the development of our solutions to comply with such standards could significantly increase our expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to others who comply faster or in a more cost efficient way or those whose solutions are adopted as the industry standard 
we may also need to acquire or license additional intellectual property rights from third parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  and we may be required to license our intellectual property to third parties for purposes of standards compliance 
the success of our business is influenced by the interoperability of our text imaging solutions with a variety of ce devices and software applications and operating systems 
to be successful we must design our text imaging solutions to interoperate effectively with a variety of ce devices  software applications  operating systems and content creation platforms 
we depend on the cooperation of ce device manufacturers with respect to the components integrated into their devices  such as pdls  as well as software developers that create the operating systems and applications  to incorporate our solutions into their product offerings 
content creation platforms are evolving rapidly 
to the extent our fonts and font technologies are less relevant  or incompatible  our business would be adversely affected 
our text imaging solutions compete with solutions offered by some of our customers  which have significant competitive advantages 
we face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors 
for example  adobe is a significant licensee of our text imaging solutions  but adobe is also a competitor with respect to the licensing of technologies and fonts 
to the extent that adobe or our other customers choose to utilize competing text imaging solutions they have developed or in which they have an interest  rather than utilizing our solutions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
adobe also offers broader product lines than we do  including software products outside of the text imaging solutions markets that provide adobe with greater opportunities to bundle and cross sell products to its large user base 
to the extent our customers were to offer text imaging solutions comparable to ours at a similar or lower price  our revenue could decline and our business would be harmed 
our business is dependent in part on technologies and fonts we license from third parties and these license rights may be inadequate for our business 
certain of our text imaging solutions are dependent in part on the licensing and incorporation of technologies from third parties  and we license a substantial number of fonts from third parties 
for 
table of contents example  we have entered into license agreements with agfa gevaert nv under which we have acquired rights to use certain color technology 
we also have license agreements with microsoft  adobe and others under which we license certain fonts 
our license agreements with these parties are limited by the ownership or licensing rights of our licensors 
if any of the technologies we license from third parties fail to perform as expected  if our licensors do not continue to support any of their technology or intellectual property  including fonts  because they go out of business or otherwise  or if the technologies or fonts we license are subject to infringement claims  then we may incur substantial costs in replacing the licensed technologies or fonts or fall behind in our development schedule and our business plan while we search for a replacement 
in addition  replacement technology and fonts may not be available for license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  which could subject us to claims by our customers for breach of the terms of our agreements with them 
certain component technologies in our text imaging solutions may be subject to open source licenses  which may restrict how we use or distribute our technologies or require that we release the source code of certain technologies subject to those licenses 
certain open source licenses  such as the gnu lesser general public license  require that source code subject to the license be released or made available to the public 
such open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary technologies  when combined in specific ways with open source software  become subject to the open source license 
we take steps to ensure that our proprietary technologies are not combined with  or do not incorporate  open source software in ways that would require our proprietary technologies to be subject to an open source license 
however  few courts have interpreted the open source licenses  and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty 
while our end user license agreement  or eula  prohibits the use of our technologies in any way that would cause them to become subject to an open source license  our oem customers could  in violation of our eula  combine our technologies with technologies covered by an open source license 
in addition  we rely on multiple software engineers to design our proprietary text imaging solutions 
although we take steps to ensure that our engineers do not include open source software in the technologies they design  we may not exercise complete control over the product development efforts of our engineers and we cannot be certain that they have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary technologies 
in the event that portions of our proprietary technologies are determined to be subject to an open source license  we might be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code  which could reduce or eliminate our ability to commercialize our text imaging solutions 
also  our ability to market our text imaging solutions depends in part on the existence of proprietary operating systems 
if freely distributed operating systems like linux become more prevalent  the need for our solutions may diminish and our revenue could be adversely affected 
finally  in the event we develop technologies that operate under or are delivered under an open source license  such technologies may have little or no direct financial benefit to us 
our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands  and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brands  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
maintaining and strengthening the monotype  linotype and ascender brands  the fonts 
com  linotype 
com  ascenderfonts 
com  itcfonts 
com  fontmarketplace 
com and webfonts 
fonts 
com brands  the fontexplorerx brand  as well as the brands of our fonts  such as helvetica and itc avant garde  is critical to maintaining and expanding our business  as well as to our ability to enter into new markets for our text imaging solutions 
if we fail to promote and maintain these brands successfully  our ability to sustain and expand our business and enter into new markets will suffer 
maintaining and strengthening our brands will depend heavily on our ability to continue to develop and provide innovative and high quality solutions for our customers  as well as to continue to maintain our strong online presence 
if we fail to maintain high quality standards  if we fail to meet industry standards  or if we introduce text imaging solutions that our customers or potential 
table of contents customers reject  the strength of our brands could be adversely affected 
further  unauthorized third parties may use our brands in ways that may dilute or undermine their strength 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we could lose our intellectual property rights  which could negatively affect our revenue or dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to protect our intellectual property  including our fonts 
to protect our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of united states and international patents  design registrations  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret restrictions  eulas  and the implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
despite these efforts  we may be unable to effectively protect our proprietary rights and the enforcement of our proprietary rights may be extremely costly 
for example  our ability to enforce intellectual property rights in the actual design of our fonts is limited 
we hold patents related to certain of our rasterizer and compression technologies and registered trademarks on many of our fonts 
our patents may be challenged or invalidated  patents may not issue from any of our pending applications or claims allowed from existing or pending patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength or may not issue in the countries where products incorporating our technology may be sold to provide meaningful protection or be of any commercial advantage to us 
some of our patents have been and or may be licensed or cross licensed to our competitors 
we rely on trademark protection for the names of our fonts 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and distribute our proprietary technologies and fonts 
also  many applications do not need to identify our fonts by name  such as those designs embedded in mobile telephones and set top boxes  and therefore may not need to license trademarked fonts 
we sometimes protect fonts by copyright registration but we do not always own the copyrights in fonts licensed from third parties 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to enforce our copyrights against a third party who independently develops fonts even if it generates font designs identical to ours 
our eula generally permits the embedding of our fonts into an electronic document only for the purpose of viewing and printing the document  but technologies  including those related to web based fonts  may exist or may develop which allow unauthorized persons who receive such an embedded document to use the embedded font for editing the document or even to install the font into an operating system  the same as if the font had been properly licensed 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property or copying of our fonts may dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
also  we may be unable to generate revenue from products that incorporate our text imaging solutions without our authorization 
monitoring unauthorized use of our text imaging solutions is difficult and expensive 
a substantial portion of the ce devices that require text imaging solutions are manufactured in china 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be effective  particularly in countries like china where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights 
disputes and litigation regarding the ownership of technologies and fonts and rights associated with text imaging solutions  such as ours  are common  and sometimes involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence 
third parties have from time to time claimed  and in the future may claim  that our products and services infringe or violate their intellectual property rights 
any such claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and  if successfully asserted against us  could require that we pay substantial damages and prevent us from selling our products 
we may be forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine 
table of contents the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners pursuant to any such litigation  which could further exhaust our resources 
furthermore  as a result of an intellectual property challenge  we may be required to enter into royalty  license or other agreements  and we may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us 
we have been in the past involved in litigation with third parties  including adobe  to defend our intellectual property rights and have not always prevailed 
risks related to our business operations a prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business 
our ability to generate revenue is affected by the level of business activity of our oem and creative professional customers  which  in most cases  is affected by the level of economic activity occurring in the industries and markets that our customers serve 
negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from a recession  the availability of credit  actual or threatened military action by the united states  terrorist attacks on the united states or abroad or increased oil prices  could cause a decrease in consumer and or business spending on computer hardware and software and ce devices in general and could negatively affect the rate of growth of ce device markets or of adoption of ce devices 
any economic downturn  including a reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general  could also adversely affect the demand for fonts or impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services that they have purchased 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery and this uncertainty makes it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future 
if the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen from present levels  the demand for fonts and font technologies could decline and our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely impacted 
software licensing models are evolving and if we are not able to make our fonts and font technologies available under these models  our business prospects could suffer 
new licensing and business models are evolving in the software industry 
for example  a company may provide software applications  data and related services over the internet  using primarily advertising or subscription based revenue models sometimes known as cloud computing 
recent advances in computing and communications technologies  and specifically a growth in the demand for web based fonts that integrate seamlessly with all web browsers and operating systems  have made this model viable 
as software licensing models evolve  we may not be successful in adapting to these new business models and our business prospects could suffer 
we face significant competition in various markets  and if we are unable to compete successfully  our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer 
we face significant competition in the text imaging solutions markets 
we believe that our most significant competitive threat comes from companies that compete with some of our specific offerings 
those competitors currently include adobe  bitstream  software imaging  extensis  insider software  freetype  and local providers of text imaging solutions whose products are specific to a particular country s language 
we also compete with the internal development efforts of certain of the ce device manufacturers to whom we license our solutions  most of which have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
similarly  we also face competition from font foundries  font related websites and independent professionals 
some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  may enjoy greater name recognition than we do or may have 
table of contents more experience or advantages than we have in the markets in which they compete 
these advantages may include  among others sales and marketing advantages  advantages in the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel  advantages in the establishment and negotiation of profitable strategic  distribution and customer relationships  advantages in the development and acquisition of innovative software technology and the acquisition of software companies  greater ability to pursue larger scale product development and distribution initiatives on a global basis  substantially larger patent portfolios  and operational advantages 
further  many of the devices that incorporate our text imaging solutions also include technologies and fonts developed by our competitors 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to enhance our text imaging solutions and introduce new high quality solutions to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures 
our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer if we fail to do so successfully 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside north america and  as a result  we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business 
we have offices in five foreign countries and we are dedicating a significant portion of our sales efforts in countries outside north america 
we are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from operations outside the u 
s and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
this future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our text imaging solutions  including the licensing of our technologies and fonts worldwide 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights  especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that the united states does  which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our text imaging solutions  united states and foreign government trade restrictions  including those that may impose restrictions on importation of programming  technology or components to or from the united states  foreign government taxes  regulations and permit requirements  including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the united states  and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the united states  risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate of the japanese yen  the european union s euro  and the united kingdom s pound sterling  including risks related to hedging activities we may undertake  foreign labor laws  regulations and restrictions  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  
table of contents difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  natural disasters  war and or events of terrorism  and the strength of international economies 
if we have difficulty finding appropriate partnership and or acquisition candidates  our ability to execute aspects of our strategic plan may be hindered 
we intend to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions  strategic partnerships and third party intellectual property licenses to accelerate our time to market  penetrate new geographies and expand our offering 
execution of our strategy relies on finding and closing partnerships and or acquisitions that fit with our business and that meet our financial expectations 
to the extent that we are unable to identify appropriate opportunities and close deals on acceptable financial terms  we may face hurdles in executing portions of our strategy 
in addition  the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying  investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions  whether or not they are consummated 
if we do find appropriate acquisition candidates  the acquisition process may divert our management s attention or result in additional dilution to stockholders or use of resources that are necessary to operate other parts of our business 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire businesses  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with such acquisitions  incurrence of acquisition related costs  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions 
in addition  we could discover deficiencies withheld from us in an acquisition or otherwise not uncovered in our due diligence prior to the acquisition 
these deficiencies could include problems in internal controls  product quality  customer relationships or compliance with applicable laws  any of which could result in us becoming subject to unforeseen liabilities 
moreover  a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  which must be assessed for impairment at least annually 
in the future  if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns  we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process  which could harm our results of operations 
acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or in the incurrence of debt  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations  our operating results may suffer 
we rely on the manufacturers to whom we license our text imaging solutions to accurately prepare royalty reports for our determination of licensing revenue and if these reports are inaccurate  our revenue may be under  or over stated and our forecasts and budgets may be incorrect 
our license revenue is generated primarily from royalties paid by ce device manufacturers who license our text imaging solutions and incorporate them into their products 
under these arrangements  
table of contents these licensees typically pay us a specified royalty for every consumer hardware device they ship that incorporates our text imaging solutions 
we rely on our licensees to accurately report the number of units shipped 
we calculate our license fees  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets and direct our licensing and technology development efforts based in part on these reports 
however  it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not our licensees are reporting shipments accurately 
we understand that ce device manufacturers in specific countries have a history of underreporting or failing to report shipments of their products 
we have implemented an audit program of our licensees records  but the effects of this program may be limited as audits are generally expensive and time consuming and initiating audits could harm our relationships with licensees 
in addition  our audit rights are contractually limited 
to the extent that our licensees understate or fail to report the number of products incorporating our text imaging solutions that they ship  we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled 
alternatively  we may encounter circumstances in which an oem customer may notify us that it previously reported and paid royalties on units in excess of what the customer actually shipped 
in such cases  we may be required to give our licensee a credit for the excess royalties paid which would result in a reduction in revenue in the period in which a credit is granted  and such a reduction could be material 
parties from whom we license text imaging solutions may challenge the basis for our calculations of the royalties due to them 
some of our agreements with licensors require us to give them the right to audit our calculations of royalties payable to them 
in addition  licensors may at any time challenge the basis of our calculations and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our defense 
any royalties paid as a result of any successful challenge would increase our expenses and could negatively impact our relationship with such licensor  including by impairing our ability to continue to use and re license technologies or fonts from that licensor 
we incur significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with changing laws and regulations  including those affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
we have incurred and will incur significant costs  and have and could experience internal resources constraints  associated with the evaluation of and compliance with evolving corporate governance  reporting and other requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act and the massachusetts data protection laws  as well as rules implemented by the sec  and the nasdaq global select market 
the expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing 
we expect that the rules and regulations applicable to us could cause our legal and financial compliance costs to increase and could make some activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  in the current public company environment officers and directors are subject to increased scrutiny and may be subject to increased potential liability 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 
this could negatively impact our future success 
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly 
we expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
the revenue we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions  demand for ce devices that include our text imaging solutions  demand for our fonts and custom font design services  delays in product shipment by our customers  industry consolidation  
table of contents introduction  enhancement and market acceptance of text imaging solutions by us and our competitors  price reductions by us or our competitors or changes in how text imaging solutions are priced  the mix of text imaging solutions offered by us and our competitors  the mix of international and us revenue generated by our solutions  financial implications of acquisitions  in particular foreign acquisitions involving different accounting standards  foreign currency issues  international tax planning requirements and the like  timing of billings to customers on royalty reports received by us under our licensing agreements  and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is based on actual shipments by our customers of products incorporating our text imaging solutions in the preceding quarter  and not on contractually agreed upon minimum revenue commitments 
because the shipping of products by our customers is outside our control and difficult to predict  our ability to accurately forecast quarterly revenue is limited 
our revenue also varies from quarter to quarter as a result of variances on the timing of transactions through our e commerce websites 
quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may  in turn  cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
the loss of key members of our senior management team may prevent us from executing our business strategy 
our future success depends in large part upon the continued services of key members of our senior management team 
all of our executive officers and key employees are at will employees 
douglas j 
shaw  chief executive officer  has been with the company in various senior management roles for years 
mr 
shaw has been critical to the overall management of the company  as well as the development of our solutions  our culture and our strategic direction 
the loss of his services or of the services of other key members of our senior management could seriously harm our ability to execute our business strategy 
we also may have to incur significant costs in identifying  hiring  training and retaining replacements for key employees 
we rely on highly skilled personnel  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals  including font designers who are recognized as leaders in the industry and experienced software engineers 
these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to us and our operations 
these individuals can be terminated or can leave our employ at any time 
some of these individuals are consultants 
if any of these individuals or a group of individuals were to terminate their employment unexpectedly or end their consulting relationship sooner than anticipated  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors  could incur significant costs in connection with their termination and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled personnel and consultants for all areas of our organization 
in this regard  if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified employees and consultants for any reason or retain employees or consultants with the required expertise  we may not be able to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively or execute our business strategy successfully 

table of contents risks related to the securities markets and investment in our common stock the structure of our current credit facility could affect our financing options and liquidity 
we have a five year  million secured revolving credit facility with wells fargo capital finance llc the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon  at the company s option  either london interbank offering rate  libor or the base rate  plus in each case  an applicable margin 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in the event that we draw down on the credit facility more fully  it could have important consequences to our business or the holders of our common stock  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  requiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures  and preventing us from paying dividends on our common stock 
market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  most of which we cannot control  including announcements of new products  services or technologies  commercial relationships  acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in our financial guidance or securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in accounting principles  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders  additions or departures of key personnel  discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities  general market or economic conditions  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors  and other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors 
market prices of technology companies have been extremely volatile 
stock prices of many technology companies have often fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in the past  following periods of market volatility  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation 
if we were involved in securities litigation  it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may inhibit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us 
although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development  operation and expansion of our business and the repayment of indebtedness  and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
moreover  our credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends 
we may require additional capital  and raising additional funds by issuing securities or additional debt financing may cause dilution to existing stockholders  restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any new debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations more than our current credit facility 
these restrictive covenants would likely include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends or make investments

overview we are a leading global provider of text imaging solutions 
our end user and embedded solutions for print  web and mobile environments enable people to create and consume dynamic content on any and every device 
our technologies and fonts enable the display and printing of high quality digital content 
our software technologies have been widely deployed across  and embedded in a range of ce devices  including laser printers  digital copiers  mobile phones  e book readers  tablets  automotive displays  digital cameras  navigation devices  digital televisions  set top boxes and consumer appliances  as well as in numerous software applications and operating systems 
in the laser printer market  we have worked together with industry leaders for over years to provide critical components embedded in printing standards 
the company also provides printer drivers  page description language interpreters  printer user interface technology and color imaging solutions to printer manufacturers and oems original equipment manufacturers 
our scaling  compression  text layout  printer driver and color technologies solve critical text imaging issues for ce device manufacturers by rendering high quality text on low resolution and memory constrained ce devices 
we combine these proprietary technologies with access to more than  typefaces from a library of some of the most widely used designs in the world  including popular names such as helvetica and times new roman 
we also license our typefaces to creative and business professionals through our e commerce websites including fonts 
com  linotype 
com  ascenderfonts 
com  itcfonts 
com and webfonts 
fonts 
com  which attracted more than million visits in from over countries and territories  direct and indirect sales and custom font design services 
on november   we entered into a definitive agreement with bitstream to acquire bitstream s font business in an all cash merger valued at million  subject to adjustments based on the net asset value of bitstream 
the transaction has been approved by the boards of directors for both companies 
we anticipate financing the deal through a combination of cash balances and our secured revolving credit facility 
on january  we received a voluntary request for information from the united states department of justice the doj regarding the pending transaction 
the doj also informed monotype imaging that it will likely issue a civil investigative demand cid to monotype imaging pursuant to the antitrust civil process act of we expect the transaction to close following the resolution of the doj inquiry  as well as the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  the approval of the transaction by bitstream s shareholders  and the spinoff by bitstream of its mobile browsing and variable data publishing businesses 

table of contents on december   we acquired ascender corporation  a privately held font provider with long standing relationships with several leading brands including google and microsoft  located in elk grove village  illinois  and font commerce llc for approximately million 
of the purchase price  approximately million was paid in cash and million  or  shares  in common stock were issued 
we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  topic no 
 business combinations  or asc the majority of the common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was issued to shareholders of ascender  who immediately upon closing became employees of the company 
the stock awards granted are subject to vesting terms that require employment to continue over our standard four year term 
as a result  approximately million of the million in common stock issued is being expensed as share based compensation over the four year vesting term 
at the acquisition date  the company had a pre existing relationship with ascender  an exclusive licensing agreement with a fair value equivalent to its book value of million that was effectively settled on acquisition 
in accordance with asc  the settlement of the license was included as part of total consideration and has been allocated among the assets acquired 
sources of revenue we derive revenue from two principal sources licensing our text imaging solutions to ce device manufacturers and independent software vendors  which we refer to as our oem revenue  and licensing our fonts to creative and business professionals  which we refer to as our creative professional revenue 
we derive our oem revenue primarily from ce device manufacturers 
we derive our creative professional revenue primarily from multinational corporations  graphic designers  media organizations  advertisers  printers and publishers 
some of our revenue streams  particularly custom revenue where spending is largely discretionary in nature  have historically been and we expect them to continue to be in the future  susceptible to weakening economic conditions 
in  we experienced a decrease in printer imaging royalty revenue from asia primarily a result of the natural disaster in japan in march  which we do not expect to occur in our customers are located in the united states  asia  europe and throughout the rest of the world  and our operating subsidiaries are located in the united states  japan  the united kingdom  germany and hong kong 
we are dependent on international sales by our foreign operating subsidiaries for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
revenue from our asian subsidiaries is generally from asian customers and revenue from our other subsidiaries is from customers in a number of different countries  including the united states 
we attribute revenue to geographic areas based on the location of our subsidiary receiving such revenue 
for example  licenses may be sold to a large international company headquartered in korea  but the sale is received and recorded by our subsidiary located in the united states 
in this example  the revenue would be reflected in the united states totals in the table below 
sales of total sales of total sales of total in thousands of dollars  except united states asia united kingdom germany total for the years ended december   and  sales by our subsidiaries located outside north america comprised  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
in revenue from the united states increased both in dollars and as a percent of revenue  as a result of several factors  contractual changes with an existing customer  growth in markets primarily served by our us subsidiary and our acquisition of ascender 
we expect that sales by our international subsidiaries will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our text imaging solutions worldwide 

table of contents we derive a majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers  in particular manufacturers of laser printers and mobile phones 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in  or cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties  allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs directly related to custom design services 
license fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our oem and creative professional revenue and do not involve minimum fees 
our cost of oem revenue is typically lower than our cost of creative professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our oem customers  provide value added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume 
the cost of our custom design service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue and  as a result  our gross margin varies from period to period depending on the level of custom design revenue recorded 
cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology  which we amortize over to years 
for purposes of amortizing acquired technology we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations  including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it 
we use the straight line method to amortize our acquired technology 
there is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern  and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage 
gross profit our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix  pricing and volume at any particular time 
however  our cost of oem revenue is typically lower than our cost of creative professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our oem customers  provide value added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume 
within our creative professional business  the cost of our custom design service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue 
as a result  our gross profit varies from period to period depending on the mix between  and within  oem and creative professional revenue 
marketing and selling our marketing and selling expense consists of salaries  bonuses  commissions and benefits related to our marketing and selling personnel  business travel expenses  advertising and trade show expenses  web related expenses  allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses 
sales commission expense varies as a function of revenue and goal achievement from period to period 
during  our marketing and selling expenses increased  as compared to  mainly due to an increase in personnel related expenses and an increase in discretionary spending in areas such as travel and tradeshows  consulting and advertising 
research and development our research and development expense consists of salaries  bonuses and benefits related to our research and development  engineering  font design and integration support personnel and their business travel expenses  license fees related to certain of our technology licenses  expenses for contracted services and allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses 
our research and development expense in a given period may be reduced to the extent that internal engineering resources are allocated to cost of revenue for custom design services 

table of contents our research and development is primarily focused on enhancing the functionality of our text imaging solutions and developing new products 
from time to time we license third party font technology in connection with new technology development projects that are part of our research and development efforts 
our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
general and administrative our general and administrative expense consists of salaries  bonuses and benefits related to our general and administrative personnel  accounting  legal and other professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses and insurance costs 
restructuring on november   the company implemented a restructuring plan 
under the restructuring plan  the company reduced headcount in certain areas and redeployed certain other employees within the company in order to focus on key initiatives across the business 
the headcount reduction was intended to be offset by the hiring of a few key additional employees whose technical expertise was better aligned with our key initiatives  and accordingly we did not experience an overall change in headcount 
the restructuring plan was completed in april  other than making deferred cash payments to certain terminated employees 
the company implemented a restructuring plan on october   which included certain actions that were taken during the three months ended september  in advance of finalizing the plan 
under the restructuring plan  the company reduced headcount in an effort to improve operational efficiencies  primarily within the creative professional area of our business  and consolidated certain functions of our european operations within our united states and united kingdom offices 
the plan provided for the elimination of positions worldwide 
the company recorded charges of approximately million for severance and termination benefits associated with this plan 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  of restructuring costs for severance and termination benefits for both plans  which is included in our operating expenses 
this restructuring plan was completed in the first quarter of  other than the payment of deferred termination benefits to certain terminated employees 
future cash expenditures related to the restructuring are expected to be approximately thousand  net of tax savings 
amortization of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets acquired as follows customer relationships to years  acquired technology to years  and non compete agreements to years 
for purposes of amortization  we estimate the life of customer relationships based upon various considerations  including our knowledge of the industry and the marketplace in which we operate 
we amortize non compete agreements over the stated life of the agreement 
we use the straight line method to amortize our intangible assets 
there is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern  and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in 
table of contents our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our critical accounting policies may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements in item revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic no 
 revenue recognition  or asc revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
oem revenue our oem revenue is derived substantially from per unit royalties received for printer imaging and printer driver  or printer products  and display imaging products 
under our licensing arrangements we typically receive a royalty for each product unit incorporating our text imaging solutions that is shipped by our oem customers 
we also receive oem revenue from fixed fee licenses with certain of our oem customers 
fixed fee licensing arrangements are not based on units the customer ships  but instead  customers pay us on a periodic basis for use of our text imaging solutions 
although significantly less than royalties from per unit shipments and fixed fees from oem customers  we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors  who include our text imaging solutions in their products  and for font development 
many of our per unit royalty licenses continue for the duration that our oem customers ship products that include our technology  unless terminated for breach 
other licenses have terms that typically range from three to five years  and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals 
we recognize revenue from per unit royalties in the period during which we receive a royalty report from a customer  typically one quarter after royalty bearing units are shipped 
revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized when it is billed to the customer  so long as the product has been delivered  the license fee is fixed and non refundable and collection is probable 
creative professional revenue our creative professional revenue is derived from font licenses and from custom font design services 
we license fonts directly to end users through our e commerce websites  via telephone  email and indirectly through third party resellers 
we also license fonts and provide custom font design services to graphic designers  advertising agencies  media organizations and corporations 
we refer to direct  indirect and custom revenue  as non web revenue  and refer to revenue that is derived from our websites  as web revenue 
revenue from font licenses to our e commerce customers is recognized upon payment by the customer and electronic shipment of the software embodying the font 
revenue from font licenses to other customers is recognized upon shipment of the software embodying the font and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue from resellers is recognized upon notification from the reseller that our font product has been licensed and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
custom font design services are generally recognized upon delivery 
contract accounting may be used where services are deemed essential to the software 
goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets 
table of contents acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we allocate the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to goodwill 
the value initially assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  particularly intangible assets and goodwill  are subject to underlying assumptions that require significant management judgment 
if different assumptions were used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of december st 
in september  the fasb issued an update to asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  testing for goodwill impairment asc 
asc provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary 
specifically  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
in  we assessed qualitative factors  as described below  to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was impaired and determined that the fair value was more likely than not higher than its carrying value 
with respect to both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  a sustained decrease in share price or current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful lives and future cash flows  including assumptions about future conditions such as future revenue  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
if this resulted in an impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc topic no 
 compensation stock compensation or asc  which requires the measurement of compensation costs at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we valued awards granted based on the grant date closing price of our common stock as traded on the nasdaq global select market 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted and recognizes the compensation cost of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards using the black scholes model are affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate volatility by using a blend of our stock price history  for the length of time we have market data for our stock and the historical volatility of similar public companies for the remainder of the expected term of each grant 
this is estimated in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method  as defined in sab the risk free interest rate assumption is based on a us treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of our awards 
the expected dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of paying no dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation expense recognized in our financial 
table of contents statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded total share based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the company had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested stock options and restricted share awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
pension plan we account for our defined benefit pension plan in accordance with asc subtopic no 
 defined benefit plans pension 
our unfunded defined benefit pension plan was acquired in connection with our acquisition of linotype on august  the plan covers substantially all employees of our linotype subsidiary who joined linotype prior to april   at which time the pension plan was closed to new participants 
benefits under this plan are based on the employees years of service and compensation 
we fund the plan sufficiently to meet current benefits only 
there are no assets associated with the plan 
in and we paid thousand and thousand  respectively  to the plan participants 
at december  and  our unfunded position was million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of the pension benefit obligation is determined based on the rate of future compensation increases  inflation and interest rates 
given the fact that the pension plan is unfunded  changes in economic and market conditions may require us to increase cash contributions in future years 
in addition  changes to our assumptions may materially impact the accrued pension liability 
provision for income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
 income taxes  or asc under this method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by enacted tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to be reversed 
this process includes estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery to be unlikely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  including foreign tax credits  where we have determined that their future use is uncertain 
asc requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carry back and carry forward periods  existing sales backlog  future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies 
we have historically provided valuation allowances on certain tax assets  due to the uncertainty 
table of contents of generating taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction and of the appropriate character to realize such assets 
in these instances  the company has made the determination that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax will not be realized 
we will continue to review our deferred tax position on a periodic basis and will reflect any change in judgment as a discrete item in the related period 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved  or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing the future impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the tax effect of these temporary differences is shown on our december  consolidated balance sheet see note to our consolidated financial statements and denotes these differences as a net deferred tax liability of million 
this consists of total deferred tax liabilities of million and net deferred tax assets of million after providing a valuation allowance of million 
derivative financial instruments we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
all changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized as current period income or expense unless specific hedge criteria are met  which requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting at the inception of each instrument 
we recorded our derivatives at fair value  which is determined based on the provisions of asc topic no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures  using either quoted market prices or prices for similar instruments 
the determination of fair value of our derivatives considers our non performance risk and that of our counterparties

recently issued accounting pronouncements goodwill impairment in september  the fasb issued an update to asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  testing for goodwill impairment asc 
asc provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary 
specifically  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the update was intended to simplify how an entity tests for goodwill impairment 
this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted this standard effective with our fiscal year end december  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc topic no 
 comprehensive income  which amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a single statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement  or a separate 
table of contents statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement 
companies will no longer be allowed to present comprehensive income on the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
in both options  companies must present the components of net income  total net income  the components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income 
in addition  in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
the provisions of both pieces of new guidance are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and will require retrospective application for all periods presented 
the adoption will impact the presentation of comprehensive income  but will not otherwise impact our financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the years ended december   and since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operations  private and public stock sales and long term debt arrangements  as described below

the transaction is expected to close following the resolution of the doj inquiry  as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions 
we anticipate financing the deal through a combination of cash balances and our secured revolving credit facility 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents  our current debt arrangements and our cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings

significant variations in operating cash flows frequently occur because  from time to time  our customers make prepayments against future royalties 
prepayments may be required under the terms of our license agreements and are occasionally made on an elective basis and often cause large fluctuations in accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
the timing and extent of such prepayments significantly impact our cash balances

adjusted ebitda as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense  interest expense  net  the provision benefit for income taxes and share based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability  particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure 
we have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
we have a significant amount of debt  and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
we generally incur significant us federal  state and foreign income taxes each year and the provision benefit for income taxes is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
share based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements 
non cash expenses  restructuring  issuance and cash non operating expenses have a meaningful impact on our financial statements 
therefore  their exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
as a result  adjusted ebitda should be evaluated in conjunction with net income loss for complete analysis of our profitability  as net income loss includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure to adjusted ebitda 
as adjusted ebitda is not defined by gaap  our definition of adjusted ebitda may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure

table of contents non gaap measure in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls  in addition to adjusted ebitda as discussed above  we discuss a key measure that is not calculated according to gaap 
this non gaap measure is net adjusted ebitda  which is defined as income loss from operations before depreciation  amortization of acquired intangible assets and share based compensation expenses 
we use net adjusted ebitda as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business 
we use net adjusted ebitda in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets  supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors  determining bonus compensation for our employees based on operating performance and evaluating short term and long term operating trends in our operations 
we believe that net adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our gaap results  while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance 
we believe that these non gaap financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision making 
we believe that trends in our net adjusted ebitda may be valuable indicators of our operating performance

for the years ended december   and  no customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
interest rate risk we use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate volatility resulting from our variable rate debt  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report under item asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  or asc  requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships  including a requirement that all designations must be made at the inception of each instrument 
as we did not make such initial designations  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are to be recognized as current period income or expense 
the fair value of derivative instruments is estimated based on the amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt 
the interest rate on our amended and restated credit agreement fluctuates with either the prime rate or the libor interest rate 
at december   the blended rate of interest on our outstanding debt was 
for each one percent increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase by million  however  this would be mitigated by our interest rate swap 
we purchase interest rate swap instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt obligations 
on may   we entered into a long term interest rate swap contract to pay a fixed rate of interest of in exchange for a floating rate interest payment tied to the one month libor beginning january the contract has a notional amount of million with a million reduction in the notional amount on january  and matures on july  the total fair value of the financial instrument at december  was a liability of approximately million 
in  and  we recognized losses of million  million and million  respectively  on our interest rate swap contracts which have been included in loss gain on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk in accordance with asc topic no 
 foreign currency matters  or asc  all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries to us dollars are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we also incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to certain customers that are invoiced in us dollars  but who have the option to make an equivalent payment in their own functional currencies at a specified exchange rate as of a specified date 
in the period from that date until payment in the customer s functional currency is received and converted into us dollars  we can incur realized gains and losses 
to mitigate our exposure we utilize forward contracts with maturities of days or less to hedge our exposure to these currency fluctuations 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate 
at december  and there were no currency contracts outstanding 
in addition  we incur foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses on an intercompany note with one of our foreign subsidiaries that is denominated in euros 
at december  the note balance was approximately million 
the effect of an immediate strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the euro would result in a million unrealized transaction loss on this note receivable which would be reported in loss gain on foreign exchange within our results of operations  however  this would be mitigated by our currency swap 
on may   we entered into a long term currency swap contract to purchase million euros in exchange for million to mitigate our exposure to currency fluctuation risk on this note 
the contract payment terms approximate the payment terms of this intercompany note and the notional amount is amortized down over time  as payments are made 
the total fair value of the currency swap instrument at december  and was million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred a loss of million  gain of million and a loss of million  respectively  on the currency swap contract which is included in loss gain on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the loss and gain on the intercompany note are included in loss gain on foreign exchange in the accompanying consolidated statements of income
