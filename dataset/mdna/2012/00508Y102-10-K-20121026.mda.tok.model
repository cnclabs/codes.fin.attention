from an overall market perspective  third party forecasts for the us non residential construction market  a key market for the company  remain favorable though estimates for growth vary significantly

accounting standards adopted in fiscal and accounting standards yet to be adopted see new accounting pronouncements footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on recently adopted and upcoming standards 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as discussed in the description of business and basis of presentation footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  share based compensation expense  medical  product warranty  and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management discusses the development of accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
see the summary of significant accounting policies footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting estimates revenue recognition the company records revenue when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the company s price to the customer is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the period of revenue recognition  provisions for certain rebates  sales incentives  product returns  and discounts to customers are estimated and recorded  in most instances  as a reduction of revenue 
the company also maintains one time or on going marketing and trade promotion programs with certain customers that require the company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs 
these items are estimated based on customer agreements  historical trends  and expected demand 
actual results could differ from estimates  which would require adjustments to accrued amounts 

table of contents accounts receivable the company records accounts receivable at net realizable value 
this value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect losses anticipated on accounts receivable balances 
the allowance is based on historical write offs  an analysis of past due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables  and economic status of customers  if known 
management believes that the allowance is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts  however  there can be no assurance that unanticipated future business conditions of customers will not have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
inventories inventories include materials  direct labor  in bound freight  and related manufacturing overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out or average cost basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter or on an interim basis  if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the long lived asset is below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with us gaap including  but not limited to  economic  industry  and company specific qualitative factors  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flows 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flows and or changes in the discount rate or theoretical royalty rate could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to record a non cash charge to earnings for the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position  but not its cash flows from operations 
goodwill the company is comprised of one reporting unit with a goodwill balance of the company utilized a qualitative assessment to determine the likelihood of impairment of goodwill as of june  to do this  the company identified and analyzed macroeconomic  industry  and company specific factors 
additionally  factors that most affect the fair value of the company were compared to those used in the previous year s impairment test to identify potentially significant variances to further support the reasonableness of the assumptions 
taking into consideration these factors  the company estimated the potential change in the fair value of goodwill compared with the previous year s impairment test 
as a result of this analysis  management believes the estimated fair value of the reporting unit continues to exceed its carrying value by a substantial margin and does not represent a more likely than not possibility of potential impairment 
the goodwill analysis did not result in an impairment charge 
indefinite lived intangible assets the company s indefinite lived intangible assets consist of five unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately management utilized significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows fair value model in accordance with us gaap 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
future net sales and short term growth rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on management s financial forecasts  which consider key business drivers  such as specific revenue growth initiatives  market share changes  
table of contents expected growth in non residential and residential construction markets  and general economic factors  such as credit availability and interest rates 
the long term growth rate used in determining terminal value is estimated at for the company and is based primarily on the company s understanding of projections for expected long term growth in non residential construction  the company s key market  and historical long term performance 
the theoretical royalty rate is estimated primarily using management s assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name and is compared with market information for similar intellectual property within and outside of the industry 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected future after tax cash flows in the valuation model 
the company utilized a range of estimated discount rates between and as of june   based on the capital asset pricing model  which considers the updated risk free interest rate  beta  market risk premium  and entity specific size premium 
during fiscal  the company performed an evaluation of the fair value of its five unamortized trade names 
the company s expected revenues are based on the company s fiscal expectations and recent lighting market growth estimates for fiscal through the company also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help the company improve performance 
during fiscal  estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between and 
the indefinite lived intangible asset analysis did not result in an impairment charge  as the fair values exceeded the carrying values for each trade name by a significant amount 
the estimated fair values of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceed the carrying values by such a significant amount that any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses  including revenue growth rates and the discount rate  would not cause the carrying values to exceed the estimated fair values as determined by the fair value analyses 
the company determined that any estimated potential impairment related to the trade names based on changes in the assumptions that would be less likely to occur would not be material to the company s financial results  trend of earnings  or financial position 
self insurance the company self insures  up to certain limits  traditional risks including workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
the company s self insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation  comprehensive general liability including product liability claims  and auto liability is limited to per occurrence of such claims

the estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including but not limited to the company s independent actuary 
the company is also self insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks  primarily physical loss to property per occurrence and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting two days or more in duration 
insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
the company is fully self insured for certain other types of liabilities  including environmental  product recall  warranty  and patent infringement 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions

the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans with individual claims limited to the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  plan design  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities  future expense and cash flow 
income taxes the company uses certain assumptions and estimates in determining the income taxes payable or refundable for the current year  income tax expense  and deferred income tax liabilities and assets  which represent temporary and permanent differences between amounts within the financial statements and the income tax basis 
accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes asc  requires the evaluation and testing of the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the relevant factors  it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
reasonable judgment and estimates are required in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and  if so  the amount of such valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers a number of factors  including  but not limited to the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  future reversals of existing temporary differences  
table of contents and the length of time carryovers can be utilized 
in light of the multiple tax jurisdictions in which the company operates  the company s tax returns are subject to routine audit by the internal revenue service irs and other taxation authorities 
the results of these audits at times produce uncertainty regarding particular tax positions taken in the year s of review 
the company records uncertain tax positions as prescribed by asc  which requires recognition at the time when it is more likely than not that the position in question will be upheld 
although management believes that the judgment and estimates involved are reasonable and that the necessary provisions have been recorded  changes in circumstances or unexpected events could adversely affect the company s financial position  results from operations  and cash flows 
retirement benefits the company sponsors domestic and international defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans and other postretirement plans 
assumptions are used to determine the estimated fair value of plan assets  the actuarial value of plan liabilities  and the current and projected costs for these employee benefit plans and include  among other factors  estimated discount rates  expected returns on the pension fund assets  estimated mortality rates  the rates of increase in employee compensation levels  and  for one international plan  retroactive inflationary adjustments 
these assumptions are determined based on company and market data and are evaluated annually as of the plans measurement date 
see the pensions and profit sharing plans footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s plans 
share based compensation expense the company recognizes compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument issued 
the company accounts for stock options  restricted shares  and share units representing certain deferrals into the director deferred compensation plan or the supplemental deferred savings plan both of which are discussed further in the share based payments footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements based on the grant date fair value estimated under the current provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the company employs the black scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of certain share based awards and records estimates of forfeitures of all share based awards at the time of grant  which are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods  estimated compensation expense may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period 
see the summary of significant accounting policies and share based payments footnotes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options 
product warranty and recall costs the company records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty or recall costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims 
the company is fully self insured for product warranty and recall costs 
historical warranty costs have been within expectations  however  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts or that using new technologies such as led products may not generate unexpected costs 
if actual future warranty or recall costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results and cash flow in future periods 
litigation the company recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved 
environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher or lower than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
the company is self insured for environmental matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the company is exposed to worldwide market risks that may impact the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  and consolidated statements of cash flows due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates as well as volatility in commodity prices 
the following discussion provides additional information regarding the market risks of acuity brands 
interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations expose the variable rate debt of the company to changes in interest expense and cash flows 
at august   the variable rate debt of the company was solely comprised of the long term industrial revenue bond 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have resulted in a de minimus amount of additional annual after tax interest expense 
a fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the company s fixed rate debt which includes the publicly traded fixed rate notes 
a increase in market interest rates at august   would have decreased the estimated fair value of these debt obligations by approximately see the debt and lines of credit footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for additional information regarding the company s debt 
foreign exchange rates 
the majority of net sales  expense  and capital purchases of the company are transacted in us dollars 
however  exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to the company s operations in mexico and canada  where a significant portion of products sold are sourced from the united states  and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
a hypothetical decline in the value of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar of as of august  would negatively impact operating profit by approximately  while a hypothetical appreciation of in the value of the canadian dollar in relation to the us dollar as of august  would favorably impact operating profit by approximately in addition to products and services sold in mexico  a significant portion of the goods sold in the united states are manufactured in mexico 
a hypothetical increase in the value of the mexican peso in relation to the us dollar as of august  would negatively impact operating profits by approximately  while a hypothetical decrease of in the value of the mexican peso in relation to the us dollar as of august  would favorably impact operating profit by approximately the individual impacts to the operating profit of the company of hypothetical currency fluctuations in the canadian dollar and mexican peso have been calculated in isolation from any potential responses to address such exchange rate changes in the company s foreign markets 
the company s exposure to foreign currency risk related to its operations in europe is immaterial and has been excluded from this analysis 
commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of raw materials and components in its production process including 
table of contents petroleum based products  steel  and aluminum 
in fiscal  the company purchased approximately  tons of steel and aluminum 
the company estimates that less than of the raw materials purchased are petroleum based and that approximately four million gallons of diesel fuel were consumed in fiscal failure to effectively manage future increases in the costs of these items could adversely affect the ability to maintain or increase operating margins
