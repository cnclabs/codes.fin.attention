item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of september   the company owned and operated restaurants and bars  fast food concepts and catering operations  exclusively in the united states  that have similar economic characteristics  nature of products and service  class of customer and distribution methods 
the company believes it meets the criteria for aggregating its operating segments into a single reporting segment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
accounting period our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest september we report fiscal years under a week format 
this reporting method is used by many companies in the hospitality industry and is meant to improve year to year comparisons of operating results 
under this method  certain years will contain weeks 
the fiscal years ended september  and october  included weeks 
reclassifications certain reclassifications of prior period balances have been made to conform to the current period presentation 
in connection with the planned or actual sale or closure of various restaurants  the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the company has reclassified its consolidated statement of income for the prior period presented 
these dispositions are discussed below in recent restaurant dispositions 
in addition  the company made minor reclassifications from common stock to additional paid in capital that did not impact results of operations  cash flows or earnings per share 
seasonality the company has substantial fixed costs that do not decline proportionally with sales 
the first and second fiscal quarters  which include the winter months  usually reflect lower customer traffic than in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
in addition  sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters can be adversely affected by inclement weather due to the significant amount of outdoor seating at the company s restaurants 
results of operations the company s operating income of  for the year ended september  increased compared to operating income of  for the year ended october  this increase resulted primarily from i significant improvements  due to mild weather conditions and an early spring  in the performance of our properties in the new york and washington  dc markets which was also negatively impacted by a flood in the third fiscal quarter of ii improving conditions in our other markets as a result of improved economic conditions  and iii improved menu costing  partially offset by pre opening and operating losses in the amount of approximately  related to our new restaurant in new york city  clyde frazier s wine and dine  which opened in march and a charge of  during the year ended september  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant 
the following table summarizes the significant components of the company s operating results for the years ended september  and october   respectively year ended variance september  october  in thousands revenues food and beverage sales other revenue total revenues costs and expenses food and beverage cost of sales payroll expenses occupancy expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses impairment loss from write down of ling lived assets n a depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses operating income revenues during the company s year ended september   revenues increased compared to the year ended october  this slight increase is primarily due to i significant improvements  due to favorable weather conditions and an early spring  in the performance of our properties in the new york and washington  dc markets which was also negatively impacted by a flood in the third fiscal quarter of  and ii revenues related to our new restaurant in new york city  clyde frazier s wine and dine  which opened in march  partially offset by the closure of both the grill room property located in new york and the america property located in washington  dc in the first quarter of fiscal and the food court operations at the mgm grand casino at the foxwoods resort casino in ledyard  ct in the second quarter of fiscal food and beverage same store sales on a company wide basis  same store food and beverage sales increased for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended october  as follows year ended variance september  october  in thousands las vegas new york washington  dc atlantic city  nj boston connecticut florida same store sales other food and beverage sales same store sales in las vegas increased by  in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of an overall increase in traffic in connection with a general improvement in economic conditions 
same store sales in new york increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of favorable weather conditions and an early spring as compared to the prior year 
same store sales in washington  dc which was negatively impacted by a flood in the third fiscal quarter of increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of favorable weather conditions and an early spring as compared to the prior 
same store sales in atlantic city increased by in fiscal compared to as result of new ownership at resorts casino hotel and their significant marketing efforts for the property 
same store sales in boston decreased during fiscal compared to as the location continued to suffer the negative impact of a fire that temporarily closed the property in the second fiscal quarter of same store sales in connecticut decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal as the property we operate at continues to attempt to attract new customers 
same store sales in florida during fiscal compared to were relatively flat as expected since the property has matured 
other food and beverage sales consist of sales related to new restaurants opened during the applicable period and sales related to properties that were closed during the period due to lease expiration and therefore not included in discontinued operations 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
other revenue the increase in other revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to an increase in purchase service fees 
costs and expenses costs and expenses from continuing operations for the years ended september  and october  were as follows in thousands year ended september  to total revenues year ended october  to total revenues increase decrease food and beverage cost of sales payroll expenses occupancy expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses impairment loss from write down of long lived assets n a depreciation and amortization food and beverage costs as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the year ended october  as a result of improved menu costing partially offset by higher commodity prices 
payroll expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the year ended october  as a result of higher than expected payroll at the sporting house in las vegas in the prior period combined with a reduction in payroll expenses related to properties that were closed due to lease expiration partially offset by payroll incurred at our new restaurant in new york city  clyde frazier s wine and dine  which opened in march occupancy expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the year ended october  as a result of a reduction in costs related to properties that were closed due to lease expiration partially offset by occupancy expenses incurred at our new restaurant in new york city  clyde frazier s wine and dine  which opened in march other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  remained static as compared to the year ended october  a slight increase in total costs were the result of the opening of clyde frazier s wine dine in march  partially offset by cost cutting measures implemented in the latter part of fiscal combined with a reduction in other operating costs and expenses related to properties that were closed due to lease expiration 
general and administrative expenses which relate solely to the corporate office in new york city as a percentage of total revenues for the year ended september  decreased as compared to the year ended october  as a result of cost cutting measures implemented in the latter part of fiscal partially offset by amounts recorded in connection with the former president s separation agreement 
during the year ended september   the company recorded a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant 
during the year ended october   the company recorded an impairment charge of  which represented the estimated fair value of the fixed assets  associated with its food court operations at the mgm grand casino at the foxwoods resort casino in ledyard  ct 
such amount has been reclassified to discontinued operations  along with operating losses of  net of tax  in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended october  interest expense was  in fiscal and  in fiscal interest income was  in fiscal and  in fiscal investments are made in government securities and investment quality corporate instruments 
other income  which generally consists other rentals and insurance proceeds  was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects federal income taxes calculated on a consolidated basis and state and local income taxes which are calculated on a separate entity basis 
most of the restaurants we own or manage are owned or managed by a separate legal entity 
for state and local income tax purposes  certain losses incurred by a subsidiary may only be used to offset that subsidiary s income  with the exception of the restaurants operating in the district of columbia 
accordingly  our overall effective tax rate has varied depending on the level of income and losses incurred at individual subsidiaries 
our overall effective tax rate in the future will be affected by factors such as the level of losses incurred at our new york city facilities which cannot be consolidated for state and local tax purposes  pre tax income earned outside of new york city and the utilization of state and local net operating loss carry forwards 
nevada has no state income tax and other states in which we operate have income tax rates substantially lower in comparison to new york 
in order to utilize more effectively tax loss carry forwards at restaurants that were unprofitable  we have merged certain profitable subsidiaries with certain loss subsidiaries 
the revenue reconciliation act of provides tax credits to us for fica taxes paid on tip income of restaurant service personnel 
the net benefit to us was  in both fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources our primary source of capital has been cash provided by operations 
we utilize cash generated from operations to fund the cost of developing and opening new restaurants  acquiring existing restaurants owned by others and remodeling existing restaurants we own 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was  compared to  for the prior year 
this net change was primarily attributable to the increase in operating income as discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  was  and resulted from net proceeds from the sales of investment securities offset by purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of clyde frazier s wine and dine in new york city 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended october  was  and resulted from net proceeds from the sales of investment securities and the inclusion of cash balances from vies in the amount of  partially offset by purchases of fixed assets at existing restaurants and the construction of the broadway burger bar located in the new york new york hotel casino in las vegas  nv 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of  was principally used for the payment of dividends  purchase of treasury stock and distributions to non controlling interests 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended october  of  was principally used for the payment of dividends and distributions to non controlling interests 
the company had a working capital surplus of  at september  as compared to a working capital surplus of  at october  we believe that our existing cash balances  investments and cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending requirements at least through the next months 
on december   april   june  and october  the company paid quarterly cash dividends in the amount of per share on the company s common stock 
the company intends to continue to pay such quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future  however  the payment of future dividends is at the discretion of the company s board of directors and is based on future earnings  cash flow  financial condition  capital requirements  changes in us taxation and other relevant factors in february  we entered into an amendment to the lease for the food court space at the new york new york hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada 
pursuant to this amendment  we agreed to  among other things  commit no less than  to remodel the food court 
in exchange for this commitment  the landlord agreed to extend the food court lease for an additional four years 
as of september   we have spent approximately  related to this commitment 
on june   we entered into a year exclusive agreement to manage a restaurant and catering service at basketball city in new york city in exchange for a fee of  all of which has been paid as of december  
under the terms of the agreement the owner of the property will construct the facility at their expense and we will pay the owner an annual fee based on sales  as defined in the agreement 
we expect to begin operating this property within the next months 
on november   we entered into an agreement to design and lease a restaurant at the tropicana hotel and casino in atlantic city  nj 
the initial term of the lease for this facility will expire years after the date the property first opens for business to the public following its current refurbishment and will have two five year renewals 
we anticipate the restaurant will open during the third quarter of the fiscal year 
restaurant expansion in august  we entered into an agreement to lease the former espn zone space at the new york new york hotel casino resort in las vegas and re open the space under the name the sporting house 
such lease is cancellable upon days written notice and provides for rent based on profits only 
this restaurant opened at the end of october and we did not invest significant funds to re open the space 
in the quarter ended january  we combined three fast food outlets located in the village eateries in the new york new york hotel casino resort in las vegas into a new restaurant  the broadway burger bar  which opened at the end of december on march   we entered into a lease agreement to operate a restaurant and bar in new york city named clyde frazier s wine and dine 
in connection with the agreement  the landlord has agreed to contribute up to  towards the construction of the facility of which  was received as of september   which totaled approximately  the initial term of the lease for this facility expires on march  and has one five year renewal 
this restaurant opened during the second quarter of fiscal and  as a result  the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  includes approximately  of pre opening and operating losses related to this property 
the opening of a new restaurant is invariably accompanied by substantial pre opening expenses and early operating losses associated with the training of personnel  excess kitchen costs  costs of supervision and other expenses during the pre opening period and during a post opening shake out period until operations can be considered to be functioning normally 
the amount of such pre opening expenses and early operating losses can generally be expected to depend upon the size and complexity of the facility being opened 
our restaurants generally do not achieve substantial increases in revenue from year to year  which we consider to be typical of the restaurant industry 
to achieve significant increases in revenue or to replace revenue of restaurants that lose customer favor or which close because of lease expirations or other reasons  we would have to open additional restaurant facilities or expand existing restaurants 
there can be no assurance that a restaurant will be successful after it is opened  particularly since in many instances we do not operate our new restaurants under a trade name currently used by us  thereby requiring new restaurants to establish their own identity 
we may take advantage of other opportunities we consider to be favorable  when they occur  depending upon the availability of financing and other factors 
recent restaurant dispositions and charges lease expirations in the first quarter of fiscal we were advised by the landlord that we would have to vacate the gonzalez y gonzalez property located in new york  ny  which was on a month to month lease 
the closure of this property occurred on january  on july   we entered into an agreement with the landlord of the grill room property located in new york city  whereby in exchange for a payment of  we vacated the property on october  such payment and the related loss on closure of the property  in the amount of  are included in other operating costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  this lease was scheduled to expire on december  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we were advised by the landlord that we would have to vacate the america property located in washington  dc  which was on a month to month lease 
the closure of this property occurred on november  the related loss on closure of this property  in the amount of  is included in other operating costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  discontinued operations effective march   we vacated our food court operations at the mgm grand casino at the foxwoods resort casino in ledyard  ct as we determined that we would not be able to operate this facility profitably at this location at the current rent 
as a result  we recorded a disposal loss in the amount of  which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal  as well as operating losses of  for the year ended september   all of which are included in discontinued operations  net of tax  in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended september  during the year ended october   we recorded an impairment charge of  which represented the estimated fair value of the fixed assets  associated with this property 
such amount  as well as operating losses of  is included in discontinued operations  net of tax  in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended october  during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we closed our pinch s mac operation located in new york city  and re concepted the location as polpette  which featured meatballs and other italian food 
sales at polpette failed to reach the level sufficient to achieve the results the company required 
on february   we closed this restaurant and on april  it was sold for  we realized a loss on the sale of  which was recorded during the second quarter of fiscal as well as operating losses of  for the year ended october   all of which are included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
other during the year ended september   the company recorded a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
while all these significant accounting policies impact our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements and require management to use a greater degree of judgment and estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe that given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any other reasonable judgments or estimate methodologies would cause a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows for the periods presented in this report 
below are listed certain policies that management believes are critical use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting estimates that require our most difficult and subjective judgments include allowances for potential bad debts on receivables  inventories  the useful lives and recoverability of our assets  such as property and intangibles  fair values of financial instruments and share based compensation  the realizable value of our tax assets and other matters 
because of the uncertainty in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including estimated future sales growth and estimated profit margins are included in this analysis 
management continually evaluates unfavorable cash flows  if any  related to underperforming restaurants 
periodically it is concluded that certain properties have become impaired based on their existing and anticipated future economic outlook in their respective markets 
in such instances  we may impair assets to reduce their carrying values to fair values 
estimated fair values of impaired properties are based on comparable valuations  cash flows and or management judgment 
during the year ended september   the company recorded a charge of  to impair the leasehold improvements and equipment of an underperforming restaurant 
based on the current facts and circumstances  the property does not meet the criteria for held for sale classification 
during the year ended october   the company recorded an impairment charge of  which represented the estimated fair value of the fixed assets  associated with this property 
such amount  as well as operating losses of  is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended october  leases we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including option periods as described below 
within the provisions of certain leases there are escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we would incur an economic penalty for not exercising the option 
percentage rent expense is generally based upon sales levels and is expensed as incurred 
certain leases include both base rent and percentage rent 
we record rent expense on these leases based upon reasonably assured sales levels 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the same lease terms for amortizing leasehold improvements as were used in calculating straight line rent expense for each restaurant 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different lease terms were used 
deferred income tax valuation allowance we provide such allowance due to uncertainty that some of the deferred tax amounts may not be realized 
certain items  such as state and local tax loss carryforwards  are dependent on future earnings or the availability of tax strategies 
future results could require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance and a resulting adjustment to income in such period 
goodwill and trademarks goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
trademarks  which were acquired in connection with the durgin park acquisition  are considered to have an indefinite life 
goodwill and trademarks are not amortized  but are subject to impairment analysis at least once annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
at september   the company performed both a qualitative and quantitative assessment of factors to determine whether further impairment testing is required 
based on the results of the work performed  the company has concluded that no impairment loss was warranted at september  qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and other relevant events  management expertise and stability at key positions 
additional impairment analyses at future dates may be performed to determine if indicators of impairment are present and  if so  such amount will be determined and the associated charge will be recorded to the consolidated statement of income 
share based compensation the company measures share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes it as expense over the applicable vesting period using the straight line method 
excess income tax benefits related to share based compensation expense that must be recognized directly in equity are considered financing rather than operating cash flow activities 
the fair value of each of the company s stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions that relate to the expected volatility of the company s common stock  the expected dividend yield of our stock  the expected life of the options and the risk free interest rate 
during fiscal  options to purchase  shares of common stock were granted and are exercisable as to of the shares commencing on the first anniversary of the date of grant and as to an additional commencing on the second anniversary of the date of grant 
the company did not grant any options during fiscal the company generally issues new shares upon the exercise of employee stock options 
recent developments on october   the company suffered a flood at its red and sequoia properties located in new york  ny as a result of a hurricane 
the company does not expect these properties to reopen as the underlying leases were due to expire in q of the company does not expect losses that are not covered by insurance proceeds to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on november   the company entered into an agreement to design and lease a restaurant at the tropicana hotel and casino in atlantic city  nj 
the initial term of the lease for this facility will expire years after the date the property first opens for business to the public following its current refurbishment and will have two five year renewals 
the company anticipates the restaurant will open during the third quarter of the fiscal year 
on november   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s common stock to be paid on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  subsequent to september   the company purchased of the members interests in ark hollywood tampa investment  llc for an aggregate consideration of  the company now owns of this partnership
