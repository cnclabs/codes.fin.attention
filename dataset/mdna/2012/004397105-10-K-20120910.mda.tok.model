if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted  causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  these risks and uncertainties may impact the forward looking statements described elsewhere in this form k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference 
they could affect our actual results of operations  causing them to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
risks related to our business if the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems do not achieve widespread market acceptance  we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
achieving physician  patient  hospital administrator and third party payor acceptance of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems as preferred methods of tumor treatment will be crucial to our continued success 
physicians will not begin to use or increase the use of the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and other factors  that the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are safe and effective alternatives to current treatment methods 
we often need to educate physicians about the use of stereotactic radiosurgery  igrt and adaptive radiation therapy  convince healthcare payors that the benefits of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and their related treatment processes outweigh their costs and help train qualified physicians in the skilled use of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
for example  the complexity and dynamic nature of stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic imrt as well as adaptive radiation therapy and igrt  require significant education of hospital personnel and physicians regarding the benefits of stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic imrt  as well as adaptive radiation therapy and igrt  and require departures from their customary practices 
we have expended and will continue to expend significant resources on marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic imrt as well as adaptive radiation therapy and igrt generally and to encourage the acceptance and adoption of our products for these technologies 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are major capital purchases  and purchase decisions are greatly influenced by hospital administrators who are subject to increasing pressures to reduce costs 
these and other factors  including the following  may affect the rate and level of market acceptance of each of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems price relative to other products or competing treatments  our ability to develop new products and enhancements and receive regulatory clearances and approval  if required  to existing products in a timely manner  effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts  the impact of the current economic environment on our business and our customer s business  including the postponement by our customers of purchase decisions or required build outs  capital equipment budgets of healthcare institutions  increased scrutiny by state boards when evaluating certificates of need requested by purchasing institutions  
table of contents perception by patients  physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems safety  efficacy  efficiency and benefits compared to competing technologies or treatments  publication in peer reviewed medical journals of data regarding the successful use and longer term clinical benefits of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  willingness of physicians to adopt new techniques and the ability of physicians to acquire the skills necessary to operate the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  extent of third party coverage and reimbursement rates  particularly from medicare  for procedures using the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  development of new products and technologies by our competitors or new treatment alternatives  regulatory developments related to manufacturing  marketing and selling the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems both within and outside the united states  perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products  and unfavorable publicity concerning the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems or radiation based treatment alternatives 
if the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems are unable to achieve or maintain market acceptance  new orders and sales of our systems would be adversely affected  our revenue levels would decrease and our business would be harmed 
we have a large accumulated deficit  may incur future losses and may be unable to achieve profitability 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur net losses in the future  particularly as we continue to increase our manufacturing  research and development  and marketing activities 
our ability to achieve and sustain long term profitability is largely dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and to control our costs and effectively manage our growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve profitability 
in the event we fail to achieve profitability  our stock price could decline 
if we are unable to provide the significant education and training required for the healthcare market to accept our products  our business will suffer 
in order to achieve market acceptance of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  we often need to educate physicians about the use of stereotactic radiosurgery and radiation therapy  convince healthcare payers that the benefits of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and their related treatment processes outweigh their costs and help train qualified physicians in the skilled use of these systems 
for example  the complexity and dynamic nature of stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic imrt as well as adaptive radiation therapy and igrt require significant education of hospital personnel and physicians regarding the benefits of stereotactic radiosurgery and robotic imrt as well as adaptive radiation therapy and igrt and require departures from their customary practices 
in addition  we also must educate clinicians regarding the entire functionality of our radiation therapy systems  including techniques using the full quantitative imaging capabilities of our treatment systems  which enable clinicians to adapt a patient s treatment plan in response to anatomical changes and the cumulative amount of radiation received by specific areas within the patient over the course of treatment 
we have expended and will continue to expend significant resources on marketing and educational efforts to create awareness of stereotactic radiosurgery  robotic imrt as well as adaptive radiation therapy and igrt and to encourage the acceptance and adoption of our products for these technologies 
we cannot be sure that any products we develop will gain significant market acceptance 
table of contents among physicians  patients and healthcare payors  even if we spend significant time and expense on their education 
failure to gain significant market acceptance would adversely affect our product sales and revenues  harming our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because the majority of our revenue is derived from sales of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  and because we experience a long and variable sales and installation cycle  our quarterly results may be inconsistent from period to period 
these fluctuations in revenue may make it difficult to predict our revenue 
our primary products are the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
we expect to generate substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future from sales of and service contracts for the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems have lengthy sales and purchase order cycles because they are major capital equipment items and require the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
selling our systems  from first contact with a potential customer to a complete order  generally spans six months to two years and involves personnel with multiple skills 
the sales process in the united states typically begins with pre selling activity followed by sales presentations and other sales related activities 
after the customer has expressed an intention to purchase a cyberknife or tomotherapy system  we negotiate and enter into a definitive purchase contract with the customer 
the negotiation of terms that are not standard for accuray may require additional time and approvals 
typically  following the execution of the contract  the customer begins the building or renovation of a facility to house the cyberknife or tomotherapy system  which together with the subsequent installation of the cyberknife or tomotherapy system  can take up to months to complete 
during the period prior to installation  the customer must build a radiation shielded facility to house its cyberknife or tomotherapy system 
in order to construct this facility  the customer must typically obtain radiation device installation permits  which are granted by state and local government bodies  each of which may have different criteria for permit issuance 
if a permit were denied for installation at a specific hospital or treatment center  our cyberknife or tomotherapy system could not be installed at that location 
in addition  some of our customers are cancer centers or facilities that are new  and in these cases it may be necessary for the entire facility to be completed before the cyberknife or tomotherapy system can be installed  which can result in additional construction and installation delays 
our sales and installations of cyberknife and tomotherapy systems tend to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter 
under our revenue recognition policy  we generally do not recognize revenue attributable to a cyberknife or tomotherapy system purchase until after installation has occurred  if we are responsible for providing installation  or delivery 
for international sales through distributors  we typically recognize revenue when the system is shipped and we have evidence of a purchase commitment from the end user 
under our current forms of purchase and service contracts  we record a majority of the purchase price as revenue for a cyberknife or tomotherapy system upon installation or delivery of the system 
events beyond our control may delay installation and the satisfaction of contingencies required to receive cash inflows and recognize revenue  such as procurement delay  customer funding or financing delay  delay in or unforeseen difficulties related to customers organizing legal entities and obtaining financing for cyberknife or tomotherapy system acquisition  construction delay  delay pending customer receipt of regulatory approvals  including  for example  certificates of need  delay pending customer receipt of a building or radiation device installation permit  and 
table of contents delay caused by weather or natural disaster 
in the event that a customer  for any of the reasons above or other reasons  does not proceed with installation of a system after entering into a purchase contract  we would only recognize up to the deposit portion of the purchase price as revenue  unless the deposit was refunded to the customer 
therefore  the long sales cycle together with delays in the shipment and installation of cyberknife and tomotherapy systems or customer cancellations would adversely affect our cash flows and revenue  which would harm our results of operations and may result in significant fluctuations in our reporting of quarterly revenues 
because of these fluctuations  it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the market price of our stock would likely decrease 
these fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance 
we may not be able to achieve profitability with respect to our service business relating to tomotherapy systems 
our overall service operations relating to tomotherapy systems currently are close to break even levels 
our ability to increase the profitability of this service business depends in part on reducing warranty and service costs for the tomotherapy systems and improving economies of scale in service operations 
we may be unable to achieve these reductions in costs or improve the reliability of the tomotherapy systems during the time period expected or at all  and this could adversely affect our results of operations  reduce physician confidence in our system  and erode our brand 
our ability to achieve profitability depends in part on maintaining or increasing our gross margins on product sales and service  which we may not be able to achieve 
a number of factors may result in adverse impacts to our gross margins  including actions related to new products  pricing and marketing programs  the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals  sales discounts  changes in product configurations  increases in material or labor costs  increased service or warranty costs or the failure to reduce service or warranty costs  especially with respect to the tomotherapy systems  excess inventory and inventory holding charges  obsolescence charges  our ability to reduce production costs  increased price competition  variation in the margins across products installed in a particular period  and how well we execute on our strategic and operating plans 
our long term success  results of operations and the value of our common stock depend on our ability to successfully combine the tomotherapy business with our pre existing business  which may be more difficult  costly or time consuming than expected 
on june   we acquired tomotherapy  the business of which we are continuing to integrate with our pre existing business 
while we have made significant progress in integrating the tomotherapy 
table of contents business into our pre existing business  we anticipate our integration efforts will continue for the foreseeable future 
our future success  results of operations and the value of our common stock depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating the tomotherapy business with our pre existing business 
to realize these anticipated benefits  we must successfully combine our businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
if we are not able to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame  or at all  the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be realized fully  or at all  or may take longer to realize than expected  and our results of operations and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the integration process could result in the disruption of existing business  loss of key employees  or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers  employees  suppliers and other business partners following the acquisition or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
specifically  issues that must be addressed in integrating the operations of tomotherapy into our pre existing operations in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition include  among other things integrating and optimizing the utilization of the properties  equipment  suppliers  distribution channels  manufacturing  service  marketing  promotion and sales activities and information technologies of the combined company  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures of the combined company  including the consolidation of our european offices into one new location  which we anticipate to occur in the fall of  coordinating geographically dispersed organizations of the combined company  retaining existing customers of  and attracting new customers to  the combined company  and conforming standards  controls  procedures and policies  business cultures and compensation structures throughout the combined company 
for example  system orders in the united states this fiscal year have not been as strong as in the prior year 
we believe the integration of the two sales teams in the united states has contributed to lower than anticipated system orders in this region 
we have recently implemented a realignment of the sales organization in the united states designed to improve performance in this region  and we expect to see the effects of the realignment in the coming quarters 
integration efforts require a significant increase in workload across the organization  and have diverted and will continue to divert management attention and resources 
an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  as well as any delays encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations  which may affect adversely the value of our common stock 
in addition  the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses  and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized 
actual synergies  if achieved at all  may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated 
if we are not able to adequately address these challenges  we may be unable to successfully integrate the combined company s operations or to realize the anticipated benefits of the integration 
if we are unable to develop new products or enhance existing products  we may be unable to attract or retain customers 
our success depends on the successful development  regulatory clearance or approval  introduction and commercialization of new generations of products  treatment systems  and enhancements to and or simplification of existing products 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  which are currently our principal products  are technologically complex and must keep pace with  among other things  the 
table of contents products of our competitors 
we are making significant investments in long term growth initiatives 
such initiatives require significant capital commitments  involvement of senior management and other investments on our part  which we may be unable to recover 
our timeline for the development of new products or enhancements may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
commercialization of new products may prove challenging  and we may be required to invest more time and money than expected to successfully introduce them 
once introduced  new products may adversely impact orders and sales of our existing products  or make them less desirable or even obsolete 
compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of new products or enhancements 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products  treatment systems and product enhancements and simplifications  and the revenues and costs associated with these efforts  are affected by our ability to properly identify customer needs  prove feasibility of new products  educate physicians about the use of new products and procedures  limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production  comply with internal quality assurance systems and processes timely and efficiently  limit the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances  accurately predict and control costs associated with inventory overruns caused by phase in of new products and phase out of old products  price our products competitively  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and accurately predict and control costs associated with manufacturing  installation  warranty and maintenance of the products  manage customer acceptance and payment for products  manage customer demands for retrofits of both old and new products  and anticipate and compete successfully with competitors 
even if customers accept new products or product enhancements  the revenues from these products may not be sufficient to offset the significant costs associated with making them available to customers 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance for  manufacture or introduce new products  treatment systems or enhancements  the roll out of which involves compliance with complex quality assurance processes  including the quality system regulation  or qsr  enforced by the fda 
failure to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for our products or to complete these processes in a timely and efficient manner could result in delays that could affect our ability to attract and retain customers  or could cause customers to delay or cancel orders  causing our backlog  revenues and operating results to suffer 
we depend on third party distributors to market and distribute our products in international markets 
if our distributors fail to successfully market and distribute our products  our business will be materially harmed 
we depend on a limited number of distributors in our international markets 
we have maintained both the distributors we had prior to the acquisition of tomotherapy as well as tomotherapy s distributors  as product specific distributors of our systems 
we are in the process of consolidating 
table of contents distribution channels in the jurisdictions in which we have multiple distributors 
we cannot control the efforts and resources our third party distributors will devote to marketing the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems 
our distributors may not be able to successfully market and sell the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts and may not market the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems at prices that will permit the product to develop  achieve or sustain market acceptance 
in some jurisdictions  we rely on our distributors to manage the regulatory process  and we are dependent on their ability to do so effectively 
for example  our regulatory approval in japan was suspended for a period of twelve months during as a result of a failure of our former cyberknife system distributor to coordinate product modifications and obtain necessary regulatory clearances in a timely manner 
as a result  the cyberknife system was recalled in japan and our former japanese distributor was told to stop selling the cyberknife system 
in response  we retained a regulatory consultant who was not affiliated with our former japanese distributor and worked with the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare and applied for  and received  approval to sell an updated version of the cyberknife system under the name of cyberknife ii in japan 
by working with a new distributor  chiyoda technol corporation  we were able to begin distributing the cyberknife ii system in with no probationary period 
in addition  if a distributor is terminated by us or goes out of business  it may take us a period of time to locate an alternative distributor  to seek appropriate regulatory approvals and to train its personnel to market the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  and our ability to sell and service the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems in the region formerly serviced by such terminated distributor could be materially adversely affected 
any of these factors could materially adversely affect our revenue from international markets  increase our costs in those markets or damage our reputation 
if we are unable to attract additional international distributors  our international revenue may not grow 
if our distributors experience difficulties  do not actively market the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems or do not otherwise perform under our distribution agreements  our potential for revenue and gross margins from international markets may be dramatically reduced  and our business could be harmed 
finally  our efforts to consolidate distributors may not prove to be successful and may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks related to the current global economic environment  which could delay or prevent our customers from obtaining financing to purchase the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and implement the required facilities  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the state of the global economy continues to be uncertain 
the current global economic conditions and uncertain credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit pose a risk that could impact consumer and customer demand for our products  as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers  suppliers and creditors  including financial institutions 
if the current situation continues to deteriorate or does not improve  our business could be negatively affected  including such areas as reduced demand for our products resulting from a slow down in the general economy  supplier or customer disruptions and or temporary interruptions in our ability to conduct day to day transactions through our financial intermediaries involving the payment to or collection of funds from our customers  vendors and suppliers 
for example  in the united states  some of our customers have been delayed in obtaining  or have not been able to obtain  necessary financing for their purchases of the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems 
in addition  some of our customers have been delayed in obtaining  or have not been able to obtain  necessary financing for the construction or renovation of facilities to house cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  the cost of which typically range from approximately million for a tomotherapy system and million for a cyberknife system  for customers who make only minor renovations to existing facilities  to up to million for a tomotherapy system and million for a cyberknife system  for customers who build entirely new facilities that include additional features not necessarily required for the operation of a tomotherapy or cyberknife system eg  audio visual 
table of contents equipment 
this range is based solely on information provided to us by customers and will vary by geography and the needs of a particular customer 
to date  these delays have primarily affected customers that were planning to operate freestanding cyberknife or tomotherapy systems centers  rather than hospital based customers 
these delays have in some instances led to our customers postponing the shipment and installation of previously ordered systems or cancelling their system orders  and may cause other customers to postpone their system installation or to cancel their agreements with us 
an increase in delays and order cancellations of this nature would adversely affect our product sales  backlog and revenues  and therefore harm our business and results of operations 
the high unit price of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  as well as other factors  may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our operating results  which could adversely affect our stock price 
because of the high unit price of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and the relatively small number of units installed each quarter  each installation of a cyberknife or tomotherapy system can represent a significant percentage of our revenue for a particular quarter 
therefore  if we do not install a cyberknife or tomotherapy system when anticipated  our operating results will vary significantly from our expectations 
this is of particular concern in the current volatile economic environment  where we have had experiences with customers cancelling or postponing orders for our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and delaying any required build outs 
these fluctuations and other potential fluctuations mean that you should not rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance 
in particular  in addition to the other risk factors described above and below  factors which may contribute to these fluctuations include timing of when we are able to recognize revenue associated with sales of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  which varies depending upon the terms of the applicable sales and service contracts  the proportion of revenue attributable to purchases of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems which are associated with our shared ownership program and our legacy service plans  timing and level of expenditures associated with new product development activities  regulatory requirements in some states for a certificate of need prior to the installation of a radiation device  delays in shipment due  for example  to unanticipated construction delays at customer locations where our products are to be installed  cancellations by customers  natural disasters or labor disturbances  delays in our manufacturing processes or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  timing of the announcement  introduction and delivery of new products or product upgrades by us and by our competitors  timing and level of expenditures associated with expansion of sales and marketing activities such as trade shows and our overall operations  fluctuations in our gross margins and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations  as described in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  how well we execute on our strategic and operating plans  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  actions relating to regulatory matters  demand for our products  
table of contents our ability to develop  introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  our ability to protect our proprietary rights and defend against third party challenges  disruptions in the supply or changes in the costs of raw materials  labor  product components or transportation services  and changes in third party coverage and reimbursement  changes in government regulation  or a change in a customer s financial condition or ability to obtain financing 
these factors are difficult to forecast and may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and substantial variation from our projections  particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low 
these fluctuations may cause volatility in our stock price 
if third party payors do not provide sufficient coverage and reimbursement to healthcare providers for use of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  demand for our products and our revenue could be adversely affected 
our customers rely significantly on reimbursement for cyberknife and tomotherapy procedures 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in significant part on the extent to which public and private third party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures that are performed with our products 
third party payors  and in particular managed care organizations  challenge the prices charged for medical products and services and institute cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of medical products and services 
if reimbursement policies or other cost containment measures are instituted in a manner that significantly reduces the coverage for or payment for our procedures that are performed with our products  our existing customers may not continue using our products or may decrease their use of our products  and we may have difficulty obtaining new customers 
such actions would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
in november  the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  issued the medicare payment rates 
while certain of the reimbursement rates are modestly higher than in the prior year  others are modestly lower than in the prior year  which could have a negative impact on the continued use of our products by existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
on july   medicare published its proposed rules for hospital outpatient services  for physicians  and services performed in the freestanding center setting for calendar year we expect medicare to compile its review and publish the final rules sometime in november the proposed rates for are roughly the same as the rates in the hospital outpatient setting 
cms reviews such rates annually  and could implement more significant changes in future years 
in addition  local medicare carriers have set the proposed payment in the freestanding center setting for robotic radiosurgery delivery 
for delivery of imrt in the freestanding clinic  medicare has released its proposed conversion factor  resource and malpractice values and geographic adjustment indices that would be used to calculate payment in in addition to making an adjustment to the conversion factor the multiplier used to calculate rates for all services priced under the physician fee schedule  cms has proposed targeted cuts to imrt based on its belief that shorter treatment times are typically seen in practice  as opposed to the longer times which had previously been used to calculate imrt payment 
if the cms time based proposal is retained in the final rule  the result will be a dramatic reduction in the reimbursement rate for imrt 
the rate calculation  using both the proposed conversion factor and time based reduction  would result in a decrease in the payment rate from rates  if congress does not intervene to prevent major cuts in medicare as it has done for the past nine years 
based on historical actions  we expect that the conversion factor will remain closer to the conversion factor used to calculate rates  however  if the time based reductions 
table of contents remain in place  we expect the reduction to result in approximately a decrease as compared to rates 
if in the future cms significantly decreases reimbursement rates for stereotactic radiosurgery  robotic imrt or radiation therapy services  or if other cost containment measures are implemented in the united states or elsewhere  such changes could discourage cancer treatment centers and hospitals from purchasing our products 
we have seen our customers decision making process complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the proposed reduction in medicare reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery at freestanding clinics in the united states and for physician reimbursement for radiation oncology  which has resulted in delay and sometimes even failure to purchase our products 
our industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change  which may result in products or new tumor treatments that are superior to the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
if we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands  our products may become obsolete or less useful and our operating results will suffer 
the medical device industry in general and the non invasive cancer treatment field in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies 
because our products often have long development and government approval cycles  we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands 
to compete successfully  we will need to continue to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well established alternative procedures  products and technologies  and convince physicians and other healthcare decision makers of the advantages of our products and technologies 
traditional surgery and other forms of minimally invasive procedures  brachytherapy  chemotherapy or other drugs remain alternatives to the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
we consider the competition for the tomotherapy systems to be existing radiation therapy systems  primarily using c arm linacs  which are sold by large  well capitalized companies with significantly greater market share and resources than we have 
several of these competitors are also able to leverage their fixed sales  service and other costs over multiple products or product lines 
in particular  we compete with a number of existing radiation therapy equipment companies including varian medical systems  inc  elekta ab  mitsubishi heavy industries  and to a lesser extent  brainlab ag 
varian medical systems has been the leader in the external beam radiation therapy market for many years and has the majority market share for radiation therapy systems worldwide 
in  varian began selling and installing rapidarc technology 
the rapidarc technology purports to be able to deliver image guided  intensity modulated radiation therapy more rapidly than other similar systems  including the tomotherapy systems  and varian has maintained a strong marketing campaign claiming this technology has the same capabilities as  or better capabilities than  our tomotherapy systems 
in april   varian announced the launch of a new line of truebeam systems  which varian claims are specifically designed for high precision image guided radiotherapy and radiosurgery 
varian claims this new platform is designed to be versatile and can be used for all forms of advanced external beam radiation therapy 
in april  varian and siemens announced that they had entered into a strategic global partnership involving mutual marketing and representation of products for imaging and treatment in the global radiation oncology business  the development of software interfaces between siemens and varian treatment systems and potential joint development of new products 
the cyberknife system also competes directly with conventional linac based radiation therapy systems primarily from elekta ab  brainlab ag  mitsubishi heavy industries and varian medical systems 
at least one other company has announced that it is developing a product that  if introduced  would be directly competitive with the cyberknife system 
in general  because of aging demographics and attractive market factors in oncology  we believe that new competitors will enter the radiosurgery and radiation therapy markets in the years ahead 
the cyberknife system has not typically been used to perform traditional radiation therapy and therefore competition has been limited with conventional 
table of contents medical linacs that perform traditional radiation therapy 
however  the cyberknife vsi system  which we introduced in november of  may be used to perform robotic imrt  an advanced method of traditional radiation therapy  which products of elekta  siemens and varian are also capable of performing 
in addition  some manufacturers of conventional linac based radiation therapy systems  including varian and elekta  have products that can be used in combination with body and or head frames and image guidance systems to perform both radiosurgical and radiotherapy procedures 
furthermore  many government  academic and business entities are investing substantial resources in research and development of cancer treatments  including surgical approaches  radiation treatment  mri guided radiotherapy systems  proton therapy systems  drug treatment  gene therapy which is the treatment of disease by replacing  manipulating  or supplementing nonfunctional genes  and other approaches 
successful developments that result in new approaches for the treatment of cancer could reduce the attractiveness of our products or render them obsolete 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies 
rapid technological development may render the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and their technologies obsolete 
many of our competitors have or may have greater corporate  financial  operational  sales and marketing resources  and more experience and resources in research and development than we have 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete or less useful 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise  marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies 
our competitive position also depends on widespread awareness  acceptance and adoption by the radiation oncology and cancer therapy markets of our products  the development of new technologies that improve the effectiveness and productivity of the cyberknife system radiosurgery process and the tomotherapy system radiation therapy process  product and procedure coverage and reimbursement from third party payors  insurance companies and others  availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors  insurance companies and others for procedures performed using our systems  properly identifying customer needs and delivering new products or product enhancements to address those needs  published  peer reviewed studies supporting the efficacy and safety and long term clinical benefit of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  limiting the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production  limiting the timing and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances  the manufacture and delivery of our products in sufficient volumes on time  and accurately predicting and controlling costs associated with manufacturing  installation  warranty and maintenance of the products  our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  the extent of our intellectual property protection or our ability to otherwise develop proprietary products and processes  
table of contents the ability of our competitors to obtain government funding for the development of intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions  securing sufficient capital resources to expand both our continued research and development  and sales and marketing efforts  and obtaining and maintaining any necessary united states or foreign market approvals or clearances 
if customers choose not to purchase a cyberknife or tomotherapy system or choose to purchase our competitors products  our revenue and market share would be adversely impacted  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  companies in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology fields may seek to develop methods of cancer treatment that are more effective than radiation therapy and radiosurgery  resulting in decreased demand for the tomotherapy or cyberknife systems 
because the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems have a long development cycle and because it can take significant time to receive government approvals or clearances for changes to the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation 
accordingly  if we are unable to anticipate and keep pace with new innovations in the cancer treatment market  the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems or an aspect of their functionality may be rendered obsolete  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  some of our competitors may compete by changing their pricing model or by lowering the price of their conventional radiation therapy systems or ancillary supplies  or by combining with other competitors 
if such pricing strategies are implemented  there could be downward pressure on the price of radiation therapy and radiosurgery systems 
if we are unable to maintain or increase our selling prices  our gross margins will decline  and there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key employees  the loss of whom would adversely affect our business 
if we fail to attract and retain employees with the expertise required for our business  we may be unable to continue to grow our business 
we are highly dependent on the members of our senior management  operations and research and development staff 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to retain these key employees and to identify  hire and retain additional personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the medical device industry  particularly in northern california and in madison  wisconsin  is intense  and finding and retaining qualified personnel with experience in our industry is very difficult 
we believe there are only a limited number of individuals with the requisite skills to serve in many of our key positions and we compete for key personnel with other medical equipment and software manufacturers and technology companies  as well as universities and research institutions 
it is increasingly difficult  time consuming and expensive to hire and retain these persons  and we may be unable to replace key persons if they leave or fill new positions requiring key persons with appropriate experience 
a significant portion of our compensation to our key employees is in the form of stock option grants 
a prolonged depression in our stock price could make it difficult for us to retain our employees and recruit additional qualified personnel 
we do not maintain  and do not currently intend to obtain  key employee life insurance on any of our personnel 
if we fail to hire and retain personnel in key positions  we may be unable to continue to grow our business successfully 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our business may be significantly harmed 
in order to implement our business strategy  we expect continued growth in our infrastructure requirements  particularly as we expand our manufacturing and research and development capacities 
to manage our growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our management  operational and 
table of contents financial systems  hire and train additional qualified personnel  scale up our manufacturing capacity and expand our marketing and distribution capabilities 
our manufacturing  assembly and installation process is complex and occurs over many months  and we must effectively scale this entire process to satisfy customer expectations and changes in demand 
further  to accommodate our growth and compete effectively  we will be required to improve our information systems 
we cannot be certain that our personnel  systems  procedures and internal controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
disruption of critical information systems could harm our business and financial condition 
information technology helps us operate efficiently  interface with customers  maintain financial accuracy and efficiency  and accurately produce our financial statements 
we implemented and began use of a new enterprise resource planning  or erp system effective january  our initial implementation covered the basic elements of our erp system 
we recently migrated processes and systems used by tomotherapy to the processes and systems used with our new erp system  and we plan to implement additional capabilities in the future 
if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure  or if we fail to smoothly manage the new erp system or its recent integration with tomotherapy s processes and systems  we could be subject to transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  the loss of customers  business disruptions  or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through a security breach 
in addition  we are considering moving some of our data and information to the cloud  where applications and data are hosted  accessed and processed through a third party provider over a broadband internet connection 
in a cloud computing environment  we could be subject to outages and security breaches by the third party service provider 
if our data management systems do not effectively collect  store  process and report relevant data for the operation of our business  whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints  software deficiencies  computer viruses  security breaches  catastrophic events or human error  our ability to effectively plan  forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired  perhaps materially 
any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the timeliness with which we internally and externally report our operating results 
likewise  data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized person or to the public 
for example  in may of  an email containing confidential employee information was inadvertently sent to all company employees in our madison  wisconsin campus 
immediately upon discovery of this error  accuray s information technology department took all possible steps to recover this email and to prevent its further distribution 
in addition  the company offered to pay for up to two years of credit monitoring for any employee desiring such service 
there can be no assurance that any efforts we make to prevent against such privacy breaches will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to protect from fraudulent  illegal or unauthorized transactions 
if we cannot maintain effective controls and provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed 
our management determined  as of june   that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to our accounting for significant and non routine transactions 
during fiscal  our remediation efforts with respect to this material weakness included hiring several finance personnel  which has provided us with the appropriate resources and technical skills to ensure 
table of contents that the period end financial close and reporting processes are completed in an adequate and reliable manner and implementing a practice pursuant to which we have consulted with  and will continue to consult with  external subject matter experts as necessary  prior to execution of any significant  non routine transactions in order to validate the accounting approach to be taken with respect to such transactions 
as a result of the implementation of these remediation measures  management determined that the material weakness described above was successfully remediated and no longer existed as of june  a failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements or otherwise cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 
this  in turn  could result in a loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and our stock price  and we could be subject to stockholder litigation 
we may have difficulties in determining the effectiveness of our internal controls due to our complex financial model 
the complexity of our financial model contributes to our need for effective financial reporting systems and internal controls 
we recognize revenue from a range of transactions including cyberknife and tomotherapy system sales  our shared ownership program and services 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are complex products that contain both hardware and software elements 
the complexity of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems and of our financial model pertaining to revenue recognition requires us to process a broader range of financial transactions than would be required by a company with a less complex financial model 
accordingly  deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls would likely impact us more significantly than they would impact a company with a less complex financial model 
if we were to find that our internal controls were deficient  we could be required to amend or restate historical or pro forma financial statements  which would likely have a negative impact on our stock price 
if we are unable to maintain existing research collaboration relationships  enter into new collaboration arrangements in the future or enter into license agreements with our collaborators and others  our ability to enhance our products may be adversely affected 
we have entered into a number of research collaboration arrangements with a range of hospitals  cancer treatment centers and academic institutions 
these collaborations support our internal research and development capabilities and represent a key element of our ongoing research and development program 
our research collaboration partners may not fulfill all of their obligations under our arrangements with them 
if our current research collaborations do not meet our research and development expectations  or if we are unable to enter into additional research collaborations in the future to replace unproductive collaborations or add new collaborations  our ability to enhance our products may be adversely affected 
our inability to successfully collaborate with third parties could increase our development costs  delay new or pending developments and limit the likelihood of successful enhancements to the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems 
our collaboration agreements generally provide that we either own  in the case of our own developments  have the right to use  in the case of joint developments  or have the right to license  in the case of developments by our collaborator  technology developed pursuant to a collaboration 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will successfully enter into license agreements with any of our collaborators concerning technology that is jointly developed or developed by the collaborator  which may prevent us from using that technology 
if we are unable to enter into exclusive license agreements with a collaborator over technology that is jointly developed with  or solely developed by  the collaborator  the collaborator may be able to use or license the technology to third parties 
furthermore  if we are unable to enter into license agreements with a collaborator for technology that 
table of contents is jointly developed with  or solely developed by  the collaborator  we may be unable to use that technology 
in addition  if we are unable to agree with our collaborators concerning ownership or proper inventorship of technology developed under the collaboration agreement  we may be forced to engage in arbitration or litigation to determine the proper ownership or inventorship 
any of these events could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
third parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our product 
the medical device industry is characterized by a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  the field of radiation treatment of cancer is well established and crowded with the intellectual property of competitors and others 
we also expect that other participants will enter the field 
a number of companies in our market  as well as universities and research institutions  have issued patents and have filed patent applications which relate to the use of radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery to treat cancerous and benign tumors 
determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  and the outcome of patent litigation actions is often uncertain 
we have not conducted an extensive search of patents issued to third parties  and no assurance can be given that third party patents containing claims covering our products  parts of our products  technology or methods do not exist  have not been filed  or could not be filed or issued 
because of the number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields  our competitors or other third parties may assert that our products and the methods we employ in the use of our products are covered by united states or foreign patents held by them 
for example  on august   best medical international  inc  or best medical  filed a lawsuit against accuray in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania  claiming accuray has infringed us patent no 
 a patent that best medical alleges protects a method and apparatus for conformal radiation therapy  and on december   best medical filed an amended complaint  claiming that the company also infringes us patent nos 
 and  both of which best medical alleges cover methods and apparatus for conformal radiation therapy 
on march   the court dismissed with prejudice all counts against the company  except for two counts of alleged willful infringement of two of the patents 
the court issued a scheduling order on may  appointing a special master for claim construction  and setting a claim construction hearing on january  best medical moved to voluntarily dismiss one of the two remaining patents on june   which the court granted on june   leaving only one patent at issue in the case 
the court held a claim construction hearing on may   and we await a ruling by the court 
best medical is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief as well as unspecified compensatory and treble damages and other relief 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction  there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware  and which may result in issued patents which our current or future products infringe 
also  because the claims of published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant  there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with claims that we infringe 
there could also be existing patents that one or more of our products or parts may infringe and of which we are unaware 
as the number of competitors in the market for less invasive cancer treatment alternatives grows  and as the number of patents issued in this area grows  the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases 
regardless of the merit of infringement claims  they can be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
in addition  any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations 

table of contents in the event that we become subject to a patent infringement or other intellectual property lawsuit and if the relevant patents or other intellectual property were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe or violate the terms of a license to which we are a party  we could be prevented from selling our products unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign the product to avoid infringement 
required licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we were unable to obtain a license or successfully redesign our system  we might be prevented from selling our system 
if there is an allegation or determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a competitor or other person  we may be required to pay damages  or a settlement or ongoing royalties 
in these circumstances  we may be unable to sell our products at competitive prices or at all  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 
as is common in the medical device industry  we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical equipment or biotechnology companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend or against these claims 
for example  on september   best medical filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania  claiming we induced certain individuals to leave the employment of best medical and join our company in order to gain access to best medical s confidential information and trade secrets 
best medical is seeking monetary damages and other relief 
we filed a motion for summary judgment on may   best medical filed its response on june   and we filed a response to their response on july  on october   the court granted summary judgment in our favor on all counts 
on november  best medical filed a notice of appeal  and the parties await a ruling by the appellate court 
best medical is seeking monetary damages and other relief 
even if we are successful in defending against claims of this nature  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
if we are not able to meet the requirements of our license agreement with the wisconsin alumni research foundation warf we could lose access to the technologies licensed thereunder and be unable to manufacture  market or sell the tomotherapy systems 
we license patents from warf covering the multi leaf collimator and other key technologies incorporated into the tomotherapy systems under a license agreement that requires us to pay royalties to warf 
in addition  the license agreement obligates us to pursue an agreed development plan and to submit periodic reports  and restricts our ability to take actions to defend the licensed patents 
warf has the right to unilaterally terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain minimum royalty obligations or satisfy other obligations related to our utilization of the technology 
if warf were to terminate the agreement or if we were to otherwise lose the ability to exploit the licensed patents  our competitive advantage would be reduced and we may not be able to find a source to replace the licensed technology 
the license agreement reserves to warf the initial right to defend or prosecute any claim arising with respect to the licensed technology 
if warf does not vigorously defend the patents  we may be required to engage in expensive patent litigation to enforce our rights  and any competitive advantage we have based on the licensed technology may be hampered 
any of these events could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents it is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies  and we may not be able to ensure their protection 
our success depends significantly on our ability to obtain  maintain and protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products 
patents and other proprietary rights provide uncertain protections  and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property 
for example  we may be unsuccessful in defending our patents and other proprietary rights against third party challenges 
as key patents expire  our ability to prevent competitors from copying our technology may be limited 
in addition to patents  we rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if these measures do not protect our rights adequately  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
although we have attempted to obtain patent coverage for our technology where available and appropriate  there are aspects of the technology for which patent coverage was never sought or never received 
there are also countries in which we sell or intend to sell the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems but have no patents or pending patent applications 
our ability to prevent others from making or selling duplicate or similar technologies will be impaired in those countries in which we have no patent protection 
although we have several issued patents in the united states and in foreign countries protecting aspects of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  our pending united states and foreign patent applications may not issue  may issue only with limited coverage or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and held invalid or unenforceable 
similarly  our issued patents and those of our licensors may not provide us with any competitive advantages 
competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes comparable or superior to ours 
our patents may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties  and others may challenge the inventorship or ownership of our patents and pending patent applications 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention from our core business 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate  and the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  may not be commercially valuable 
litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
additionally  we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us 
we also license patent and other proprietary rights to aspects of our technology to third parties in fields where we currently do not operate as well as in fields where we currently do operate 
disputes with our licensees may arise regarding the scope and content of these licenses 
further  our ability to expand into additional fields with our technologies may be restricted by our existing licenses or licenses we may grant to third parties in the future 
the policies we have in place to protect our trade secrets may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our trade secrets by others 
in addition  confidentiality agreements executed by our employees  consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
litigating a trade secret claim is expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
in addition  courts outside the united states are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets 
moreover  our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge methods and know how 
if we are 
table of contents unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to prevent competitors from using our own inventions and intellectual property to compete against us  and our business may be harmed 
we could become subject to product liability claims  product recalls  other field actions and warranty claims that could be expensive  divert management s attention and harm our business 
our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the manufacturing  marketing and sale of medical device products 
we may be held liable if a cyberknife or tomotherapy system causes injury or death or is found otherwise unsuitable during usage 
our products incorporate sophisticated components and computer software 
complex software can contain errors  particularly when first introduced 
in addition  new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that  despite testing  are discovered only after installation 
because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical and therapeutic procedures involving delivery of radiation to the body  defects  even if small  could result in a number of complications  some of which could be serious and could harm or kill patients 
any weaknesses in training and services associated with our products may also result in product liability lawsuits 
it is also possible that defects in the design  manufacture or labeling of our products might necessitate a product recall or other field corrective action  which may result in warranty claims beyond our expectations and may harm our reputation and create adverse publicity 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
we may also be subject to claims for property damage or economic loss related to  or resulting from  any errors or defects in our products  or the installation  servicing and support of our products  or any professional services rendered in conjunction with our products 
the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover future claims 
if sales of our products increase or we suffer future product liability claims  we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or with adequate amounts of coverage 
a product liability claim  any product recalls or other field actions or excessive warranty claims  whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or labeling  could negatively affect our sales or require a change in the design  manufacturing process or the indications for which the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems may be used  any of which could harm our reputation and business and result in a decline in revenue 
in addition  if a product we designed or manufactured is defective  whether due to design or manufacturing  or labeling defects  improper use of the product or other reasons  we may be required to notify regulatory authorities and or to recall the product  possibly at our expense 
we have voluntarily conducted recalls and product corrections in the past  including four recalls for the cyberknife systems and two recalls for the tomotherapy systems during fiscal year each of these recalls was initiated by accuray 
no serious adverse health consequences have been reported in connection with these recalls  and the costs associated with each such recall were not material 
a required notification of a correction or removal to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of our products  which could in turn result in required recalls  restrictions on the sale of the products or other civil or criminal penalties 
the adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could cause customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us 
these investigations  corrections or recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity  patient injury or termination of customer contracts  could result in our incurring substantial costs  losing revenues and damaging our reputation  each of which would harm our business 
the safety and efficacy of our products for certain uses is not yet supported by long term clinical data  and our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought 
although we believe that the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems have advantages over competing products and technologies  we do not have sufficient clinical data demonstrating these advantages for all tumor indications 
for example  because our cyberknife procedures are relatively 
table of contents new  we have limited clinical data relating to the effectiveness of the cyberknife system as a means of controlling the growth of cancer at a particular body site 
in addition  we have only limited five year patient survival rate data  which is a common long term measure of clinical effectiveness in cancer treatment 
further  future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with the cyberknife system does not improve patient survival or outcomes 
likewise  because the tomotherapy system has only been on the market since  we have limited complication or patient survival rate data with respect to treatment using the system 
in addition  while the effectiveness of radiation therapy is well understood  there is a growing but still limited number of peer reviewed medical journal publications regarding the efficacy of highly conformal treatment such as that delivered by the tomotherapy system 
if future patient studies or clinical experience do not support our beliefs that the tomotherapy system offers a more advantageous treatment for a wide variety of cancer types  use of the system could fail to increase or could decrease  and our business would therefore be adversely affected 
such results could reduce the rate of reimbursement by both public and private third party payors for procedures that are performed with our products  slow the adoption of our products by physicians  significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
in addition  if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  the fda could rescind our clearances  our reputation with physicians  patients and others may suffer and we could be subject to significant legal liability 
the cyberknife systems have been in use for a limited period of time for uses outside the brain  and the medical community has not yet developed a large quantity of peer reviewed literature that supports safe and effective use in those locations in the body 
the cyberknife system was initially cleared by a number of regulatory authorities for the treatment of tumors in the brain and neck 
more recently  the cyberknife systems have been cleared in the united states to treat tumors anywhere in the body where radiation is indicated  and our future growth is dependent in large part on continued growth in full body use of the system 
currently  however  there are a limited number of peer reviewed medical journal publications regarding the safety and efficacy of the cyberknife system for treatment of tumors outside the brain or spine 
if later studies show that the cyberknife systems are less effective or less safe with respect to particular types of solid tumors  or in the event clinical studies do not achieve the results anticipated at the outset of the study  use of the cyberknife system could fail to increase or could decrease and our growth and operating results would therefore be harmed 
any failure in our physician training efforts could result in potential liabilities 
we rely on physicians to devote adequate time to learn to use our products 
if physicians are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury and related liability or negative publicity which could have an adverse effect on our product sales 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters  epidemics  terrorist acts and other events beyond our control  which would adversely affect our business 
we have facilities in countries around the world  including three manufacturing facilities  each of which is equipped to manufacture unique components of our products 
the manufacturing facilities are located in sunnyvale  california  madison  wisconsin and chengdu  china 
we do not maintain backup manufacturing facilities for all of our manufacturing facilities or for our it facilities  so we depend on each of our current facilities for the continued operation of our business 
in addition  we conduct a 
table of contents significant portion of other activities  including administration and data processing  at facilities located in the state of california which has experienced major earthquakes in the past  as well as other natural disasters 
chengdu  china  where one of our manufacturing facilities is located  has also experienced major earthquakes in the past 
we do not carry earthquake insurance 
unexpected events at any of our facilities  including fires or explosions  natural disasters  such as hurricanes  floods  tornados and earthquakes  war or terrorist activities  unplanned outages  supply disruptions  and failures of equipment or systems  or the failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events  could significantly disrupt our operations  delay or prevent product manufacture and shipment for the time required to repair  rebuild or replace our manufacturing facilities  which could be lengthy  result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities  and adversely affect our results of operation 
in addition  the march earthquake and tsunami in japan  and other collateral events  including  among others  the catastrophic loss of lives  businesses  infrastructure  and delays in transportation  may have a direct negative impact on us or an indirect impact on us by affecting our employees  customers  or the overall economy in japan  and as a result  we may experience a reduction in demand for our products and services 
in addition  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  delays in sales to potential customers in japan 
we may also experience delays in installation schedules for  or cancellations of sales to  existing japanese customers 
if installation schedules are delayed or products are not accepted by our customers in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
as a result of these events  our revenue and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we rely on a third party to perform spare parts shipping and other logistics functions on our behalf 
a failure or disruption at our logistics provider would adversely impact our business 
customer service is a critical element of our sales strategy 
as of june   third party logistics providers stored most of our spare parts inventory in depots around the world and performed a significant portion of our spare parts logistics and shipping activities 
if any of our logistics providers suffers an interruption in its business  or experiences delays  disruptions or quality control problems in its operations  or we have to change and qualify alternative logistics providers for our spare parts  shipments of spare parts to our customers may be delayed and our reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our reliance on single source suppliers for critical components of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner 
we currently depend on single source suppliers for some of the critical components necessary for the assembly of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  including  with respect to the cyberknife system  the robot and imaging detectors  and  with respect to the tomotherapy systems  the ring gantry  the solid state modulator  the radiation detector and the magnetron 
if any single source supplier was to cease delivering components to us or fail to provide the components to our specifications and on a timely basis  we might be required to find alternative sources for these components 
in some cases  alternative suppliers may be located in the same geographic area as existing suppliers  and are thus subject to the same economic  political  and geographic factors that may affect existing suppliers to meet our demand 
we may have difficulty or be unable to find alternative sources for these components 
as a result  we may be unable to meet the demand for the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  which could harm our ability to generate revenue and damage our reputation 
even if we do find alternate suppliers  we will be required to qualify any such alternate suppliers and we would likely experience a lengthy delay in our manufacturing processes or a cessation in production  which would result in delays of shipment to end users 
we cannot assure you that our single source suppliers will be able or willing to meet our future demands 

table of contents we generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory  which makes us even more susceptible to harm if a single source supplier fails to deliver components on a timely basis 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a critical component of the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities  procedures and operations that comply with our quality and applicable regulatory requirements 
we also will be required to assess the new manufacturer s compliance with all applicable regulations and guidelines  which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner 
if the change in manufacturer results in a significant change to the product  a new k clearance would be necessary  which would likely cause substantial delays 
the disruption or termination of the supply of key components for the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems could harm our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget  harm our ability to generate revenue  lead to customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations 
if compact particle acceleration corporation cpac is not able to achieve its goals  we may need to write down or write off our investment in cpac 
since april  tomotherapy has been an investor in cpac to continue development of its research initiative for a compact proton therapy system for the treatment of cancer 
cpac has sought  and is continuing to seek  investments from third parties to support the development of this technology 
on april   we entered into various transactions with cpac and its other stockholders pursuant to which we invested million and the other stockholders invested million 
we also agreed  under certain circumstances  to invest up to an additional million in exchange for preferred stock of cpac and warrants to purchase common stock  provided cpac is able to raise an additional million from other investors  and convert certain of our convertible loans with cpac into preferred stock 
in connection with the transactions  we terminated our option to purchase a portion of the cpac stock held by other cpac investors 
we now have the option  upon the occurrence of certain events  to elect to either acquire cpac or enter into a non exclusive supply and distribution agreement for cpac s compact proton therapy products 
the triggers for the option becoming exercisable include cpac achieving certain technical milestones or the cpac board approving a proposal for the acquisition of cpac 
if accuray were to elect the option to acquire cpac  the acquisition price would be equal to the fair market value of cpac at such time  as determined by one or more appraisers 
in the future  cpac will require additional funding to continue its development efforts 
we cannot be certain that cpac will be able to obtain all of the additional financing required for this project on commercially reasonable terms or that the technology development will be successful 
even if cpac is able to obtain financing and the technology development is successful  cpac may not have the resources to commercialize the compact proton system  the market requirements may change such that commercialization is no longer feasible  or we may not be in a position to finance our option to purchase cpac or to become a supplier or distributor of its technology 
if any or all of these risks occur  we may need to write down or write off our investment in cpac  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited  and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy 
while we believe that our existing cash and short term and long term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months  the timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on numerous factors  including the other risk factors described above and below  as well as market acceptance of our products  
table of contents the need to adapt to changing technologies and technical requirements  our ability to continue to increase orders growth and revenue  manage expenses and integrate the tomotherapy business  our ability to improve service margins  the existence of opportunities for expansion  and access to and availability of sufficient management  technical  marketing and financial personnel 
if our capital resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or debt securities or obtain other debt financing  which could be difficult or impossible in the current economic and capital markets environments 
our debt levels may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure that additional financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
international sales of our products account for a significant portion of our revenue  which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations 
our international sales have increased over the last four fiscal years 
the percentage of our revenue derived from sales outside of the united states was in  in and in to accommodate our international sales  we have invested significant financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure that will meet the needs of our customers 
we anticipate that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from sales of our products in foreign markets and that the percentage of our overall revenue that is derived from these markets may continue to increase 
this revenue and related operations will therefore continue to be subject to the risks associated with international operations  including economic or political instability  shipping delays  changes in foreign regulatory laws governing  among other matters  the clearance  approval and sales of medical devices  the potential failure to comply with foreign regulatory requirements to market our products on a timely basis or at all  difficulties in enforcing agreements with and collecting receivables from customers outside the united states  longer payment cycles associated with many customers outside the united states  adequate coverage and reimbursement for the cyberknife and tomotherapy treatment procedures outside the united states  failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  the possibility that foreign countries may impose additional taxes  tariffs or other restrictions on foreign trade  failure of accuray employees or distributors to comply with export laws and requirements which may result in civil or criminal penalties and restrictions on our ability to export our products  
table of contents the expense and difficulty of establishing and managing facilities and operations in foreign markets  building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations  risks relating to foreign currency  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and contractual provisions governed by foreign laws and various trade restrictions  including us prohibitions and restrictions on exports of certain products and technologies to certain nations 
our inability to overcome these obstacles could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
even if we are successful in managing these obstacles  our partners internationally are subject to these same risks and may not be able to manage these obstacles effectively 
our international operations are also subject to laws regarding the conduct of business overseas  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  and the uk bribery act of the fcpa prohibits the provision of illegal or improper inducements to foreign government officials in connection with the obtaining of business overseas 
becoming familiar with and implementing the infrastructure necessary to ensure that we and our distributors comply with laws  rules and regulations applicable to new business activities and mitigate and protect against corruption risks could be quite costly  and there can be no assurance that any policies and procedures we do implement will protect us against liability under the fcpa or related laws for actions taken by our agents  employees and intermediaries with respect to our business 
violations of the fcpa or other similar laws by us or any of our employees  executive officers  distributors or other agents could subject us or the individuals involved to criminal or civil liability  cause a loss of reputation in the market  and materially harm our business 
in addition  future imposition of  or significant increases in  the level of customs duties  export quotas  regulatory restrictions or trade restrictions could materially harm our business 
we have limited experience and capability in manufacturing 
if we encounter manufacturing problems  or if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal  state or foreign manufacturing standards  we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations  which would result in delays and lost revenue 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are complex  and require the integration of a number of components from several sources of supply 
we must manufacture and assemble these complex systems in commercial quantities in compliance with strictly enforced regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost 
we have a limited history of manufacturing commercial quantities of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
in particular  we manufacture compact linacs as a component of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
our linac components are extremely complex devices and require significant expertise to manufacture  and as a result of our limited manufacturing experience we may have difficulty producing needed materials in a commercially viable manner 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  including problems with quality control and assurance  component supply shortages  increased costs  shortages of qualified personnel  the long lead time required to develop additional radiation shielded facilities for purposes of testing our products and or difficulties associated with compliance with local  state  federal and foreign regulatory requirements 
if our manufacturing capacity does not keep pace with product demand  we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which in turn may have a negative effect on our financial results and overall business 
conversely  if demand for our products decreases  the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may adversely affect our financial results 
our manufacturing processes and the manufacturing processes of our third party suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr 
the qsr is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production processes  controls  manufacturing  labeling  quality assurance  packaging  storage and shipping of our 
table of contents products 
furthermore  we are required to verify that our suppliers maintain facilities  procedures and operations that comply with our quality requirements 
we are also subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices  and we are required to comply with international organization for standardization  or iso  quality system standards in order to produce products for sale in europe  as well as various other foreign laws and regulations 
because our manufacturing processes include diagnostic and therapeutic x ray equipment and laser equipment  we are subject to the electronic product radiation control provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  which requires that we file reports with the fda  applicable states and our customers regarding the distribution  manufacturing and installation of these types of equipment 
the fda enforces the qsr and the electronic product radiation control provisions through periodic inspections  some of which may be unannounced 
we have been  and anticipate in the future being subject to such inspections 
fda inspections usually occur every two to three years 
during such inspections  the fda may issue inspectional observations on form fda  listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and procedures  or warning letters 
our sunnyvale facility  where we manufacture the cyberknife system  was most recently inspected by the fda in june the inspection resulted in several observations 
the initial classification of the inspection is considered to be voluntary action indicated 
we have undertaken corrective actions in response to the fda s observations 
if a manufacturer does not adequately address the observations  the fda may take enforcement action against the manufacturer  including the imposition of fines  restriction of the ability to export product  total shutdown of production facilities and criminal prosecution 
if we or a third party supplier receive a form fda with material or major observations that are not promptly corrected  fail to pass a qsr inspection  or fail to comply with these  iso and other applicable regulatory requirements  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing operations could be delayed 
our failure to take prompt and satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse inspection or our failure to comply with applicable standards could result in enforcement actions  including a public warning letter  a shutdown of our manufacturing operations  a recall of our products  civil or criminal penalties  or other sanctions  which would cause our sales and business to suffer 
in addition  because some foreign regulatory approvals are based on approvals or clearances from the fda  any failure to comply with fda requirements may also disrupt our sales of products in other countries 
we cannot assure you that the fda or other governmental authorities would agree with our interpretation of applicable regulatory requirements or that we or our third party suppliers have in all instances fully complied with all applicable requirements 
if any of these events occurs  our reputation could be harmed  we could lose customers and there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot achieve the required level and quality of production  we may need to outsource production or rely on licensing and other arrangements with third parties who possess sufficient manufacturing facilities and capabilities in compliance with regulatory requirements 
even if we could outsource needed production or enter into licensing or other third party arrangements  this could reduce our gross margin and expose us to the risks inherent in relying on others 
we also cannot assure you that our suppliers will deliver an adequate supply of required components on a timely basis or that they will adequately comply with the qsr 
failure to obtain these components on a timely basis would disrupt our manufacturing processes and increase our costs  which would harm our operating results 
we may attempt to acquire new businesses  products or technologies  or enter into strategic collaborations or alliances  and if we are unable to successfully complete these acquisitions or to integrate acquired businesses  products  technologies or employees  we may fail to realize expected benefits or harm our existing business 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies  customer demands and competitive pressures 
in some 
table of contents circumstances  we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses  products or technologies  or through collaborating with complementary businesses  rather than through internal development 
the identification of suitable acquisition or alliance candidates can be difficult  time consuming and costly  and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or alliances 
other companies may compete with us for these strategic opportunities 
furthermore  even if we successfully complete an acquisition or alliance  we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations  products or technologies into our operations  and the process of integration could be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources  and we may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition  collaboration or strategic alliance 
furthermore  the products and technologies that we acquire or with respect to which we collaborate may not be successful  or may require significantly greater resources and investments than we originally anticipated 
in addition  we may be unable to retain employees of acquired companies  or retain the acquired company s customers  suppliers  distributors or other partners who are our competitors or who have close relationships with our competitors 
consequently  we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or alliances which could harm our existing business 
in addition  future acquisitions or alliances could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or expenses  or other charges such as in process research and development  any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results or cause a reduction in the price of our common stock 
multiple factors may adversely affect our ability to fully utilize certain tax loss carryforwards 
as of june   we had approximately million and million in federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  respectively  which expire in varying amounts beginning in for federal and for state purposes 
in addition  as of june   we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal research credits will begin to expire in  the california research credits have no expiration date  and the other state research credits will begin to expire in utilization of our net operating loss and credit carry forwards is subject to annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by section of the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
however  none of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are expected to expire as a result of the ownership change limitation 
our results may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
currently  the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could require us to reduce our sales price or make our products less competitive in international markets 
also  if our international sales increase  we may enter into a greater number of transactions denominated in non us dollars  which would expose us to foreign currency risks  including changes in currency exchange rates 
if we are unable to address these risks and challenges effectively  our international operations may not be successful and our business would be materially harmed 
changes in interpretation or application of generally accepted accounting principles may adversely affect our operating results 
we prepare our financial statements to conform with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  american institute of certified public accountants  the public company accounting oversight board  the securities and exchange commission and various other regulatory or accounting bodies 
a change in interpretations of  or our application of  these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before a change is announced 
additionally  as we are required to adopt new accounting standards  our methods of accounting for 
table of contents certain items may change  which could cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
for example  due to the significance of the software component in certain of our products  we are currently bound by the software revenue recognition rules for a portion of our business 
we adopted asu and asu in the first quarter of fiscal and the impact of the adoption of asu and asu on our consolidated financial statements has been assessed at note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the application of different types of accounting principles and related potential changes may make it more difficult to compare our financial results from quarter to quarter  and the trading price of our common stock could suffer or become more volatile as a result 
as a strategy to assist our sales efforts  we may offer extended payment terms  which may potentially result in higher days sales outstanding and greater payment defaults 
we offer longer or extended payment terms for qualified customers in some circumstances 
as of june   customer contracts with extended payment terms of more than one year amounted to less than of our accounts receivable balance 
while we qualify customers to whom we offer longer or extended payment terms  their financial positions may change adversely over the longer time period given for payment 
this may result in an increase in payment defaults  which would affect our revenue 
our liquidity could be adversely impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
the available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions  consisting of money market funds and certificates of deposit 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time  we also have funds in our operating accounts that are with third party financial institutions that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic  insurance limits 
while we monitor daily the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or become subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
risks related to the regulation of our products and business modifications  upgrades and future products related to the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems or new indications may require new fda k clearances or premarket approvals  and such modifications  or any defects in design  manufacture or labeling may require us to recall or cease marketing the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems until approvals or clearances are obtained 
the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by local  state and the federal government  including by the fda 
the fda regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device s design  development  testing manufacturing  labeling  storage  record keeping  adverse event reporting  sale  promotion  distribution and shipping 
before a new medical device  or a new intended use or indication of or claim for an existing product  can be marketed in the united states  it must first receive either premarket approval or k clearance from the fda  unless an exemption exists 
either process can be expensive and lengthy 
the fda s k clearance process generally takes from three to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly and uncertain than the k clearance process and it generally takes from one to three years  or even longer  from the time the application is 
table of contents filed with the fda 
despite the time  effort and cost  there can be no assurance that a particular device or a modification of a device will be approved or cleared by the fda through either the premarket approval process or k clearance process 
even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals  they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses of the product  which may limit the market for those products  and how those products can be promoted 
medical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared 
the fda also may change its policies  adopt additional regulations  or revise existing regulations  each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or k clearance of our device  or could impact our ability to market our currently cleared device 
we are also subject to medical device reporting regulations which require us to report to the fda if our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury  or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury 
we also are subject to quality system regulations 
our products are also subject to state regulations and various worldwide laws and regulations 
a component of our strategy is to continue to upgrade the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
upgrades previously released by us required k clearance before we were able to offer them for sale 
we expect our future upgrades will similarly require k clearance  however  future upgrades may be subject to the substantially more time consuming data generation requirements and uncertain premarket approval or clearance process 
if we were required to use the premarket approval process for future products or product modifications  it could delay or prevent release of the proposed products or modifications  which could harm our business 
the fda requires device manufacturers to make their own determination of whether or not a modification requires an approval or clearance  however  the fda can review a manufacturer s decision not to submit for additional approvals or clearances 
any modification to an fda approved or cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new premarket approval or k clearance 
the fda has recently issued a draft guidance that  if finalized  will result in manufacturers needing to seek a significant number of new or additional clearances for changes made to legally marketed devices 
we cannot assure you that the fda will agree with our decisions not to seek approvals or clearances for particular device modifications or that we will be successful in obtaining premarket approvals or k clearances for modifications 
we have obtained k clearance for the cyberknife system for the treatment of tumors anywhere in the body where radiation is indicated  and we have obtained k clearance for the tomotherapy systems to be used as integrated systems for the planning and delivery of imrt for the treatment of cancer 
the tomotherapy systems provide precise delivery of radiation to tumors while minimizing the delivery of radiation to vital healthy tissue 
the tomotherapy systems deliver the radiation therapy  or stereotactic radiotherapy or radiosurgery  treatment in accordance with the physician approved plan using imrt techniques delivered in a helical tomographic pattern 
we have made modifications to the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional approvals or clearances 
if the fda disagrees  based on new finalized guidance and requires us to obtain additional premarket approvals or k clearances for any modifications to the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems and we fail to obtain such approvals or clearances or fail to secure approvals or clearances in a timely manner  we may be required to cease manufacturing and marketing the modified device or to recall such modified device until we obtain fda approval or clearance and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
in addition  even if the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems are not modified  the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design  
table of contents manufacture or labeling 
a government mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling and user manuals 
we have voluntarily conducted recalls and product corrections in the past  including four such recalls for the cyberknife systems  and two such recalls for the tomotherapy systems  during fiscal year each of these recalls was voluntarily initiated by accuray 
to date  no serious health consequences have been reported in connection with these recalls  and the costs associated with each such recall were not material 
we cannot ensure that the fda will not require that we take additional actions to address problems that resulted in previous recalls 
any recall could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant expenses  generate negative publicity  harm our reputation with customers  negatively affect our future sales and business  require redesign of the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  and harm our operating results 
in these circumstances  we may also be subject to significant enforcement action 
if any of these events were to occur  our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner would be adversely affected  which in turn would harm our future growth 
if we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information that we possess  we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties  which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business 
there are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information  including patient records  and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information 
in particular  the us department of health and human services has promulgated patient privacy rules under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
these privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information of patients by limiting their use and disclosure  giving patients the right to access  amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most uses and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose 
although we are not a covered entity under hipaa  we have entered into agreements with certain covered entities under which we are considered to be a business associate under hipaa 
as a business associate  we are required to implement policies  procedures and reasonable and appropriate physical  technical and administrative security measures to protect individually identifiable health information we receive from covered entities 
our failure to protect health information received from customers could subject us to liability to both the government and the covered entity  adverse publicity  and could harm our business and impair our ability to attract new customers 
the hipaa privacy standard was amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech  enacted as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of hitech significantly increases the civil money penalties for violations of patient privacy rights protected under hipaa 
furthermore  as of february  business associates who have access to patient health information provided by hospitals and healthcare providers are now directly subject to hipaa  including a new enforcement scheme and inspection requirements 
moreover  we manufacture and sell products that allow our customers to store confidential information about their patients 
while we have implemented security measures to protect our products from unauthorized access  these measures do not secure our customers equipment or any information stored in our customers systems or at their locations 
a breach of network security and systems or other events that cause the loss or public disclosure of  or access by third parties to  our customers stored information could have serious negative consequences for our business  including possible fines  penalties and damages  reduced demand for our solutions  an unwillingness of our customers to use our solutions  harm to our reputation and brand  and time consuming and expensive litigation  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents certain governmental agencies  such as the us department of health and human services and the federal trade commission  have the authority to protect against the misuse of consumer information by targeting companies that collect  disseminate or maintain personal information in an unfair or deceptive manner 
we are also subject to the laws of those foreign jurisdictions in which we sell the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  some of which currently have more protective privacy laws 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations in this area  our business and prospects could be harmed 
if we or our distributors do not obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a specific country  we will not be able to market and sell our products in that country 
to be able to market and sell our products in a specific country  we or our distributors must comply with applicable laws and regulations of that country 
in jurisdictions where we rely on our distributors to manage the regulatory process  we are dependent on their ability to do so effectively 
while the laws and regulations of some countries do not impose barriers to marketing and selling our products or only require notification  others require that we or our distributors obtain the approval of a specified regulatory body 
these laws and regulations  including the requirements for approvals  and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country 
the governmental agencies regulating medical devices in some countries  for example  require that the user interface on medical device software be in the local language 
we currently provide user guides and manuals  both paper copies and electronically  in the local language but only provide an english language version of the user interface 
obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive and time consuming  and we cannot be certain that we or our distributors will receive regulatory approvals in each country in which we market or plan to market our products 
if we modify our products  we or our distributors may need to apply for additional regulatory approvals before we are permitted to sell them 
we may not continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the authorizations that we or our distributors have received 
it can also be costly for us and our distributors to keep up with regulatory changes issued or mandated from time to time 
if we change distributors  it may be time consuming and disruptive to our business to transfer the required regulatory approvals  particularly if such approvals are maintained by our third party distributors on our behalf 
if we or our distributors are unable to maintain our authorizations  or fail to obtain appropriate authorizations in a particular country  we will no longer be able to sell our products in that country  and our ability to generate revenue will be materially adversely affected 
within the european union  we are required under the medical device directive to affix the conformit europ ene  or ce  mark on our products in order to sell the products in member countries of the eu 
this conformity to the applicable directives is done through self declaration and is verified by an independent certification body  called a notified body  before the ce mark can be placed on the device 
once the ce mark is affixed to the device  the notified body will regularly audit us to ensure that we remain in compliance with the applicable european laws or directives 
ce marking demonstrates that our products comply with the laws and regulations required by the european union countries to allow free movement of trade within those countries 
if we cannot support our performance claims and or demonstrate or maintain compliance with the applicable european laws and directives  we lose our ce mark  which would prevent us from selling our products within the european union 
under the pharmaceutical affairs law in japan  a pre market approval necessary to sell  market and import a product  or shonin  must be obtained from the ministry of health  labor and welfare  or mhlw  for our products 
before issuing approvals  mhlw examines the application in detail with regard to the quality  efficacy  and safety of the proposed medical device 
the shonin is granted once mhlw is content with the safety and effectiveness of the medical device 
the time required for 
table of contents approval varies 
a delay in approval could prevent us from selling our products in japan  which could impact our ability to generate revenue and harm our business 
in addition to laws and regulations regarding medical devices  we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations regulating our operations  including those relating to the use  generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials  which laws impose compliance costs on our business and can also result in liability to us 
for example  we are in the process of updating the way our products are built such that they will be compliant with the recast directive on restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment  or the rohs directive  which applies to medical devices beginning in july the recast rohs directive bans the placing on the eu market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than certain levels of lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyl pbb and polybrominated diphenyl ether pbde 
if we fail to meet the requirements of the recast rohs directive  we may be prevented from selling our products within the european union 
we are required to comply with federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and if we are unable to comply with such laws  we could face substantial penalties and we could be excluded from government healthcare programs  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are directly or indirectly through our customers  subject to various federal  state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse 
these laws  which directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business primarily include  but are not limited to  the following the federal anti kickback statute  which prohibits persons from soliciting  offering  receiving or providing remuneration  directly or indirectly  in cash or in kind  to induce either the referral of an individual  or furnishing or arranging for a good or service  for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid  state law equivalents to the anti kickback statute  which may not be limited to government reimbursed items  the ethics in patient referral act of  also known as the stark law  which prohibits  subject to certain exceptions  physician referrals of medicare and medicaid patients to an entity providing certain designated health services if the physician or an immediate family member has any financial relationship with the entity 
the stark law also prohibits the entity receiving the referral from billing for any good or service furnished pursuant to an unlawful referral  state law equivalents to the stark law  which may provide even broader restrictions and require greater disclosures than the federal law  the federal false claims act  which prohibits the knowing filing or causing the filing of a false claim or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government  and similar laws in foreign countries where we conduct business 
the physician payment sunshine act sunshine act  which was enacted by congress as part of the patient protection and affordable care act on dec 
  requires medical device companies such as accuray to track payments and all transfers of value greater than to licensed physicians in the us final regulations for the tracking and reporting of payments and transfers of value to licensed physicians have not been finalized  but it is anticipated that companies must begin tracking payments beginning january  and must begin reporting payments to the government by march  after receiving reports of payments and transfers of value  the government plans to post that data on a public searchable government maintained website 
failure to comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed by the sunshine act can result in civil monetary penalties ranging from 
table of contents  to  for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported up to a maximum of  and from  to  for each knowing failure to report up to a maximum of million 
the following arrangements with purchasers and their agents have been identified by the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services as ones raising potential risk of violation of the federal anti kickback statute discount and free good arrangements that are not properly disclosed or accurately reported to federal healthcare programs  product support services  including billing assistance  reimbursement consultation  marketing and other services specifically tied to support of the purchased product  offered in tandem with another service or program such as reimbursement guarantee that confers a benefit to the purchaser  educational grants conditioned in whole or in part on the purchase of equipment  or otherwise inappropriately influenced by sales and marketing considerations  research funding arrangements  particularly post market research activities  that are linked directly or indirectly to the purchase of products or services  or otherwise inappropriately influenced by sales and marketing considerations  and other offers of remuneration to purchasers that are expressly or impliedly related to a sale or sales volume  such as prebates and upfront payment  other free or reduced price goods or services  and payments to cover costs of converting from a competitor s products  particularly where the selection criteria for such offers vary with the volume or value of business generated 
we have various arrangements with physicians  hospitals and other entities which implicate these laws 
for example  physicians who own our stock also provide medical advisory and other consulting and personal services 
similarly  we have a variety of different types of arrangements with our customers 
for example  our shared ownership program entails the provision of our products to our customers under a deferred payment program  where we generally receive the greater of a fixed minimum payment or a portion of the revenues of services 
included in the fee we charge for the placement and shared ownership program are a variety of services  including physician training  educational and marketing support  general reimbursement guidance and technical support 
in the past  we have also provided loans to our customers 
we also provide research grants to customers to support customer studies related to  among other things  our cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
certain of these arrangements do not meet anti kickback statute safe harbor protections  which may result in increased scrutiny by government authorities having responsibility for enforcing these laws 
if our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other similar governmental regulations to which we or our customers are subject  we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation  including significant civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  imprisonment and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the impact of any such violations may lead to curtailment or restructuring of our operations  which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
the risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are open to a variety of interpretations 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses  divert our management s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 
if enforcement action were to occur  our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed  even if we were to prevail or settle the action 
similarly  if the physicians or other providers or entities with which we do business are found to be non compliant with applicable laws  they may be subject to sanctions  which could also have a negative impact on our business 

table of contents healthcare reform legislation could adversely affect demand for our products  our revenue and our financial condition 
healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade 
there have been and continue to be proposals by legislators  regulators  and third party payors to keep these costs down 
certain proposals  if passed  may impose limitations on the coverage or amounts of reimbursement available for our products from governmental agencies or third party payors 
these limitations could have a negative impact on the demand for our products and services  and therefore on our financial position and results of operations and a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
on march   the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law  and on march   the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law 
together  the two measures make the most sweeping and fundamental changes to the us health care system since the creation of medicare and medicaid 
the health care reform laws include a large number of health related provisions to take effect over the next four years  including expanding medicaid eligibility  requiring most individuals to have health insurance  establishing new regulations on health plans  establishing health insurance exchanges  requiring manufacturers to report payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  modifying certain payment systems to encourage more cost effective care and a reduction of inefficiencies and waste and including new tools to address fraud and abuse 
there continue to be many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood  and it is unclear what the full impact of the legislation will be 
effective in  there will be a excise tax on us sales of medical devices 
us net sales represented of our worldwide net sales in  and therefore  this tax burden may have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flow 
in addition  various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level 
we cannot predict the exact effect newly enacted laws or any future legislation or regulation will have on us 
however  the implementation of new legislation and regulation may materially lower reimbursements for our products  materially reduce medical procedure volumes and significantly and adversely affect our business 
future legislative or regulatory changes to the healthcare system may affect our business 
in the united states  there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposals to change the healthcare system  and some could involve changes that significantly affect our business 
in addition  certain federal regulatory changes occur at least annually 
in april  at the time cms published final medicare inpatient reimbursement rates  cms issued final rules implementing significant amendments to the regulations under the federal ethics in patient referrals act  which is more commonly known as the stark law  with an effective date of october  these regulations  among other things  impose additional limitations on the ability of physicians to refer patients to medical facilities in which the physician has an ownership interest for treatment 
among other things  the regulations provide that leases of equipment between physician owners that may refer patients and hospitals must be on a fixed rate  rather than on a per use basis 
physician owned entities have increasingly become involved in the acquisition of medical technologies  including the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems 
in many cases  these entities enter into arrangements with hospitals that bill medicare for the furnishing of medical services  and the physician owners are among the physicians who refer patients to the entity for services 
the regulations limit these arrangements and could require the restructuring of existing arrangements between physicians owned entities and hospitals and may also discourage physicians from participating in the acquisition and ownership of medical technologies 
as a result of the finalization of these regulations  some existing cyberknife and tomotherapy system operators may have to modify or restructure their 
table of contents corporate or organizational structures 
in addition  certain existing customers that planned to open cyberknife or tomotherapy centers in the united states involving physician ownership could also have to restructure 
accordingly  these regulations could reduce the attractiveness of medical technology acquisitions  including cyberknife and tomotherapy system purchases  by physician owned joint ventures or similar entities 
as a result  these regulations could have an adverse impact on our product sales and therefore on our business and results of operations 
on june and   the fda held a public meeting entitled device improvements to reduce the number of under doses  over doses  and misaligned exposures from therapeutic radiation 
the expressed purpose of the meeting was to discuss steps that could be taken by manufacturers of radiation therapy devices to help reduce misadministration and misaligned exposures that have been reported in the press 
in advance of and at the meeting  the fda requested comments in the following areas features that should be incorporated into radiation therapy devices and their related software  user training  and quality assurance measures 
it is likely that the fda will use the information gleaned at this meeting to significantly revise the standards and requirements for designing  manufacturing and marketing devices such as ours  creating uncertainty in the current regulatory environment around our current products and development of future products 
future legislative or policy initiatives directed at reducing costs could be introduced at either the federal or state level 
we cannot predict what healthcare reform legislation or regulations  if any  will be enacted in the united states or elsewhere  what impact any legislation or regulations related to the healthcare system that may be enacted or adopted in the future might have on our business  or the effect of ongoing uncertainty or public perception about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers 
risks related to our common stock our major stockholders own approximately and directors and executive officers own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of june   which could limit other stockholders ability to influence the outcome of key transactions  including changes of control 
as of june   our current holders of or more of our outstanding common stock  held  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock while our directors and executive officers held  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
this concentration of ownership may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of our company and will make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
the price of our common stock is volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly  which could lead to losses for stockholders 
the trading prices of the stock of high technology companies of our size can experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations often have been unrelated or out of proportion to the operating performance of these companies 
our stock price has experienced periods of volatility 
broad market fluctuations may also harm our stock price 
any negative change in the public s perception of the prospects of companies that employ similar technology or sell into similar markets could also depress our stock price  regardless of our actual results 
in addition to the other risk factors described above and below  factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include regulatory developments related to manufacturing  marketing or sale of the cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  our ability to successfully integrate the tomotherapy acquisition  economic changes and overall market volatility  
table of contents political or social uncertainties  changes in product pricing policies  variations in our operating results  as well as costs and expenditures  changes in our operating results as a result of problems with our internal controls  announcements of technological innovations  new services or service enhancements  strategic alliances or significant agreements by us or by our competitors  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analyst that elects to follow our common stock  market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole  sales of large blocks of our common stock  and changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles  which could affect our financial results 
the acquisition of tomotherapy may not be accretive and may cause dilution to our earnings per share  which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
we currently anticipate that the acquisition of tomotherapy will be accretive to our earnings per share on an adjusted earnings basis in our fiscal year beginning july  this expectation is based on current estimates  which may change materially 
we may also encounter additional transaction related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition 
all of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
future issuances of shares of our common stock or substantial sales of our common stock by our stockholders  including sales pursuant to b plans  could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
any issuance of equity securities could dilute the interests of our stockholders and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock 
we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy including in connection with acquisitions  strategic collaborations or other transactions  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 
on august   we issued million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due  which we refer to as the convertible notes 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in our company or by any hedging or arbitrage trading activity that involves our common stock 
to the extent we issue common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes  that conversion would dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 
moreover  if our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock  including sales pursuant to b plans  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
these sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

table of contents increased leverage as a result of the convertible notes offering may harm our financial condition and operating results 
as of june   we had total consolidated long term liabilities of approximately million  including the liability component of the convertible notes in the amount of million 
our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to stockholders and note holders  because it could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations under the convertible notes  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations  working capital  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes  it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future  it may limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business  our industry or the economy in general 
the conditional conversion features of the convertible notes  if triggered  may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
in the event the conditional conversion features of the convertible notes are triggered  holders of the convertible notes will be entitled to convert the convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option 
if one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes  unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock other than paying solely cash in lieu of any fractional share  including if we have irrevocably elected full physical settlement upon conversion  we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy all or a portion of our conversion obligation based on the applicable conversion rate  which could adversely affect our liquidity 
in addition  even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes  if we have irrevocably elected net share settlement upon conversion we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the convertible notes as a current rather than long term liability  which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital 
provisions in the indenture for the convertible notes  our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition would be beneficial in the opinion of our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial in the opinion of our stockholders 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt  establishing a classified board of directors  which could discourage a takeover attempt  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would limit the ability of less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  limiting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent and requiring that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders  and 
table of contents establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
generally  section prohibits stockholders who  alone or together with their affiliates and associates  own more than of the subject company from engaging in certain business combinations for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder of such subject company without approval of the board or of the independent stockholders 
the existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
furthermore  if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the convertible notes occurs  holders of the convertible notes will have the right  at their option  to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes 
a fundamental change generally occurs when there is a change in control of the company acquisition of or more of our voting stock  liquidation or sale of the company not for stock or trading of our stock is terminated 
in the event of a make whole fundamental change as defined in the indenture for the convertible notes  we may also be required to increase the conversion rate applicable to convertible notes surrendered for conversion in connection with such make whole fundamental change 
a make whole fundamental change is generally a sale of the company not for stock in another publicly traded company 
in addition  the indenture for the convertible notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless  among other things  the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the convertible notes 
we have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations  capital requirements  financial condition  prospects  contractual arrangements  and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant 
if we do not pay dividends  a return on a stockholders investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates

overview products and markets we believe we are the premier radiation oncology company based on our history of rapid innovation and our leading edge technologies designed specifically to deliver radiosurgery  stereotactic body radiation therapy  intensity modulated radiation therapy  image guided radiation therapy and adaptive radiation therapy that is tailored to the specific needs of each patient 
our suite of products includes the cyberknife systems and the tomotherapy systems 
the systems are highly complementary offerings  serving distinct patient populations treated by the same medical specialty 
the cyberknife systems are robotic systems designed to deliver radiosurgery treatments to cancer tumors anywhere in the body 
they are the only dedicated  full body radiosurgery systems on the market 
radiosurgery is an alternative to traditional surgery for tumors and is performed on an outpatient basis in one to five treatment sessions 
it allows for the treatment of patients who otherwise would not be treated with radiation  who may not be good candidates for surgery  or who desire non surgical treatments 
the use of radiosurgery with cyberknife systems to treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly in recent years  but currently represents only a small portion of the patients who develop tumors treatable with cyberknife systems 
a determination of when it may or may not be appropriate to use a cyberknife system for treatment is at the discretion of the treating physician and depends on the specific patient 
however  given the cyberknife systems design to treat focal tumors  the cyberknife systems are generally not used to treat very large tumors  which are considerably wider than the radiation beam that can be delivered by cyberknife systems  diffuse  wide spread disease  as is often the case for late stage cancers  because they are not localized though cyberknife systems might be used to treat a focal area of the disease and systemic disease  like leukemias and lymphomas  which are not localized to an organ  but rather involve cells throughout the body 
we believe that the long term success of the cyberknife system is dependent on a number of factors including the following change in medical practice to utilize radiosurgery more regularly as an alternative to surgery or other treatments  greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiosurgery with the cyberknife systems  continued evolution in clinical studies demonstrating the safety  efficacy and other benefits of using the cyberknife systems to treat tumors in various parts of the body  continued advances in technology that improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of the cyberknife systems  improved access to radiosurgery with the cyberknife systems in various countries through regulatory approvals  
table of contents medical insurance reimbursement policies that cover cyberknife system treatments  and expansion of sales of cyberknife systems in countries throughout the world 
the tomotherapy systems are advanced  fully integrated and versatile radiation therapy systems for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types 
we began selling tomotherapy systems after our acquisition of tomotherapy incorporated on june  radiation therapy is used in a variety of ways  often to treat tissue surrounding a tumor area after surgical removal of the tumor and also as the primary treatment for tumors 
radiation therapy treatments impact both cancer cells as well as healthy tissue  therefore the total prescribed radiation dose is divided into many fractions and delivered in an average of to treatment sessions over several weeks 
radiation therapy has been widely available and used in developed countries for decades  though many developing countries do not currently have a sufficient number of radiation therapy systems to adequately treat their domestic cancer patient populations 
the number of radiation therapy systems in use and sold each year is currently many times larger than the number of radiosurgery systems 
large companies  including varian medical systems  inc and elekta ab  generate most sales in this market 
we believe the tomotherapy systems offer clinicians and patients significant benefits over other radiation therapy systems in the market 
we believe our ability to capture more sales in this established market will be influenced by a number of factors including the following greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiation therapy using tomotherapy systems  advances in technology which improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of tomotherapy systems  greater awareness among doctors of the improvement in reliability of tomotherapy systems  and expansion of tomotherapy system sales in countries throughout the world 
sale of our products generating revenue from the sale of our systems is a lengthy process 
selling our systems  from first contact with a potential customer to a signed sales contract  that meets backlog criteria  generally spans six months to two years 
the time from receipt of a signed contract to revenue recognition is governed generally by the time required by the customer to build  renovate or prepare the treatment room for installation of the system 
this time varies significantly  generally from six to twenty four months 
in the united states  we market to customers  including hospitals and stand alone treatment facilities  directly through our sales organization 
outside the united states  we market to customers in over countries directly and through distributors 
we have sales and service offices in japan and many countries in europe and asia 
the following table shows the number of systems installed by geographic region as of june  americas europe asia excluding japan japan total 
table of contents international sales of our products account for a significant and growing portion of our total net revenue 
revenue derived from sales outside of the united states was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
international sales as a percentage of our total net revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we believe the increase in international sales for the year ended june  is due to a number of factors  including the following inclusion of sales of tomotherapy products and services for the full fiscal year  increased focus on international markets through regionalization  different impact of the economic downturn by country  greater significance of government affiliated hospital customers  different competitive dynamics  and growth in select country markets 
backlog since the start of fiscal the fiscal year beginning july   we have been reporting backlog in a manner that is common for all of our products and services 
products orders for systems  upgrades  and our shared ownership program will be reported in backlog  excluding amounts attributable to warranty service  training and installation 
service orders for service  warranty  installation  training and other non recurring services will not be reported in backlog 
previously  orders for service were reported in backlog for cyberknife systems but not for tomotherapy systems 
for orders that cover both products and services  only the portion of the order that is recognized as product revenue is reported as backlog 
the portion of the order that is recognized as service revenue for example  warranty service  training and installation is not included in reported backlog 
additionally  orders for tomotherapy systems made on or before june   that met the historical tomotherapy backlog criteria have been grandfathered into  and are included in  our backlog  with the exception of orders that would have aged out as of june  tomotherapy previously did not have an age out criteria  so we have adjusted the tomotherapy backlog to age out orders where years have passed from the time the order entered tomotherapy s backlog 
as of june   product only backlog was million in total 
this amount is calculated based on the criteria set forth below and therefore is not comparable to backlog amounts reported for cyberknife or tomotherapy systems prior to fiscal  which were calculated using different criteria 
accordingly  we have not included  for comparison purposes  backlog amounts as of june  for either cyberknife or tomotherapy systems  due to the changes in methodology 
beginning with july   in order for the product portion of a sales agreement to be counted as backlog  it must meet the following criteria the contract is signed and properly executed by both the customer and us 
a customer purchase order that is signed and incorporates the terms of our contract quote will be considered equivalent to a signed and executed contract  the contract is non contingent it either has cleared all its contingencies or contains no contingencies when signed  we have received a minimum deposit or a letter of credit  the sale is a direct channel sale to a government entity  or the product has shipped to a customer with credit sufficient to cover the minimum deposit  the specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment  and less than years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above 

table of contents although our backlog includes only contractual agreements from our customers to purchase cyberknife systems or tomotherapy systems  we cannot provide assurance that we will convert backlog into recognized revenue due to factors outside our control  which includes  without limitation  changes in customers needs or financial condition  changes in government or health insurance reimbursement policies  changes to regulatory requirements  or other reasons for cancellation of orders 
we also use book to bill ratios to assess the quality and growth of our backlog 
the ratio is calculated for a period as new orders booked and included in backlog upon meeting criteria described above less any orders cancelled from backlog  and the resultant net orders being divided by total product revenue recognized during that period 
material weakness in internal control in connection with our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended june   we identified a material weakness relating to our accounting for significant  non routine transactions 
during the year ended june   we took the following corrective actions to remediate the previously reported material weakness in internal control over financial reporting we hired several finance personnel which has provided us with the appropriate resources and technical skills to ensure that the period end financial close and reporting processes are completed in an adequate and reliable manner 
we implemented a practice pursuant to which we consulted with  and will continue to consult with external subject matter experts as necessary prior to execution of any significant  non routine transactions in order to validate the accounting approach to be taken with respect to such transactions 
as a result of the implementation of these remediation measures  management determined that the material weakness described above was successfully remediated and no longer existed as of june  although we have successfully remediated previously reported material weaknesses as well as other significant deficiencies and control deficiencies  we cannot assure you that we have identified all  or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses  significant deficiencies and control deficiencies 
results of operations years ended june   and we acquired tomotherapy on june  therefore our results for the fiscal year ended june  include revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses of the tomotherapy subsidiary for the day period from the acquisition date to the end of the fiscal year  while results for the year ended june  includes revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses of the tomotherapy subsidiary for the full fiscal year

fy products services other net revenue total net revenue for fiscal increased million from fiscal primarily due to the addition of million of revenue related to our tomotherapy system and related services and increases in our cyberknife service revenue by million 
this was partially offset by decreases in the cyberknife systems revenues by million 
product revenue increased by million as it includes million of revenue from the sale of tomotherapy systems during fiscal as compared to million of revenue from the sale of tomotherapy systems from the close of the acquisition on june  until the end of fiscal cyberknife system revenues decreased by million primarily due to a decrease in revenue by three units  lower average revenue per system due to changes in the mix of products sold  increases in revenue deferrals for systems sold with extended payment terms  and decreases in revenue from treatment vault construction 
this revenue decline was related to shipment schedules in the european region and a decline in new orders in the americas region  offset partially by increases in our apac and japan regions 
additionally  we recognized nil and million of revenue from the sale of a shared ownership system in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue was recognized on cyberknife units during fiscal as compared to units in fiscal during fiscal  we placed system orders into backlog and shipped systems 
the number of new orders increased for both cyberknife and tomotherapy systems in our international market but were offset by a decline in orders for systems in the us market 
services revenue increased by million due to the addition of million of revenue generated from service of tomotherapy systems and an increase of million of revenue generated from service of cyberknife systems due to increases in the installed base 
during the year ended june   million of the write up of deferred service revenue was recognized as service revenue as compared to million recognized during the year ended june  we anticipate the balance of this write up will be recognized as service revenue through the first quarter of fiscal we expect the majority of revenue during fiscal to occur in the second half of the fiscal year due to potential shipment delays as customers wait for our next technology release and the normalization of tomotherapy system shipments from the unseasonably high level seen in the first quarter following the acquisition 
we expect the primary impact on our product revenues from these factors during the first quarter of fiscal total net revenue for fiscal increased million from fiscal to million 
this includes million of net revenue from the sale of tomotherapy systems and services from the close of the acquisition on june  through june  million of products revenue  million of services revenue  and million of other revenue 
revenue recognized from arrangements previously deferred on cyberknife systems sold with a platinum service agreement declined to million during fiscal from million in fiscal 
table of contents excluding million of revenue previously deferred under platinum service agreements  service revenue totaled million for fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal service revenue excluding revenue from platinum service agreements 
this increase was the result of continued growth in our installed base of cyberknife systems covered by service plans and the addition of service revenue for tomotherapy systems 
other revenue increased due to facility construction work that we managed for customers in fiscal gross profit years ended june  dollars in thousands of net revenue dollars in thousands of net revenue dollars in thousands of net revenue gross profit products services other our gross profit margin for fiscal was percentage points lower than the gross profit margin during fiscal this decline was due principally to the lower gross profit margin of on tomotherapy revenues included in our results of operations for the year ended june  the gross profit margin on cyberknife revenues was during the year ended june  as compared to during the year ended june  due to margins declining by percentage points on product revenues from changes in product mix which was partially offset by margins on service revenues increasing by percentage points due to lower service cost per unit as the install base increases 
in accordance with purchase accounting standards  a number of adjustments were recorded to the value of assets and liabilities of tomotherapy as of the closing of the acquisition on june  these included the write up of inventory based on selling price rather than cost of manufacturing  the write down of deferred product revenue  the write up of deferred service revenue  and the recording of intangible assets related to developed technology and to backlog existing at the time of the acquisition 
on the acquisition date  deferred service and product revenues were valued at cost plus a reasonable margin 
purchase accounting adjustments reduced gross profit for fiscal by million as follows product revenues were reduced by million while product cost of revenues was increased by million  services revenues were increased by million while services cost of revenues was increased by million 
we expect that the impact of purchase accounting adjustments  other than the amortization of intangible assets assigned to developed technology and to distributor licenses  to be significantly smaller in fiscal and be mostly completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal the impact of the purchase accounting adjustments of million of intangible assets assigned to backlog will be charged to cost of revenues over a month period from acquisition through august the million of intangible assets assigned to developed technology will be charged to cost of revenues over a six year period from acquisition through fiscal the million of intangible assets assigned to distributor license will be charged to cost of revenues over a year period from acquisition through december our gross profit margin was higher by percentage points in fiscal than in fiscal due to the improved margin on products revenue  offset partially by a reduction in the gross profit margin on services revenue 
the improvement in our overall gross profit margin was limited by negative gross profit margin associated with the tomotherapy revenues included in our results from the close of the acquisition on june  through june  
table of contents the gross profit margin on products revenue rose by percentage points due mainly to the commencement of shipments of our newest cyberknife model  the cyberknife vsi  which sold for a higher average price than the predecessor model  the g the higher average price  combined with improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions  resulted in a higher gross profit margin on the cyberknife vsi model  which accounted for the majority of product sales in fiscal the gross profit margin on services revenue declined by percentage points due to the inclusion in our fiscal results of tomotherapy services revenue for the period from june through june  the tomotherapy services revenue incurred a negative gross margin in our financial statements during this period 
excluding the results of tomotherapy during this day period  the gross profit margin on service in fiscal was approximately unchanged from fiscal due to the adjustments made to assets and liabilities of tomotherapy as of the closing of the acquisition on june   the resultant entries to revenues and cost of revenues caused the results from the sale of tomotherapy products and services for the period june to june  to reflect a negative gross margin 
product revenues were reduced by million while product cost of revenues was increased by million

fy provision for benefit from income taxes     nm of income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes nm not meaningful the provision for income taxes was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increased earnings in international locations 
the provision for income taxes was higher in fiscal compared to fiscal due to million of additional foreign taxes resulting from higher international revenue in fiscal combined with a federal tax benefit of million recorded in fiscal resulting from enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which permits some relief from federal alternative minimum tax 
at june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts and will begin to expire in for federal and for state purposes  respectively 
such net operating loss carryforwards include tax benefits from employee stock option exercises in excess of the share based compensation expense that has been recognized for these awards 
we will record approximately million as a credit to additional paid in capital if and when such excess benefits are ultimately realized 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal research credits will begin to expire in  the california research credits have no expiration date  and the other state research credits begin to expire in realization of the deferred tax assets  among other factors  is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
due to the inconsistent history of net operating income as adjusted for permanent differences  we cannot conclude that the net domestic deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred tax assets 
at june   there was no provision for us income tax for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us if repatriated  these earnings could result in a tax expense at the current us federal statutory tax rate of  subject to available net operating losses and other factors 
subject to limitation  tax on undistributed earnings may also be reduced by foreign tax credits that may be generated in connection with the repatriation of earnings

performance based awards during fiscal  the compensation committee of our board of directors of the company approved the granting of performance based stock units psus to employees of the company which vest only upon meeting certain financial performance criteria during the performance period commencing on the first day of our fiscal year and ending on the last day of our fiscal year 
in the event that the psus do not become vested as a result of the company s performance during the performance period  all psus are automatically forfeited by the participants effective as of the last day of the performance period 
during the year ended june   approximately million psus have been granted to employees valued at approximately million which was based on the fair value of the company s common stock on the grant date and will be recognized over the requisite performance period based on our assessment of the probability of achieving the performance criteria 
approximately million psus are outstanding as of june  as of june   we have assessed that it was not probable that the performance criteria would be met during the performance period and accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for the psus during the year ended june  if in a future period management revises its assessment and concludes that it is probable that the performance criteria will be met  we will record a cumulative catch up compensation charge for the psus in that period 
remaining compensation charges for the psus would be recognized ratably over the remaining performance period 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we anticipate that we will begin to turn profitable and generate positive cash flow in the fourth quarter of fiscal cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks included in part i  item a titled risk factors 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that we will have sufficient cash resources and anticipated cash flows to continue in operation for at least the next months 
on july   we paid approximately million in cash to acquire all of the remaining outstanding equity of morphormics  inc that we did not previously own 
morphormics is a privately held developer of medical imaging software 
refer to note  subsequent events  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we do not expect this acquisition to have a significant impact on our anticipated cash flows for at least the next months 
convertible notes on august   we issued million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes to certain qualified institutional buyers or qibs 
the convertible notes were offered and sold to the qibs pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and commission and related offering costs were approximately million 
the offering costs and the initial purchaser s discount and commission which are recorded in other assets are both being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over five years 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on february and august of each year  beginning on february  the convertible notes will mature on august   unless earlier repurchased  redeemed or converted

in accordance with asc debt with conversion and other options  we separately account for the liability and equity conversion components of the convertible notes 
the principal amount of the liability component of the convertible notes was million as of date of issuance  which was based on the present value of its cash flows using a discount rate of  our approximate borrowing rate at the date of the issuance for a similar debt instrument without the conversion feature 
the carrying value of the equity conversion component was million 
a portion of the initial purchaser s discount and commission and the offering costs totaling million was allocated to the equity conversion component 
the liability component will be accreted to the principal amount of the convertible notes using the effective interest method over five years 

table of contents years ended june   and cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities during was million which was attributable to the net loss of million and cash used for working capital purposes of million  partially offset by million of non cash charges 
non cash charges primarily included million of depreciation and amortization expenses  million of share based compensation expense  accretion of interest expense on the convertible notes of million  million for provision for write down of inventories and million for provision for bad debts 
cash used for working capital was primarily attributed to million of increases in accounts receivables due to increased billings  decreases in accounts payable of million due to timing of vendor payments  decreases in accrued liabilities of million due to payments for acquisition related  value added tax related  and other liabilities and decreases in customer advances of million due to lower minimum deposit requirements on new orders 
this was partially offset by decreases in inventories by million due to usage  decreases in prepayments by million mainly due to timing of payments and increases in deferred revenues by million due to increased shipment and billings as well as higher deferred service revenues from increases in installed base 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal our net loss of million contributed to the negative cash flows from working capital changes  including a decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue of million  an increase in inventories of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
this decrease was offset primarily by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in accounts payable was due to timing differences between the receipt of goods and service and vendor payments 
non cash charges included primarily million of share based compensation charges  million of depreciation and amortization expense  and write down of inventories of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal our net income of million during fiscal was offset by a decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the recognition of revenue previously deferred for systems sold under our platinum plan  partially offset by differences between invoicing customers for products and services and the recognition of the invoicing as revenue 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due to an insurance receivable amount recorded for insurance claims 
accounts payable decreased as a result of the timing of the receipt of invoices and when payment was made 
positive cash flow from working capital changes includes an increase of million of accrued liabilities  which was primarily due to an increase in compensation accruals and taxes payable due to higher profitability compared to the prior fiscal year 
non cash charges included million of share based compensation  million of charges for write down of inventories and loss on disposal of property and equipment  million reduction in the provision for bad debts and million of depreciation and amortization

in addition  we used million of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal and was attributable to net marketable security activities of million  which consisted of million of sales and maturities of marketable securities  offset by million in purchases 
the net increase in investment activity for fiscal was due to the exercise of the put option with ubs and the sale of our ars holdings on june  we used million of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was million

net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and the purchase of common stock under our espp 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following revenue generated by sales of our products  our shared ownership program and service plans  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  facilities  equipment and it systems required to support current and future operations  rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our products  effects of competing technological and market developments  number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions  and costs associated with the integration of tomotherapy 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million during fiscal if these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional financing may not be available at all  or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following is a schedule summarizing our obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible notes operating leases total these amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations  including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
any conversion  redemption or purchase of convertible notes would impact our cash payments 
our purchase commitments and obligations include all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  including commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers  for which we have not received the goods or services and acquisition and licensing of intellectual property 
a majority of these purchase obligations are due within a year 
although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services  and hence  have not been included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 
all of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  business combinations and intangible asset impairment  inventories  share based compensation expense  income taxes  loss contingencies and corporate bonus expenses and accruals 

table of contents revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements amendments to accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition  and asu  certain arrangements that include software elements amendments to financial accounting standards board  or fasb  asc topic  software 
we adopted these new standards on a prospective basis  therefore  they apply only to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning july  the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes it requires us to allocate revenues in an arrangement using best estimated selling prices  or besp  of deliverables if we do not have vsoe or third party evidence  or tpe  of selling price  and it eliminates the residual method and requires us to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the besp is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  internal costs  geographies and gross margin 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with our pricing committee  taking into consideration the overall go to market pricing strategy 
we may modify or develop new go to market practices in the future 
as these go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which may result in changes in selling prices  impacting both vsoe and besp 
these factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year  which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
in order to comply with gaap  we have to make a number of reasoned judgments with respect to elements of these sales arrangements  including how to allocate the proceeds received from an arrangement  whether there are multiple elements in the arrangement  whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements 
during fiscal and  we accounted for pre adoption multiple elements arrangements which have not subsequently been materially modified under the residual method and allocated arrangement consideration to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the respective elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element is based upon our historical standard rates charged for the product or service when such product or service is sold separately or based upon the price established by our management comprised pricing committee  which has the relevant authority when that product or service is not yet sold separately 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vsoe of the fair value for those elements could affect the timing and the amount of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on all or a combination of the timing of shipment  completion of installation  customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines  installation schedules are delayed or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
examples of the impact of these factors include the following 
if the shipment of one of our systems that sold for million was delayed  system revenue would be lowered by this million  less any amounts deferred for service  training  or other future deliverables 
if our cyberknife or tomotherapy systems were sold for between to million and the sale involved multiple elements including training and service  a change in besp of the systems could result in an approximately  to  impact to the amount of revenue allocated and recognized as product revenue rather than as service revenue 

table of contents business combinations and intangible asset impairment our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to business combinations is determined through established valuation techniques 
the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and appropriate discount rate for those cash flows 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators are present 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the impaired asset 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
inventories the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as damaged inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand to support future sales and service 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce purchasing and manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to write off inventory  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
for example  if the actual amount of inventory that is disposed of as obsolete  excess or damaged is larger or smaller than the amount that we estimated at june   then we would need to increase or decrease cost of sales by approximately million 
share based compensation expense we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business because we do not have sufficient trading history on our common stock 
when making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation  we also considered the stage of development  size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies 
in addition  as our historical share option exercise experience as a publicly held entity does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term  we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated by the simplified method 
the 
table of contents assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated forfeiture rate was higher or lower by five percentage points  our share based compensation expense related to stock options would increase or decrease by approximately  respectively 
income taxes we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions  respectively 
we have placed a full valuation allowance on all net us deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income cannot be reasonably assured 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
any decision to reverse part or all of the valuation allowance would be based on our estimate of future profitability 
if our estimate were to be wrong we could be required to charge potentially significant amounts to income tax expense to establish a new valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign countries  and we are subject to corporate income tax audits in some of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
however  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions is adequate 
we review our reserves quarterly  and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations or new case law  previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination  negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 

table of contents loss contingencies as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various lawsuits  claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount 
we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and updated information 
currently  we do not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect  we could incur significant charges related to legal matters which could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
corporate bonus expense and accruals we record accruals for estimated corporate bonus expense each quarter which is paid out in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
our expense accrual for each quarter during fiscal is based on our performance against each of these metrics net revenue  gross margin and orders to backlog 
if we underestimate or overestimate any of these metrics during any quarter  adjustments to bonus expense and accruals may be necessary in subsequent periods during the year 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
for direct sales outside the united states  we sell in both us dollars and local currencies  which could expose us to additional foreign currency risks  including changes in currency exchange rates 
our operating expenses in countries outside the united states  are payable in foreign currencies and therefore expose us to currency risk 
to the extent that management can predict the timing of payments under sales contracts or for operating expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies  we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate such risks in the future 
interest rate risk at june   we had million of cash equivalents invested in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
our earnings would not be materially affected by interest rate risk due to the low interest rate on these highly liquid investments 
equity price risk on august   we issued million aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes 
upon conversion  we can settle the obligation by issuing our common stock  cash or a combination thereof at an initial conversion rate equal to shares of common stock per  principal amount of the convertible notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock  subject to adjustment 
there is no equity price risk if the share price of our common stock is below upon conversion of the convertible notes 
for every that the share price of our common stock exceeds  we expect to issue an additional million in cash or shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof  if all of the convertible notes are converted
