table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto  as well as the business and risk factors sections of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services  which are provided throughout the united states and in canada  include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground facility locating services to various utilities  including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric and gas utilities and others 
for the fiscal year ended july   the percentage of our revenue by customer type from telecommunications  underground facility locating  and electric and gas utilities and other customers  was approximately   and  respectively 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  changes in the general level of construction activity  as well as overall economic conditions 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecommunications providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of our government and the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are performed under master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that extend for periods of one or more years 
we are currently party to numerous master service agreements  generally having multiple agreements with each of our customers 
master service agreements generally contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability of the customer to issue work orders valued above a specified dollar amount to other service providers  perform work with the customer s own employees  and use other service providers when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate an agreement for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services are provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for specific projects are generally of three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing may be withheld by the customer pending project completion 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
the following table summarizes our revenues from multi year master service agreements and other long term contracts  as a percentage of contract revenues fiscal year ended multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts the percentage of revenue from long term contracts varies between periods depending on the mix of work performed under our contracts 
during fiscal  a higher percentage of revenue was earned for services performed under short term contracts than in either of the prior two fiscal years  including work performed for certain rural broadband customers 
a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from those customers who contributed at least of our total revenue in fiscal  or fiscal year ended at t inc centurylink comcast corporation verizon communications inc windstream corporation charter communications  inc time warner cable inc 
table of contents for comparison purposes  revenues from centurylink  inc and qwest communications international  inc have been combined for periods prior to their april merger 
additionally  revenues from windstream corporation and kentucky data link  inc have been combined for periods prior to their december merger and revenues from time warner cable inc and insight communications company  inc 
have been combined for periods prior to their february merger 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for direct labor provided by employees  services by independent subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation and amortization  direct materials  insurance claims and other direct costs 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
for a majority of the contract services we perform  our customers provide all required materials while we provide the necessary personnel  tools  and equipment 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
general and administrative expenses include costs of management personnel and administrative overhead at our subsidiaries  as well as our corporate costs 
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  legal  consulting and professional fees  information technology and development costs  provision for or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to performance of our services under customer contracts 
our senior management  including the senior managers of our subsidiaries  perform substantially all of our sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
information technology and development costs included in general and administrative expenses are primarily incurred to support and to enhance our operating efficiency 
to protect our rights  we have filed for patents on certain of our innovations 
we are subject to concentrations of credit risk relating primarily to our cash and equivalents  trade accounts receivable  other receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
cash and equivalents primarily include balances on deposit in banks 
we maintain substantially all of our cash and equivalents at financial institutions we believe to be of high credit quality 
to date we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
we grant credit under normal payment terms  generally without collateral  to our customers 
these customers primarily consist of telephone companies  cable television multiple system operators  and electric and gas utilities 
with respect to a portion of the services provided to these customers  we have certain statutory lien rights which may  in certain circumstances  enhance our collection efforts 
adverse changes in overall business and economic factors may impact our customers and increase potential credit risks 
these risks may be heightened as a result of economic uncertainty and market volatility 
in the past  some of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties and likewise  some may experience financial difficulties in the future 
these difficulties expose us to increased risks related to the collectability of amounts due for services performed 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would materially impact the collectability of our trade accounts receivable and costs in excess of billings as of july  on may   a proposed settlement was reached with respect to two wage and hour class action lawsuits 
in connection with an agreement to settle the two lawsuits entered into by the company  prince telecom  llc prince  cavo broadband communications  llc  broadband express  llc bbx and the plaintiffs attorneys  the company recorded million in other accrued liabilities during the third quarter of fiscal the first of the two lawsuits  which commenced on june   was brought by a former employee of prince against prince  the company and certain unnamed us affiliates of prince and the company the affiliates in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the lawsuit alleged that prince  the company and the affiliates violated the fair labor standards act by failing to comply with applicable overtime pay requirements 
the plaintiff sought unspecified damages and other relief on behalf of himself and a putative class of similarly situated current and former employees of prince  the company and or the affiliates 
the second of the lawsuits  which commenced on september   was brought by two former employees of bbx against bbx in the united states district court for the southern district of florida 
the lawsuit alleged that bbx violated the fair labor standards act by failing to comply with applicable overtime pay requirements 
the plaintiffs sought unspecified damages and other relief on behalf of themselves and a putative class of similarly situated current and former employees of bbx 
on august   the united states district court for the southern district of new york issued an order approving the consolidation of the two lawsuits and approving the terms of the settlement  which was paid in december as part of our insurance program  we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages  and we have established reserves that we believe to be adequate based on current evaluations and our experience with these types of claims 
for these claims  the effect on our financial statements is generally limited to the amount needed to satisfy our insurance deductibles or retentions 
from time to time  we and our subsidiaries are parties to various other claims and legal proceedings 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that such other pending claims or proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify  acquire  and successfully integrate companies 
on november   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of communication services  inc communication services  a provider of outside plant construction services to telecommunications companies in the southeastern and south central united states 
the purchase price for communication services was million paid from cash on hand and the assumption of approximately million in capital lease obligations 
approximately million of the purchase price has been placed in escrow until november and will be used to satisfy indemnification obligations of the sellers that may arise 
on december   we acquired neocom solutions  inc neocom  based in woodstock  georgia 
neocom provides services to construct  install  optimize and maintain wireless communication facilities in the southeastern united states 
the purchase price for neocom was million paid from cash on hand 
the acquisitions were not material to the company 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable companies converge  growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services  and governmental broadband stimulus funding 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability 
telecommunications providers continue to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
these factors drive customer demand for our services 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services require the installation of customer premise equipment and at times the upgrade of in home wiring 
additionally  fiber deployments are also facilitating the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
several large telephone companies have pursued fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives to compete actively with cable operators 
these long term initiatives and the likelihood that other telephone companies pursue similar strategies present opportunities for us 
cable companies are continuing to target the provision of data and voice services to residential customers and have expanded their service offerings to business customers 
often times these services are provided over fiber optic cables using metro ethernet technology 
the commercial geographies that cable companies are targeting for network deployments generally require incremental fiber optic cable deployment and  as a result  require the type of engineering and construction services that we provide 
there are also significant opportunities to construct rural fiber networks throughout the country as a result of the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
arra originally allocated billion in funding to accelerate broadband deployment in rural areas of the country that have been without broadband infrastructure 
this funding included awards to many of our current and former customers 
these projects require engineering and construction resources and have meaningfully increased industry activity during fiscal and are expected to continue into fiscal in addition to projects specifically funded by the arra  a number of rural customers have continued to access funding provided by the rural utilities service to expand fiber networks in rural geographies 
these rural fiber deployments are expected to continue to drive demand for services in our industry 
there is significant demand for mobile broadband driven by the proliferation of smart phones and other wireless data devices 
this demand and other advances in technology have created the need for wireless carriers to upgrade their networks 
wireless carriers are actively spending on their networks to respond to the explosion in wireless data traffic  upgrade network technologies to improve performance and efficiency and consolidate disparate technology platforms 
these customer initiatives present long term opportunities for us for the wireless services we provide 
further  the demand for mobile broadband has increased bandwidth requirements on the wired networks of our customers 
as the demand for mobile broadband grows  the amount of cellular traffic that must be backhauled over customers fiber and coaxial networks increases and  as a result  carriers are accelerating the deployment of fiber optic cables to cellular sites 
these trends are increasing the demand for the types of services we provide 
additionally  we provide underground facility locating services to a variety of utility companies  including telecommunication providers 
underground facility locating is required prior to underground excavation and is impacted by overall economic activity 
underground excavation is required for the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power  water  sewer  and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
as a result  the level of outsourcing of this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity influence the demand for underground facility locating services 
within the context of a slowly growing economy and the current volatility in the credit and equity markets  we believe the latest trends and developments support our steady industry outlook 
we will continue to closely monitor the effects that changes in economic and market conditions may have on our customers and our business and we will continue to manage those areas of the business we can control 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis  the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long lived assets  income taxes  accrued insurance claims  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  allowance for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation expense for performance based stock awards  and accruals for contingencies  including legal matters 
these estimates and assumptions require the use of judgment as to the likelihood of various future outcomes and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in changes to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances each period 
this analysis considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we recognize an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
we believe that none of our significant customers were experiencing financial difficulties that would materially impact our trade accounts receivable or allowance for doubtful accounts as of july  goodwill and intangible assets 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
there was no goodwill impairment during fiscal  or we account for goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
our reporting units and related indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in accordance with asc topic in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value 
in addition  they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests  an impairment loss is recognized 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 

table of contents in accordance with asc topic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is determined based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
an impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of an asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations during the period incurred 
we use judgment in assessing if goodwill and intangible assets are impaired 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows taking into consideration historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions  as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
to measure fair value  we employ a combination of present value techniques which reflect market factors 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in significantly different estimates of fair value potentially resulting in additional impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units 
the profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business  the high level of competition existing within our industry  the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers  and the level of overall economic activity 
during times of slowing economic conditions  our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects 
individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole 
as a result  demand for the services of one or more of our reporting units could decline resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each of fiscal  and the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value estimates of our reporting units were a a discount rate based on our best estimate of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units  b terminal value based on terminal growth rates  and c seven expected years of cash flow before the terminal value for each annual test 
the table below outlines the key assumptions in each of our fiscal  and annual impairment analyses terminal growth rate range discount rate the discount rate reflects risks inherent within each reporting unit operating individually  which is greater than the risks inherent in the company as a whole 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis decreased compared to the rate used in the fiscal analysis as a result of reduced risk relative to industry conditions 
the discount rate used in the fiscal analysis decreased compared to the rate used in the fiscal analysis as a result of reduced risk relative to industry conditions and a lower interest rate environment 
we believe the assumptions used in the impairment analysis each year are reflective of the risks inherent in the business models of our reporting units and within our industry 
for fiscal  and none of the reporting units incurred operating losses which would impact our financial position in a material manner 
current operating results  including any losses  are evaluated by us in the assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the estimates and assumptions used in assessing the fair value of the reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties 
changes in judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill or intangible assets at additional reporting units 
additionally  adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units 
we can provide no assurances that  if such conditions occur  they will not trigger impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
as a result of the fiscal annual impairment analysis  we concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit 
however  the utiliquest reporting unit  having a goodwill balance of approximately million and an indefinite lived trade name of million  has recently been at lower operating levels as compared to historical levels 
the estimated fair value of the utiliquest reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  but the margin of excess has declined to less than 
the utiliquest reporting unit provides services to a broad range of customers including utilities and telecommunication providers 
these services are required prior to underground excavation and are influenced by overall economic activity  including construction activity 
the goodwill balance of this reporting unit may have an increased likelihood of impairment if a downturn in customer demand were to occur  or if the reporting unit were not able to execute against customer opportunities  and the long term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted 
furthermore  changes in the long term outlook may result in changes to other valuation assumptions 
if the discount rate applied in the fiscal impairment analysis had been basis points higher than estimated for each reporting unit and all other assumptions were held constant  the conclusion would remain unchanged and there would be no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite lived intangible intangible asset 
as of july   we believe the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units  however  there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be impaired in future periods 
certain of our reporting units also have other intangible assets including customer relationships  trade names  and non compete intangibles 
as of july   we believe that the carrying amounts of these intangible assets are recoverable 
however  if adverse events were to occur or circumstances were to change indicating that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable  the assets would be reviewed for impairment and the assets could be impaired 

table of contents accrued insurance claims 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our underground facility locating services 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined with the assistance of an actuary and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued insurance claims 
the liability for accrued claims and related accrued processing costs was million and million at july  and july   respectively 
based on payment patterns of similar prior claims  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  to be paid within the next twelve months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they will not be paid until sometime in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
with regard to losses occurring in fiscal and fiscal  we have retained the risk of loss of up to million on a per occurrence basis for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation 
these retention amounts are applicable to all of the states in which we operate  except with respect to workers compensation insurance in two states in which we participate in a state sponsored insurance fund 
aggregate stop loss coverage for automobile liability  general liability and workers compensation claims is million for fiscal and million for fiscal for losses under our employee health plan  we are party to a stop loss agreement under which we retain the risk of loss  on an annual basis  of the first  of claims per participant 
in addition  we retain the risk of loss for the first  of claim amounts that aggregate across all participants that exceed  income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
asc topic  income taxes asc topic prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
the first step evaluates an income tax position in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step measures the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements for those income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  recognition and classification of interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
under asc topic  companies may recognize a previously unrecognized tax benefit if the tax position is effectively as opposed to ultimately settled through examination  negotiation or litigation 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
we have granted stock based awards under our long term incentive plan plan and the non employee directors equity plan directors plan and  together with the plan  the plans 
we also have several other plans  both expired and current  under which awards are outstanding but under which no further awards will be granted 
our policy is to issue new shares to satisfy equity awards under the plans 
the plans provide for the grants of stock options  time based restricted share units rsus  and performance based restricted share units performance rsus 
the total number of shares available for grant under the plans as of july  was  compensation expense for stock based awards is based on the fair value at the measurement date and is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions including expected volatility based on the historical price of our stock over the expected life of the option  the risk free rate of return based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option  the expected life based on the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding using historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination  and dividend yield based on our history and expectation of dividend payments 
stock options generally vest ratably over a four year period and are exercisable over a period of up to ten years 
the fair value of restricted share units is estimated on the date of grant and is generally equal to the closing stock price on that date 
rsus vest ratably over a period of four years and are settled in one share of our common stock on the vesting date 
performance rsu s vest over a three year period from the date of grant if certain performance goals are achieved 
the performance targets are based on our fiscal year operating earnings adjusted for certain amounts as a percentage of contract revenues and our fiscal year operating cash flow level 
additionally  the awards include three year performance goals having similar measures as the fiscal year targets which  if met  result in supplemental shares awarded 
for performance rsus  we evaluate compensation expense quarterly and recognize expense for performance based awards if we determine it is probable that the performance criteria for the awards will be met 
the total amount of stock based compensation expense ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that actually vest and fluctuates as a result of performance criteria  as well as the vesting period of all stock based awards 
accordingly  the amount of compensation expense recognized during any fiscal year may not be representative of future stock based compensation expense 
in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation  compensation costs for performance based awards are recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine probability of achieving the performance goals at each reporting period and recognize compensation costs based on the estimate of the shares that are expected to vest 

table of contents contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
asc topic  contingencies asc topic requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued  we evaluate  among other factors  the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with asc topic as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined 
results of operations the company uses a fiscal year ending on the last saturday in july

table of contents revenues from specialty construction services provided to telecommunications companies increased  or million  to  million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal businesses acquired during the second quarter of fiscal generated million of this increase 
revenue increased million for a significant telephone customer for services provided under existing contracts  including fiber to the cell site activity  and for services provided under new contracts which expanded our geographic service area 
for another significant telecommunications customer revenue increased million for services provided under new contracts entered into during fiscal which expanded our geographic service area 
additionally  we had incremental revenue of million for a telephone customer from services provided under existing contracts and for rural broadband initiatives

these obligations include interest payments required on our senior subordinated notes and borrowings  working capital requirements  and the normal replacement of equipment at our current level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  or to the extent we buy back our common stock or repurchase or call our senior subordinated notes  our capital requirements may increase 
changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy could adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets  in which case we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the credit agreement to provide short term funding 
management continually monitors the financial markets and assesses general economic conditions for any impact on our financial position 
if changes in financial markets or other areas of the economy adversely impact our ability to access capital markets  we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the existing committed credit facility to provide short term funding 
we believe that our cash investment policies are conservative and we expect that the current volatility in the capital markets will not have a material impact on our cash investments 
backlog 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long term requirements contracts 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally  our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate 
our backlog totaled billion and billion at july  and july   respectively 
we expect to complete of the july  backlog during fiscal seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
also  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
as a result  we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including our fiscal year which ends on the last saturday in july  and as a result  fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks while fiscal consisted of weeks  with its fourth quarter having weeks of operations  the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  including possible delays as a result of material procurement  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers and the timing of their budget approvals  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuations in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuations in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on payroll withholdings obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates on our cash and equivalents and our debt obligations 
we monitor the effects of market changes on interest rates and manage interest rate risks by investing in short term cash equivalents with market rates of interest and by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase to annual earnings of approximately million and million  respectively  if our cash and equivalents held as of july  and july  were to be fully invested in interest bearing financial instruments 
our revolving credit facility permits borrowings at a variable rate of interest 
we had no outstanding borrowings as of july  outstanding long term debt at july  included million of our senior subordinated notes due in  which bear a fixed rate of interest of 
due to the fixed rate of interest on the notes  changes in interest rates would not have an impact on the related interest expense 
the fair value of the outstanding notes totaled approximately million as of july   based on quoted market prices 
there exists market risk sensitivity on the fair value of the fixed rate notes with respect to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point change in the market interest rates in effect would result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the notes of approximately million  calculated on a discounted cash flow basis 
we also have market risk for foreign currency exchange rates related to our operations in canada 
as of july   the market risk for foreign currency exchange rates was not significant as our operations in canada have not been material
