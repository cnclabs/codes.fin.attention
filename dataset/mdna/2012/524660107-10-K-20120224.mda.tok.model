risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec 
we have exposure to economic and other factors that affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
market demand for the majority of our products is most heavily influenced by consumer confidence 
to a lesser extent  market demand is impacted by other broad economic factors  including disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
all of these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and drive demand for our products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand weakness in our markets can lead to lower unit orders  sales and earnings in our businesses 
several factors  including a weak global economy  a depressed housing market  or low consumer confidence could contribute to conservative spending habits by consumers around the world 
short lead times in most of our markets allow for limited visibility into demand trends 
in  stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets 
many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness 
if economic and market conditions deteriorate  we may experience material negative impacts on our business  financial condition  operating cash flows and results of operations 
deteriorating financial condition of our customers could negatively affect our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
we serve customers in a variety of industries  some of which have and are continuing to experience low levels of demand due to a weak global economy 
a sustained economic downturn increases the possibility that one or more of our significant customers  or a group of less significant customers  could become insolvent  which could adversely impact our sales  net earnings  financial condition  cash flow and liquidity 
costs of raw materials could negatively affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  therefore  our raw material costs move with the market 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can negatively impact our earnings 
conversely  if raw material costs decrease  we generally pass through reduced selling prices to our customers 
reduced selling prices tied to higher cost inventory reduces our segment margins and earnings 

table of contents part i steel is our most significant raw material 
the global steel markets are cyclical in nature and have been volatile in recent years 
this volatility can result in large swings in pricing and margins from year to year 
our operations can also be impacted by changes in the cost of fabrics and foam scrap 
we experienced significant fluctuations in the cost of these commodities in recent years 
higher raw material costs in recent years led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this primarily impacted our residential furnishings and industrial materials product mix and decreased profit margins 
this trend could further negatively impact our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet depending upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
our ability to realize deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is dependent upon the amount and source of future taxable income 
economic uncertainty or tax law changes could change our underlying assumptions on which valuation reserves are established and negatively affect future period earnings and balance sheets 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
we believe that most companies in our lines of business compete primarily on price  but  depending upon the particular product  we experience competition based on quality  performance and availability as well 
we face ongoing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from asia and europe 
in addition to lower labor rates  foreign competitors benefit at times from lower raw material costs 
they may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could be harmed by foreign competitors 
premium non innerspring mattresses those that have either a foam or air core have experienced rapid growth in the us bedding market in recent years 
while still a relatively small portion of the total market in units approximately  these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars approximately due to their higher average selling prices 
if sales of foam or air core mattresses continue to grow appreciably  it could reduce our market share in the us bedding market  and negatively impact our sales and earnings 
our goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to potential impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long lived assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or approximately of our total assets 
in addition  net property  plant and equipment and sundry assets totaled approximately million  or approximately of total assets 

table of contents part i we review our ten reporting units for potential goodwill impairment in june as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing  and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists 
in addition  we test for the recoverability of long lived assets at year end  and more often if an event or circumstance indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
the annual goodwill impairment review performed in june indicated no goodwill impairments  but fair market value for one of our ten reporting units fixture display only exceeded book value by approximately 
the fair market values of all other reporting units exceeded book value by more than 
the goodwill associated with the fixture display reporting unit was million at december  the unit is dependent upon capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores 
retailer activity was moderately lower in  and the unit did not meet expectations 
if actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels  future goodwill impairments could be possible 
in december  management approved a restructuring plan which primarily related to the closure of four underperforming plants 
this resulted in long lived asset impairment of million 
prior to that event  our last material asset impairment occurred in if actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and long lived asset calculations  we could incur impairment charges  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales were generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries may have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results 
technology failures or cyber security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we rely on information systems to obtain  process  analyze and manage data  as well as to facilitate the manufacture and distribution of inventory to and from our facilities 
we receive  process and ship orders  manage the billing of  and collections from  our customers  and manage the accounting for  and payment to  our vendors 
security breaches of this infrastructure can create system disruptions or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
if this occurs  our operations could be disrupted  or we may suffer financial loss because of lost or misappropriated information 
we cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities or new discoveries in the field of cryptography will not compromise our technology protecting information systems 
if these systems are interrupted or damaged by these events or fail for any extended period of time  then our results of operations could be adversely affected

table of contents part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
highlights demand improved in certain of our markets during  with automotive and office furniture leading the way 
in contrast  stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets 
many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness 
sales growth in was driven primarily by factors that bring little incremental earnings 
the main revenue catalyst was raw material related price inflation  but currency and a change in sales at our steel mill from intra segment to trade also contributed to the year over year increase 
across the remainder of the company as a whole  unit volume was up slightly 
earnings decreased in  largely due to restructuring related charges associated with the decision to close manufacturing facilities in certain businesses facing persistently weak market demand 
with concerns about weak markets  we continued to closely monitor working capital levels  and ended the year with working capital as a percent of annualized sales well below our target 
operating cash for the full year once again exceeded the amount required to fund capital expenditures and dividends 
in august  we raised the quarterly dividend to 
per share and extended to years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases at a compound annual growth rate 
we also repurchased million shares of our stock during our financial profile remains strong 
we ended with net debt to net capital below our long term targeted range and over million available under our existing commercial paper program and revolver facility 
the revolving credit agreement was renewed in  with a five year term ending in late in the year  we announced our plan to purchase western pneumatic tube  a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems 
this acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure  leading positions in growing  profitable  attractive markets 
we completed the acquisition in early we assess our overall performance by comparing our total shareholder return tsr  on a rolling three year basis  to that of peer companies 
we target tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term 
for the three years ended december   we generated tsr of per year on average 
that places us in the top of the s p  just shy of our top one third goal 
these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 

table of contents part ii introduction total shareholder return total shareholder return tsr  relative to peer companies  is the key financial measure that we use to assess long term performance 
tsr is driven by the change in our share price and the dividends we pay 
tsr change in stock price dividends beginning stock price 
we seek to achieve tsr in the top one third of the s p over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four tsr sources revenue growth  margin expansion  dividends  and share repurchases 
we monitor our tsr performance relative to the s p on a rolling three year basis 
for the three year measurement period that ended december   we generated tsr of per year on average  while the s p index generated average tsr of per year 
that places us in the top of the s p  just shy of our top one third goal 
our incentive programs reward return generation 
senior executives participate in a tsr based incentive program based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately peers 
business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit s direct control 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with our largest customer representing less than of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture and bedding  a variety of other manufacturers  and many major retailers 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand  raw material cost trends  and competition 
market demand market demand including product mix is impacted by several economic factors  with consumer confidence being most significant 
other important factors include disposable income levels  employment levels  housing turnover  and interest rates 
all these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
demand improved in certain of our markets during  with automotive and office furniture leading the way 
in contrast  stagnant demand negatively impacted our major residential markets 
many consumers continued to postpone spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of ongoing economic weakness 

table of contents part ii it is our belief that the us economy will face headwinds for longer than we previously expected 
we are no longer willing to wait for an economic recovery to bolster earnings  and as a result  we have taken further steps to improve ongoing profitability 
we have closed some production facilities and reduced overhead costs 
while these activities improve our cost structure  capacity utilization levels in the majority of our operations remain low 
our current productive capacity should readily accommodate sales of over billion assuming current sales mix 
until our spare capacity is fully utilized  each additional million of sales from incremental unit volume is expected to generate approximately million to million of additional pre tax earnings 
raw material costs in many of our businesses  we enjoy a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors generally do not have 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities fluctuate 
we typically have short term commitments from our suppliers  accordingly  our raw material costs generally move with the market 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is crucial 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we typically implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
conversely  when costs decrease significantly  we generally pass those lower costs through to our customers 
the timing of our price increases or decreases is important  we typically experience a lag in recovering higher costs  so we also expect to realize a lag as costs decline 
steel is our principal raw material and at various times in past years we have experienced extreme cost fluctuations in this commodity 
in most cases  the major changes both increases and decreases were passed through to customers with selling price adjustments 
in late and early  steel costs increased  and we raised our selling prices to recover the majority of the higher costs 
by the end of  we were facing further inflation in steel costs  and we implemented additional price increases in early by mid year  market prices for certain types of steel had begun to decrease 
the margin pressure we experienced in the last half of resulted in part from lowering our selling prices selectively in advance of our average cost of steel declining  in order to maintain market share and minimize deterioration in product mix 
as a producer of steel rod  we are also impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
scrap costs increased in  and while market prices for steel rod also increased  those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs 
as a result  metal margins within the steel industry and in our rod producing operation were lower during scrap costs increased further in early but market prices for steel rod also increased 
metal margins for the full year were slightly improved 
our other raw materials include woven and non woven fabrics  foam scrap  and chemicals 
we have experienced changes in the cost of these materials in recent years  and in most years  have been able to pass them through to our customers 
in late these costs began increasing  and in early  we implemented price increases to recover the majority of the higher costs 

table of contents part ii when we raise our prices to recover higher raw material costs  this sometimes causes customers to modify their product designs and replace higher cost components with lower cost components 
we experienced this de contenting effect in our residential furnishings segment in the last half of however selective selling price reductions helped contain this activity 
as our customers changed the quantity and mix of components in their finished goods to address commodity inflation  our profit margins were negatively impacted 
we must continue to find ways to assist our customers in improving the functionality and reducing the cost of their products  while providing higher margin and profit contribution for our operations 
competition many of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line 
in general  our competitors tend to be smaller  private companies 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering better product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore 
in addition to lower labor rates  foreign competitors benefit at times from lower raw material costs 
they may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates 
we typically remain price competitive  even versus many foreign manufacturers  as a result of our highly efficient operations  low labor content  vertical integration in steel and wire  and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities 
however  we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices  and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs 
we experienced a temporary loss of market share during the last half of as certain of our bedding customers purchased a portion of their innerspring requirements from european suppliers 
the opportunity to buy these components at a lower price resulted from a combination of factors i the weaker euro  ii temporarily lower wire costs  and iii greater excess capacity as a result of economic turmoil in europe 
by the end of  we had regained the majority of the lost volume 
the margin pressure we experienced in the last half of resulted in part from price competition in other of our businesses as we reduced prices selectively to maintain market share in light of depressed industry volume 
premium non innerspring mattresses those that have either a foam or air core have experienced rapid growth in the us bedding market in recent years 
while still a relatively small portion of the total market in units approximately  these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars approximately due to their higher average selling prices 
we expect these products to continue to grow 
some of our traditional bedding customers are beginning to offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel 
these hybrid products allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring 
in late  we filed an antidumping suit related to innerspring imports from china  south africa and vietnam 
we saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during after 
table of contents part ii the antidumping investigations began 
as a result  we regained market share and performance in our bedding group improved 
the investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early the current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant  ranging from to  and should remain in effect at least until early imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices  however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin 
leggett  along with several us manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping countervailing duty orders  formed a coalition and are working with members of congress  the us department of commerce  and us customs and border protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and or countervailing duty orders 
restructuring plan in december  we approved a restructuring plan to reduce our overhead costs and improve ongoing profitability 
the activities primarily entailed the closure of four underperforming facilities 
we incurred a million pre tax largely non cash charge in the th quarter of primarily related to this plan  which included million of long lived asset impairments and million of other restructuring related costs 
we expect an additional million of restructuring costs in  with these plant closures complete by mid year 
earnings should benefit in from the cost savings associated with the restructuring plan and other restructuring activity initiated in the latter part of our forecast anticipates an approximate million pre tax earnings benefit 
per share from these activities 
discontinued operations and divestitures we divested seven businesses as a part of the strategic realignment we announced in late the bulk of this activity five of the seven divestitures was complete by the end of in  we sold the coated fabrics business unit  and in we divested the storage products business unit 
results of operations for these businesses are classified as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
for more information about discontinued operations and the divestitures  see note b to the consolidated financial statements on page

residential furnishings residential furnishings sales increased in  primarily from inflation and currency  which generated little profit 
unit volume in the segment was flat 
demand in most of our residential markets continued to be soft as consumers postponed spending on larger ticket items such as bedding and furniture in the face of an ongoing weak economy 
full year unit volumes were essentially flat in our us spring business but declined in international spring and furniture hardware from pronounced market weakness mid year 
the only business in the segment that posted meaningful unit growth was our adjustable bed business  where unit volumes grew for the full year 

table of contents part ii ebit and ebit margins decreased versus  primarily due to higher restructuring related costs of million  less favorable sales mix  inflation  and other operating cost increases 
we initiated restructuring activities in the last half of in an effort to improve ongoing profitability  and part of that activity occurred in residential furnishings 
we consolidated four operations in the segment  including two carpet underlay plants  a canadian spring facility  and a fabric coating business 
we expect segment margins to benefit in from the cost savings associated with these activities 
commercial fixturing components sales decreased in  largely from lower demand in our store fixtures business  as some of the large  value oriented retailers significantly curtailed both new store construction and remodeling activity during the year 
in contrast  market demand continued to improve in office furniture components as that business posted strong growth for the full year 
ebit and ebit margins also decreased versus the prior year  primarily due to lower sales 
our efforts to improve ongoing profitability resulted in the decision late in to consolidate one of our six remaining store fixture locations 
the majority of the sales from this operation will be supplied through two of our remaining facilities 
in addition  consistent with our stated plan to continually assess our portfolio and exit non core businesses  we divested our small  uk based point of purchase display operation in january industrial materials sales increased  reflecting steel related price inflation and higher trade sales from our steel mill  both of which generated little incremental profit 
full year unit volumes declined in both wire drawing and steel tubing  reflecting weak bedding  furniture  and store fixtures end markets 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus  mainly from higher restructuring related costs of million 
ebit margins also decreased during the year as a result of a change in sales from intra segment to trade at our steel rod mill 
these trade sales have positive earnings contribution in addition to covering overhead costs  and have kept the mill running at full capacity while internal demand for steel rod has been down 
however  this sales shift is dilutive to margins since it increases our reported sales while preserving comparable ebit levels 
restructuring activities in late involved the closure of two facilities in the segment 
we closed one of our six domestic wire drawing operations and consolidated that volume into two of the remaining plants 
we also announced the closing of a wire forming operation that was a supplier of coated wire dishwasher racks into the domestic appliance industry 
these activities should improve capacity utilization within the segment in and benefit future earnings and margins 

table of contents part ii specialized products in specialized products  sales increased in  primarily reflecting improved demand across the major businesses in the segment 
changes in currency exchange rates also added to year over year sales growth 
automotive growth continues to be driven by the recovery in global industry production levels 
ebit increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales partially offset by higher restructuring related costs of million  raw material cost inflation  and currency impacts

consolidated results the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings during  and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes 
dollar amounts in millions  except per share data amount net sales year ended december  acquisition sales growth small divestitures internal sales increase approximate inflation approximate unit volume increase internal sales increase year ended december  net earnings attributable to leggett platt dollar amounts  net of tax year ended december  non recurrence of divestiture note write down non recurrence of bad debt expense associated with a customer bankruptcy non recurrence of unusual tax items benefit associated with the sale of a building lower effective tax rate other factors  including higher unit volume offset by lower metal margins year ended december  earnings per share earnings per share in  sales increased versus demand improved in many of our end markets during the year 
the automotive and office furniture markets experienced significant improvement from very depressed demand levels in retail fixturing demand was also reasonably strong 
our residential bedding and furniture markets started strong but weakened in the last half of the year as consumer spending on larger ticket items slowed 
full year earnings increased in  primarily reflecting higher unit volumes  a lower effective tax rate  and the non recurrence of three significant expense items from 
table of contents part ii detailed in the table above 
these earnings improvements were partially offset by lower metal margins 
as a producer of steel rod  we are impacted by volatility in metal margins the difference in the cost of steel scrap and the market price for steel rod 
scrap costs increased in  and while market prices for steel rod also increased  those increases did not keep pace with escalating scrap costs 
as a result  metal margins within the steel industry and in our rod producing operation were lower during lifo impact all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in our consolidated financials  an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie outside the segments to convert about of our inventories to the last in  first out lifo method 
these are primarily our domestic  steel related inventories 
we experienced a large swing in the lifo impact in recent years 
in  significant steel cost decreases resulted in a lifo benefit of million 
in  moderate inflation led to full year lifo expense of million 
the lifo impact recognized at the corporate level is generally offset each year by fifo impacts at the segment level 
segment level earnings in were significantly burdened primarily in the first half of the year as we consumed higher cost steel while selling prices decreased 
in  segment level earnings benefitted under the fifo method from the effect of rising commodity costs 
for further discussion of inventories  see note a to the consolidated financial statements on page interest and income taxes net interest expense in was roughly flat with the consolidated worldwide effective income tax rate for was lower  at  versus in in  the tax rate benefitted from the higher level of earnings  changes in the mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions  and tentative settlements of tax examinations 
during  we reached tentative agreement with the irs on their examination of certain tax credit claims  and recognized tax benefits of million associated with those claims 
these benefits were partially offset by incremental taxes resulting from the repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
during  we repatriated million of foreign earnings  which resulted in a net tax charge of million 
in  the higher tax rate reflected unfavorable tax adjustments resulting from mexican tax law changes  which caused us to re evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities in that jurisdiction 
as a result  we recorded a million tax charge to earnings related to and prior year losses that might expire before they could be utilized to reduce taxable earnings 

table of contents part ii segment results in the following section we discuss sales and ebit for each of our segments 
we provide additional detail about segment results and a reconciliation of segment ebit to consolidated ebit in note f to the consolidated financial statements on page dollar amounts in millions change in sales change same location sales sales residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products total intersegment sales elimination external sales change in ebit ebit margins ebit residential furnishings commercial fixturing components industrial materials specialized products intersegment eliminations other change in lifo reserve total this is the change in sales not attributable to acquisitions or divestitures 
these are sales that come from the same plants and facilities that we owned one year earlier 
segment margins are calculated on total sales 
overall company margin is calculated on external sales 
residential furnishings residential furnishings sales increased in  primarily due to market share gains in our furniture components business 
demand in most of our residential markets was relatively strong during the first half of the year but weakened noticeably in the last half as consumer demand for large ticket items such as mattress sets and upholstered furniture slowed 
ebit and ebit margins increased versus  with the earnings impact from higher unit volumes augmented by pricing discipline  significantly reduced bad debt expense  and a benefit associated with the sale of a building 

table of contents part ii commercial fixturing components sales increased in due to relatively strong demand in our store fixtures business by value oriented retailers  and improved market demand in office furniture components 
ebit and ebit margins also increased versus the prior year  largely due to higher sales 
industrial materials sales increased  reflecting steel related price inflation and improved market demand 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus  as higher sales were more than offset by lower metal margins within the steel industry 
specialized products sales increased in  reflecting improved demand across all the major businesses in the segment 
ebit and ebit margins increased versus the prior year with the impact of higher sales bolstered by cost reductions 
results from discontinued operations full year earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million  from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this earnings increase was primarily due to the non recurrence of million net of tax of environmental charges related to an aluminum property and lower long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges associated with the divestitures which were complete by late 
table of contents part ii liquidity and capitalization in this section  we provide details  reflecting both continuing and discontinued operations  about our uses of cash cash from operations working capital trends debt position and total capitalization we use cash for the following finance capital requirements eg productivity  growth and acquisitions pay dividends repurchase our stock our operations provide most of the cash we require  but debt may also be used to fund a portion of our needs 
for more than years  our operations have provided more than sufficient cash to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments 
in  we generated the second highest level of cash from operations in our history  at million  which included a significant reduction in working capital as sales contracted 
with a slight increase in working capital in due to sales growth  operating cash was million 
in  cash flow from operations decreased to million  but still readily exceeded our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends 
we expect cash flow from operations to again exceed million 
we ended with net debt to net capital of  below the conservative end of our long term targeted range of 
page presents a table of the calculation of net debt as a percent of net capital at the end of the past two years 
uses of cash finance capital requirements improving returns of the existing asset base will continue to be a key focus 
however  cash is available to fund selective growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions 
logo logo 
table of contents part ii capital expenditures include investments we make to maintain  modernize  and expand manufacturing capacity 
the chart above shows that capital expenditures have been relatively stable in recent years  although well below levels of the previous decade 
we expect capital expenditures to approximate million in in all of our businesses  we continue to invest in the maintenance of facilities and equipment 
however  with excess productive capacity across our operations from continued low demand levels  we have reduced spending on expansion projects 
the anticipated increase in relates primarily to specific new automotive programs that we have been awarded  and that should contribute to earnings and cash flow beginning in in  we began assigning each business unit a specific role eg grow  core  fix  divest within our portfolio of businesses 
this changed our long term priorities for allocating capital and reduced capital spending levels 
we actively pursue disciplined growth within our grow business units and earmark expansion capital for these opportunities 
operations designated as core business units receive capital primarily for productivity enhancements 
our strategic  long term  annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions 
we are seeking acquisitions within our growth businesses  and are looking for opportunities to enter new  higher growth markets carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage 
during the past few years  acquisitions were a lower priority as we primarily focused on completing the divestitures and improving margins and returns of our existing businesses 
as a result  no significant acquisitions were completed in   and we recently turned our focus onto acquisitions and have begun actively soliciting opportunities while maintaining our screening discipline 
on december   we announced our plan to purchase  for million  western pneumatic tube  a leading provider to the aerospace industry of integral components for critical aircraft systems 
with sales of million  these operations will constitute a new  stand alone business unit within our industrial materials segment 
this acquisition aligns extremely well with our strategy to seek businesses with secure  leading positions in growing  profitable  attractive markets and that make sense to be a part of leggett platt 
we completed the acquisition on january  additional details about acquisitions can be found in note r to the consolidated financial statements on page 
table of contents part ii pay dividends logo we expect to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
in we modestly increased the quarterly dividend  to 
per share  and extended to years our record of consecutive annual dividend increases  at an average compound growth rate of 
our targeted dividend payout is approximately of net earnings  but actual payout has been higher recently and will likely remain above targeted levels in the near term 
maintaining and increasing the dividend remains a high priority 
we anticipate spending approximately million on dividends in cash from operations has been  and is expected to continue to be  more than sufficient to readily fund both capital expenditures and dividends 

table of contents part ii repurchase stock logo during the past three years  we repurchased a total of million shares of our stock and issued million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans  reducing outstanding shares by 
in  we repurchased million shares at an average per share price of 
during the year  we issued million shares through employee benefit plans including shares that were purchased by employees in lieu of cash compensation 
for the past few years  we have made few acquisitions  instead  we used excess cash including divestiture proceeds largely to repurchase shares 
with the acquisition of western pneumatic tube  the amount of stock repurchased during will likely be significantly lower 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board to repurchase up to million shares in 
table of contents part ii cash from operations cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
earnings and changes in working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
as shown in the chart below and discussed in the paragraph that follows  most of the variability in cash from operations in recent years has come from changes in working capital 
logo in  cash from operations decreased primarily due to lower earnings 
the decrease in operating cash versus was due to the change in working capital levels as shown in the chart above 
cash from operations in benefitted from a million reduction in working capital that occurred as a result of the economy induced sales contraction 
the following table presents key working capital measures at the end of the past two years 
amount in millions days outstanding change change accounts receivable  net inventory  net accounts payable the accounts receivable ratio represents the days of sales outstanding calculated as ending net accounts receivable net sales number of days in the year 
the inventory ratio represents days of inventory on hand calculated as ending net inventory cost of goods sold number of days in the year 
the accounts payable ratio represents the days of payables outstanding calculated as ending accounts payable cost of goods sold number of days in the year 

table of contents part ii accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso the dollar amount of accounts receivable increased from year end levels  primarily due to inflation driven sales increases 
we continue to focus on collection efforts to ensure customer accounts are paid on time 
as part of our accounts receivable review process  we evaluate individual customers payment histories  financial health  industry prospects  and current macroeconomic events in determining if outstanding amounts are collectible 
in  we incurred million of bad debt expense as compared to million in changes in the dso reflected in the table above are consistent with our historical range  and are not indicative of changes in payment trends or credit worthiness of customers 
instead  dso fluctuates from year to year with normal differences in the timing of sales and cash receipts 
inventory and days inventory on hand dio although the unit volume of our inventories was down from year end levels  the dollar value of inventories increased slightly due to inflation in raw material costs 
during  we recognized expense of million associated with obsolete and slow moving inventories  in this expense totaled million 
we do not expect significant changes in customer or industry trends that would materially increase the exposure to inventory obsolescence 
our dio typically fluctuates within a reasonably narrow range as a result of differences in the timing of sales  production levels  and inventory purchases 
our dio decreased compared to the prior year due to lower unit volumes of inventory 
this improvement reflects a continued focus on optimizing returns and a reduction of inventory in response to persistent demand weakness in certain markets 
accounts payable and days payable outstanding dpo the dollar value of accounts payable increased in primarily due to inflation in raw material costs 
we actively strive to optimize payment terms with our vendors  and over the last few years  have increased our dpo by approximately ten days 
changes in the dpo reflected in the table above are the result of normal fluctuation in our operating activity 
working capital levels vary by segment 
the commercial fixturing components segment typically has relatively higher accounts receivable balances due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the fixture display group 
this business group also generally requires higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of its products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 

table of contents part ii capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x these calculations include current maturities  but exclude commercial paper to reflect the averages of outstanding debt with scheduled maturities 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  plus implied interest included in operating leases 
earnings consist principally of income from continuing operations before income taxes  plus fixed charges 
the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and  calculated in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 

table of contents part ii we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows a more meaningful comparison to periods during which cash fluctuates significantly 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities increased million in during the year  we increased our commercial paper borrowings by million 
in anticipation of long term debt maturing in april  we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps in the swap contracts manage benchmark interest rate risk associated with million of potential future debt issuance  and mature in august the swaps have a weighted average interest rate of 
they do not hedge the credit spread over treasuries  our credit worthiness  or the market price of credit related to any future debt issuances 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note s to the consolidated financial statements on page short term borrowings we can raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders 
this agreement was renewed in  with a five year term ending in the credit agreement allows us to issue letters of credit up to million 
when we issue letters of credit in this manner  our capacity under the agreement  and consequently  our ability to issue commercial paper  is reduced by a corresponding amount 
amounts outstanding related to our commercial paper program were dollar amounts in millions total program authorized commercial paper outstanding classified as long term debt letters of credit issued under the credit agreement total program usage total program available 
table of contents part ii the average and maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during was million and million  respectively 
during the fourth quarter  the average and maximum amounts outstanding were million and million respectively 
commercial paper amounts fluctuated during the year due to normal changes in working capital funding requirements 
at year end  we had no letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement  but we had million of stand by letters of credit outside the agreement to take advantage of more attractive fee pricing 
on january   we increased the amount of commercial paper outstanding to million 
these proceeds were used primarily to finance the acquisition of western pneumatic tube cash purchase price of million  but also for ordinary working capital needs and other general purposes 
with anticipated operating cash flows  our commercial paper program  and our expected ability to issue debt in the capital markets  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations  pay dividends  fund future growth  repurchase stock  and repay maturing debt 
accessibility of cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million primarily invested in interest bearing bank accounts and in bank time deposits with original maturities of three months or less 
a substantial portion of these funds are held in the international accounts of our foreign operations 
though we do not rely on this foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs  we believe we could bring most of this cash back to the us over a period of two to three years without material cost 
however  if we had to bring all the foreign cash back immediately  we could incur incremental taxes of up to million 
in  we brought back million of foreign cash at an incremental tax cost of million 
in  we brought back an additional million through payments on intercompany loans at no added tax cost 

table of contents part ii contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual cash obligations and commitments at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations including acquisitions  pensions  and reserves for tax contingencies total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 

table of contents part ii critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and disclosures 
if we used different estimates or judgments our financial statements would change  and some of those changes could be significant 
our estimates are frequently based upon historical experience and are considered by management  at the time they are made  to be reasonable and appropriate 
estimates are adjusted for actual events  as they occur 
critical accounting estimates are those that are a subject to uncertainty and change  and b of material impact to our financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and judgments which we believe could have the most significant effect on our financial statements 
we provide additional details regarding our significant accounting policies in note a to the consolidated financial statements on page description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of june and as triggering events occur 
in the past three years  no impairments have been recorded as a result of the annual impairment reviews 
in order to assess goodwill for potential impairment  judgment is required to estimate the fair market value of each reporting unit which is one level below reportable segments using the combination of a discounted cash flow model and market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit 
the cash flow model contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance 
margins  sales levels  and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model 
fair market values for one of the reporting units fixture display exceeded book value by approximately 
the goodwill associated with this reporting unit is million  and is dependent on capital spending by retailers on both new stores and remodeling of existing stores 
retailer activity was moderately lower in the fixture display reporting unit did not meet expectations for  but is expected to recover to forecasted earnings levels over the next two years 
if actual performance does not improve and remains at current levels  future goodwill impairments could be possible 
the remaining reporting units have fair market values that exceed carrying value by more than  and have goodwill of million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill cont 
the market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio 
ratios are derived from comparable publicly traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry as the reporting unit 
information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in note c on page other long lived assets other long lived assets are tested for recoverability at year end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for other long lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured usually at a branch level 
impairments of other long lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place  or we decide to discontinue product lines completely 
our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets 
for assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value  fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets 
these impairments are unpredictable 
impairments were million in  million in  and million in the impairments were largely the result of lowered future business expectations at several underperforming locations that resulted in the decision to exit some unprofitable lines of business 
prior forecasts assumed a recovery in business levels primarily housing related industries that did not materialize 
we have several operations that are dependent on the housing and retail industries that could also experience future impairments if these operations cash flows do not improve from current levels 
inventory reserves we reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow moving ie not selling very quickly 
at december   the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was million approximately of fifo inventories 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions inventory reserves cont 
if we have had no sales of a given product for months  those items are generally deemed to have no value and are written down completely 
if we have more than a one year s supply of a product  we value that inventory at net realizable value what we think we will recover 
changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to quickly become obsolete or slow moving 
the calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow moving based upon historical experience on average 
additions to inventory reserves in were million  which was comparable to the previous year 
these additions in were incurred generally among all segments and considered to be a normal level of obsolescence 
we incurred write downs of million related to the restructuring plan 
workers compensation we are substantially self insured for costs related to workers compensation  and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation 
our estimates of self insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay since we are self insured 
we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers 
over the past five years  we have incurred  on average  million annually for costs associated with workers compensation 
average year to year variation over the past five years has been approximately million 
at december   we had accrued million to cover future self insurance liabilities 
internal safety statistics and cost trends have improved in the last several years 
we expect worker compensation costs to remain at current lower levels for the foreseeable future 
credit losses for accounts and notes receivable  we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible 
when we become aware of a specific customer s potential inability to pay  we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible 
our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical loss experience 
a significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates 
the average annual amount of customer related credit losses was million less than of annual net sales over the last three years 
at december   our reserves for doubtful accounts totaled million about of our accounts and customer related notes receivable of million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions credit losses cont 
our customers are diverse and many are small to medium sized companies  with some being highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning 
in and  bad debt expense averaged million  which is a return to more normal levels compared to we did not experience any significant individual customer bankruptcies during the past two years 
we believe the financial health of our major customers is stable  but some are highly leveraged  and this could cause circumstances to change in the future 
we recognized an million loss in related to the aluminum divestiture note 
at december   we had million of non customer notes outstanding  primarily related to divested businesses  and have recorded reserves of million for these notes 
most of these notes are held by highly leveraged entities  which could result in the need for additional reserves in the future 
pension accounting for our pension plans  we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of those benefit obligations 
the pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefits paid  which also impacts current year pension expense 
determination of pension expense requires an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held bonds and equities 
the discount rates used to calculate the pension liability and pension expense for our most significant plans decreased approximately basis points in due to lower corporate bond yields 
each basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by 
million and increases the plans benefit obligation by million 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension accounting cont 
other assumptions include rates of compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates  and retirement ages 
these estimates impact the pension expense or income we recognize and our reported benefit obligations 
the expected return on assets in decreased to  compared to in and in a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by 
million  but have no effect on the plans funded status 
assuming a long term investment horizon  we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions  even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time 
these estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements 
subsequent to year end  we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns 
tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions  including among other things the timing and amounts of deductions  and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain 
our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions 
our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws  the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction  and the results of current tax audits and assessments 
potential changes in tax laws could impact assumptions related to the non repatriation of certain foreign earnings 
if all non repatriated earnings were taxed  we would incur additional taxes of approximately million 
tax audits by various taxing authorities are expected to increase as governments continue to look for ways to raise additional revenue 
based upon past experience  we do not expect any major changes to our tax liability as a result of this increased audit activity  however  we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience 

table of contents part ii description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes cont 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount  source  and timing of future taxable income 
valuation allowances are established against future potential tax benefits to reflect the amounts we believe have no more than a probability of being realized 
in addition  assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of possible repatriation 
the recovery of net operating losses nol s has been closely evaluated for the likelihood of recovery based upon factors such as the age of losses  viable tax planning strategies  and future taxable earnings expectations 
we believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary 
however  if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required  we could incur additional tax expense 
contingencies we evaluate various legal  environmental  and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate 
if it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred  we accrue a liability for the reasonable estimate of the ultimate loss 
our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
we have several environmental clean up activities related to current and closed facilities that mostly involve soil and groundwater contamination 
based upon facts available at this time  we believe reserves are adequate  however cost estimates could change as we determine more about the severity and cost of remediation 
legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in note t on page over the past five years  the largest annual cost for litigation claims was million excluding legal fees 
historically  actual settlements have been reasonably close to original loss estimates 

table of contents part ii contingencies our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies ie  losses that may or may not occur are based on our assessment of the likelihood that the expenses will actually occur  and our estimate of the likely cost 
our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
npi lawsuit on january   national products  inc npi sued gamber johnson  llc gamber  our wholly owned subsidiary  in case c c jlr  in the united states district court  western district of washington  alleging that portions of a gamber marketing video contained false and misleading statements 
npi and gamber compete in the market for vehicle computer mounting systems 
npi sought a injunctive relief requiring gamber to stop using the video and to notify customers  b damages for its alleged lost profits  and c disgorgement of gamber s profits in an unspecified amount 
although part of the claims were dismissed by the court before and during trial  a jury  on april   found four statements in the video were false and deliberate and awarded million in disgorgement damages against gamber 
on august   the court a reduced the jury verdict to approximately million  b granted npi attorney fees and costs in an amount to be determined  and c granted an injunction requiring gamber to notify its distributors and resellers of the verdict 
the court subsequently awarded npi million in attorney fees and costs 
on september   npi filed an appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
gamber also filed an appeal 
on september   a three judge panel of the court of appeals affirmed the trial court s decision 
each party filed a request for rehearing en banc a rehearing by the full court  which was denied on october  on november   our insurance carrier paid the judgment and attorney fee awards in full roughly million

the suit was substantially similar to a prior suit filed by the same plaintiff  in the same court  on february  suit 
the suit was dismissed without prejudice based on the plaintiff s failure to make demand on our board and shareholders 
as before  the plaintiff did not make such demand 
on april   the suit was dismissed without prejudice 
on may   the plaintiff filed an appeal to the missouri court of appeals 
the briefing process began january we do not expect a ruling from the court of appeals for several months 
the suit was purportedly brought on our behalf  naming us as a nominal defendant  and certain current and former officers and directors as individual defendants including david s 
haffner  karl g 
glassman  matthew c

table of contents part ii the plaintiff alleged  among other things  that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties  backdated and received backdated stock options violating our stock plans  caused or allowed us to issue false and misleading financial statements and proxy statements  sold our stock while possessing material non public information  committed gross mismanagement  wasted corporate assets  committed fraud  violated the missouri securities act  and were unjustly enriched 
the plaintiff was seeking  among other things unspecified monetary damages against the individual defendants  certain equitable and other relief relating to the profits from the alleged improper conduct  the adoption of certain corporate governance proposals  the imposition of a constructive trust over the defendants stock options and proceeds  punitive damages  the rescission of certain unexercised options  and the reimbursement of litigation costs 
the plaintiff was not seeking monetary relief from us 
we have director and officer liability insurance in force subject to customary limits and exclusions 
we and the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss the suit in late october  asserting the plaintiff failed to make demand on our board and shareholders as required by missouri law  and  consistent with the court s ruling in the suit  this failure to make demand should not be excused  the plaintiff is not a representative shareholder  the suit was based on a statistical analysis of stock option grants and our stock prices that we believe was flawed  the plaintiff failed to state a substantive claim  the common law fraud claim was not pled with sufficient particularity  and the statute of limitations has expired on the fraud claim and all the alleged challenged grants except the december  grant 
as to this grant  the motions to dismiss advised the court that it was made under our deferred compensation program  which i provided that options would be dated on the last business day of december  and ii was filed with the sec on december  setting out the pricing mechanism well before the grant date 
we do not expect that the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating cash flows or results of operations
