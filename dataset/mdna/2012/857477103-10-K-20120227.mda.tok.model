discount accretion is more fully discussed in net interest revenue under consolidated results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis 
on a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest revenue declined  from billion in to billion 
these amounts reflect increases from tax equivalent adjustments of million and million  respectively 
both declines reported basis and fully taxable equivalent were primarily associated with the above described decline in discount accretion

in  we secured mandates for approximately trillion in assets to be serviced  of the total  trillion was installed prior to december   with the remaining billion expected to be installed in the new business not installed by december  was not included in assets under custody and administration at that date  and had no impact on servicing fee revenue for  as the assets are not included until their installation is complete and we begin to service them 
once installed  the assets generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods 
we will provide various services for these assets including accounting  fund administration  custody  foreign exchange  securities finance  transfer agency  performance analytics  compliance reporting and monitoring  hedge fund servicing  private equity administration  real estate administration  depository banking services  wealth management services and investment manager operations outsourcing 
consolidated results of operations this section discusses our consolidated results of operations for compared to  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under item a comparison of consolidated results of operations for with those for is provided under comparison of and in this management s discussion and analysis 
total revenue years ended december  change dollars in millions fee revenue servicing fees management fees trading services securities finance processing fees and other total fee revenue net interest revenue interest revenue interest expense net interest revenue gains losses related to investment securities  net total revenue our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by trading services  securities finance and processing fees and other revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from client deposits and short term investment activities by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet clients needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 
fee revenue servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately of our total fee revenue for and for the level of these fees is influenced by several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by clients  and are generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income security valuations 

table of contents generally  servicing fees are affected  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration  while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
additional factors  such as the level of transaction volumes  changes in service level  balance credits  client minimum balances  pricing concessions and other factors  may have a significant effect on our servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
management fees for enhanced index and actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products 
enhanced index and actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements 
performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements 
generally  we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
the following table presents selected equity market indices as of and for the years ended december  and daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity market valuations that affect our servicing and management fee revenue  respectively 
year end indices affect the value of assets under custody and administration and assets under management at those dates

products and services include custody  product and participant level accounting  daily pricing and administration  record keeping  investment manager and alternative investment manager operations outsourcing  master trust and master custody  and performance  risk and compliance analytics 
we are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the us we distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering clients a broad range of integrated products and services  including accounting  daily pricing and fund administration 
at december   we calculated approximately of the us mutual fund prices provided to nasdaq that appeared daily in the wall 
table of contents street journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 
we serviced us tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds  and we provided trust and valuation services for more than  daily priced portfolios at december  we are a service provider outside of the us as well 
in germany  italy and france  we provide depotbank services for retail and institutional fund assets  as well as custody and other services to pension plans and other institutional clients 
in the uk  we provide custody services for pension fund assets and administration services for mutual fund assets 
at december   we serviced approximately billion of offshore assets  primarily domiciled in ireland  luxembourg and the cayman islands 
at december   we had trillion of assets under administration in the asia pacific region  and in japan  we held approximately of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks in that region 
we are an alternative asset servicing provider worldwide  servicing hedge  private equity and real estate funds 
at december   we had approximately billion of alternative assets under administration 
the increase in servicing fees from primarily resulted from the impact on current period revenue of new business awarded to us and installed during and prior periods  the addition of a full year of revenue generated by the acquired intesa securities services and mourant international finance administration  or mifa  businesses and increases in daily average equity market valuations 
for  servicing fees generated outside the us were approximately of total servicing fees compared to approximately for at year end  our total assets under custody and administration were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the increase compared to was primarily the result of a higher level of new servicing business won and installed prior to december   partly offset by net client redemptions and distributions  as well as decreases in worldwide equity market valuations 
these asset levels as of year end did not reflect new business awarded to us during that had not been installed prior to december  the value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the values of assets under custody and administration do not necessarily result in proportional changes in our servicing fee revenue 
assets under custody and administration consisted of the following as of december assets under custody and administration as of december  annual growth rate compound annual growth rate dollars in billions mutual funds collective funds pension products insurance and other products total financial instrument mix of assets under custody and administration as of december  in billions equities fixed income short term and other investments total

management fees through ssga  we provide a broad range of investment management strategies  specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations  public funds  and other sophisticated investors 
based on assets under management at december   ssga was the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide  the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations primarily pension plans in the us  and the third largest investment manager overall in the world 
ssga offers a broad array of investment management strategies  including passive and active  such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies  using quantitative and fundamental methods for both us and global equities and fixed income securities 
ssga also offers exchange traded funds  or etfs  such as the spdr etf brand 
the increase in management fees from resulted primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations  the addition of revenue from the acquired biam business and  to a lesser extent  the impact of new business won and installed during and prior periods 
average month end equity market valuations  individually presented in the foregoing index table  increased an average of compared to management fees generated outside the us were approximately of total management fees for  up from for at year end  assets under management were trillion  compared to trillion at year end such amounts include assets of the spdr gold etf  for which we act as distribution agent rather than investment manager  and certain assets managed for the us government under programs adopted during the financial crisis 
while certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed  management fees reflect other factors as well  including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services  and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees 
the overall decrease in assets under management at december  compared to december   which can be seen in the tables that follow this discussion  generally reflected net lost business including the planned reduction associated with the us treasury s winding down of its portfolio of agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities and depreciation in the values of the assets managed 
these decreases were partly offset by the addition of approximately billion of managed assets from the biam acquisition 
passive fixed income assets under management declined year over year  mainly reflective of the sale of us government securities associated with the us treasury s winding down of its mortgage backed securities portfolio 
managed cash balances declined  and reflected the effect of reductions of securities lending volumes associated with continued weak loan demand 
these declines were partly offset by an increase in sales of passive exchange traded funds as well as other actively managed products 
the net lost business of billion for presented in the following analysis of activity in assets under management does not reflect billion of new business awarded to us during that had not been installed prior to december  this new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation  and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods

the following table presents activity in assets under management for the three years ended december assets under management years ended december  in billions balance at beginning of year net new lost business assets added from biam acquisition market appreciation depreciation balance at end of year amount for included the sale of approximately billion of us government securities associated with the us treasury s winding down of its portfolio of agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
future sales by the us treasury of the remaining portfolio of approximately billion  which are anticipated to occur in  will further reduce our assets under management 

table of contents trading services trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign exchange trading  as well as brokerage and other trading services 
we earn foreign exchange trading revenue by acting as a market maker 
we offer a range of foreign exchange  or fx  products  services and execution models which focus on clients global requirements for our proprietary research and the execution of trades in any time zone 
most of our fx products and execution models can be grouped into three broad categories direct fx  indirect fx  and electronic trading 
foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of client foreign exchange transactions  currency volatility  and the management of currency market risks 
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
direct and indirect fx revenue is recorded in foreign exchange trading revenue  revenue from electronic trading is recorded in brokerage and other trading services revenue 
trading services revenue increased  to billion  for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  in the same comparison  foreign exchange trading revenue increased to million for from million for the increase resulted from higher client volumes  which were up  partly offset by a decline in currency volatility 
we enter into fx transactions with clients and investment managers that contact our trading desk directly 
these trades are all executed at negotiated rates 
we refer to this activity  and our market making activities  as direct fx 
alternatively  clients or their investment managers may elect to route fx transactions to our fx desk through our asset servicing operation  we refer to this activity as indirect fx 
we execute indirect fx trades as a principal at rates based on a published formula 
we calculate revenue for indirect fx using an attribution methodology based on estimated effective mark ups downs and observed client volumes 
for the years ended december  and  our indirect fx revenue was approximately million and million  respectively  a decline of approximately year over year 
all other fx revenue not included in this indirect fx revenue  and unrelated to electronic trading  is considered by us to be direct fx revenue 
for the years ended december  and  our direct fx revenue was million and million  respectively  an increase of approximately year over year 
for the year ended december   our indirect fx revenue was approximately million  and our direct fx revenue was million 
our clients may choose to execute fx transactions through one of our electronic trading platforms 
this service generates revenue through a click fee 
for the years ended december  and  our revenue from electronic fx trading platforms  which is recorded in brokerage and other trading services revenue  was million and million  respectively  an increase of approximately year over year 
during  particularly in the second half of the year  some of our clients who relied on our indirect model to execute their fx transactions transitioned to other methods to conduct their fx transactions 
through state street  they can transition to either direct fx execution  including our street fx service where trades are executed at agreed upon benchmarks  where state street continues to act as a principal market maker  or to one of our electronic trading platforms 
brokerage and other trading services revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was largely related to higher electronic trading volumes and higher trading profits  partly offset by lower levels of revenue from transition management 
our transition management revenue was adversely affected by compliance issues in our uk business  the reputational impact of which may adversely affect our revenue from transition management in securities finance our securities finance business consists of two components investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives which are managed by ssga and engage in agency securities lending  which we refer to as the ssga lending funds  and an agency lending program for third party investment managers and asset owners  which we refer to as the agency lending funds 

table of contents our securities finance business provides liquidity to the financial markets  as well as an effective means for clients to earn incremental revenue on their securities portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity to clients worldwide 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair value of the loaned securities 
as the fair value of the loaned securities changes  additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower 
such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments 
we also participate in securities lending transactions as a principal  rather than an agent 
as principal  we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower  either a state street client or a broker dealer 
our involvement as principal is utilized when the lending client is unable to transact directly with the market and requires us to execute the transaction and furnish the securities 
we provide our credit rating to the transaction as well as our ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration 
for cash collateral  our clients pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and we invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities 
in some cases  the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by ssga 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue  composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral  is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral 
for  securities finance revenue increased from  substantially the result of higher spreads across all lending programs  partly offset by a decrease in average lending volumes 
average spreads increased for compared to  and securities on loan averaged billion for compared to billion for as previously reported  in december  we divided certain of the agency lending collateral pools into liquidity pools  from which clients can obtain cash redemptions  and duration pools  which are restricted and operate as liquidating accounts 
these actions were taken to provide greater flexibility to participants with respect to their control of their level of participation in our agency lending program 
as of december   the aggregate net assets of the liquidity pools and duration pools were billion and billion  respectively  compared to billion and billion  respectively  as of december  the decline in the aggregate net assets of the duration pools from year end reflected both pay downs on securities held by some of the pools and in kind redemptions by clients into separately managed accounts 
these declines were partly offset by improvement in the market value of securities held by the pools 
the return obligations of participants in the agency lending program represented by interests in the duration pools exceeded the market value of the assets in the duration pools by approximately million as of december   compared to million as of december  this amount is expected to be eliminated as the assets in the duration pools mature or pay down 
market influences continued to affect our revenue from  and the profitability of  our securities lending activities during  and may do so in future periods 
as long as securities lending spreads remain below the levels generally experienced prior to late  client demand is likely to remain at a reduced level and our revenues from our securities lending activities will be adversely affected relative to the revenues we earned in  which were extraordinarily high and in addition  proposed or anticipated regulatory changes may affect the volume of our securities lending activity and related revenue in future periods 
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  equity income from our joint venture 
table of contents investments  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of our investments in tax advantaged financings 
processing fees and other revenue declined to million for  from million for this decrease primarily resulted from fair value adjustments related to positions in the fixed income trading initiative  as well as lower net revenue from joint ventures 
net interest revenue net interest revenue is defined as total interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets  which principally consist of investment securities  interest bearing deposits with banks  repurchase agreements  loans and leases and other liquid assets  are financed primarily by client deposits  short term borrowings and long term debt 
net interest margin represents the relationship between annualized fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue and total average interest earning assets for the period 
revenue that is exempt from income taxes  mainly that earned from certain investment securities state and political subdivisions  is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal statutory income tax rate of  adjusted for applicable state income taxes  net of the related federal tax benefit 
the following tables present the components of average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities  related interest revenue and interest expense  and rates earned and paid  for the periods indicated years ended december  average balance interest revenue expense rate average balance interest revenue expense rate average balance interest revenue expense rate dollars in millions  fully taxable equivalent basis interest bearing deposits with banks securities purchased under resale agreements federal funds sold trading account assets investment securities investment securities purchased under amlf loans and leases other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits us non us securities sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased short term borrowings under amlf other short term borrowings long term debt other interest bearing liabilities total interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread net interest revenue fully taxable equivalent basis net interest margin fully taxable equivalent basis tax equivalent adjustment net interest revenue gaap basis amounts represent averages of asset backed commercial paper purchases from eligible unaffiliated money market mutual funds under the federal reserve s asset backed commercial paper money market mutual fund liquidity facility  or amlf  and associated borrowings 
the amlf expired in february 
table of contents for the year ended december  compared to  average interest earning assets were higher  mainly as a result of the impact of increases in interest bearing and noninterest bearing client deposits  as well as growth in the investment portfolio 
the increases in average deposits resulted from the additional deposits placed with us by clients amid market and public concerns related to various economic events  as well as the full year to date impact of the acquired intesa securities services business on aggregate deposits 
the growth in the investment portfolio resulted from our continued re investment strategy 
the incremental deposits were invested with the federal reserve and other central banks and used to reduce our us interest bearing deposits and other short term borrowings 
the investment of the incremental noninterest bearing deposits generated net interest revenue  but because the invested deposits increased our average interest earning assets  they negatively affected our net interest margin 
securities purchased under resale agreements increased as we reduced our us treasury holdings  given the extremely low yields offered for such investments 
for the year ended december   fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue declined compared to the same period in on a gaap basis  net interest revenue declined compared to the same period in the declines were mainly the result of lower discount accretion  more fully described below 
the level of accretion recorded was affected by sales of securities  particularly the december investment portfolio repositioning  and pay downs 
if the conduit related discount accretion were excluded  fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue for would have been billion billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of million compared to billion billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of million for this increase was primarily the result of lower funding costs  as market rates dropped throughout the year 
in addition  higher levels of client deposits replaced interest bearing short term funding  with the excess deposits invested with the federal reserve and non us central banks 
subsequent to the conduit consolidation  we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of billion million in  million in and million in 
the timing and ultimate recognition of discount accretion depends  in part  on factors that are outside of our control  including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality 
the impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions 
the timing and recognition of discount accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risks and other characteristics associated with our investment portfolio  including sales of securities which would otherwise generate accretion  such as the december investment portfolio repositioning 
depending on the factors discussed above  among others  we anticipate that  until the former conduit securities remaining in our portfolio mature or are sold  discount accretion will continue to contribute to our net interest revenue  and may increase the volatility of our net interest revenue and margin 
the december portfolio repositioning resulted in a significant decrease in the discount accretion that we recognized in  and that we expect to recognize in future periods 
assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity  all other things equal  we expect the remaining former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of december  to generate aggregate discount accretion in future periods of approximately billion over their remaining terms  with approximately half of this aggregate discount accretion to be recorded over the next four years 
changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below 
additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item interest bearing deposits with banks  including cash balances maintained at the federal reserve to satisfy reserve requirements  averaged billion for the year ended december   a significant increase compared to billion for the year ended december  an average of billion was held at the federal reserve bank during  compared to billion held during  with balances in both periods exceeding minimum reserve requirements 
the significant increase in the annual comparison reflected growth in noninterest bearing client deposits 

table of contents average securities purchased under resale agreements increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  average trading account assets increased to billion for the year ended december  from million for averages benefited largely from an increase in client demand associated with our trading activities 
in connection with these activities  we traded in highly liquid fixed income securities as principal with our custody clients and other third parties that trade in these securities 
our average investment securities portfolio increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the increase was generally the result of ongoing purchases of securities  partly offset by maturities and sales 
in december  we repositioned our portfolio by selling approximately billion of mortgage and asset backed securities and re investing approximately billion of the proceeds  primarily in agency mortgage backed securities 
the repositioning was undertaken to enhance our regulatory capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards  increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital  and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes 
during  we purchased billion of highly rated us treasury securities  federal agency mortgage backed securities and us and us asset backed securities 
as of december   securities rated aaa and aa comprised approximately of our portfolio  compared to rated aaa and aa as of december  loans and leases averaged billion for the year ended december   compared to billion for the increases primarily resulted from higher client demand for short duration liquidity  offset in part by a decrease in leases and the purchased receivables added in connection with the conduit consolidation  mainly from maturities and pay downs 
for and  approximately and  respectively  of our average loan and lease portfolio was composed of short duration advances that provided liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities related to securities settlement 
the following table presents average us and us short duration advances for the years indicated years ended december  in millions average us short duration advances average non us short duration advances total average short duration advances for the year ended december   the increase in average non us short duration advances compared to the prior year period was mainly due to activity associated with clients added in connection with the acquired intesa securities services business 
average other interest earning assets increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the increase was primarily the result of higher levels of cash collateral provided in connection with our role as principal in certain securities borrowing activities 
average interest bearing deposits increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the increase reflected client deposits added in connection with the may acquisition of the intesa securities services business  and higher levels of non us transaction accounts associated with new and existing business in assets under custody and administration 
average other short term borrowings declined to billion for the year ended december  from billion for  as the higher levels of client deposits provided additional liquidity 
average long term debt increased to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the same period in the increase primarily reflected the issuance of an aggregate of billion of senior notes by us in march  partly offset by the maturities of billion of senior notes in february and billion of senior notes in september  both previously issued by state street bank under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
additional information about our long term debt is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
table of contents average other interest bearing liabilities increased to billion for the year ended december  from million for the increase was primarily the result of higher levels of client cash collateral received in connection with our role as principal in certain securities lending activities 
several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin  including the mix of client liabilities  actions of the various central banks  changes in us and us interest rates  the various yield curves around the world  the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment portfolio  and the relative impact of the yields earned on the securities purchased by us with the proceeds from the december portfolio repositioning and other maturities compared to the yields earned on the securities sold or matured 
based on market conditions and other factors  we have continued to re invest the proceeds from pay downs and maturities of securities in highly rated investment securities  such as us treasuries and federal agency mortgage backed securities and us and us mortgage and asset backed securities 
the pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on the impact of market conditions and other factors over time 
these factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what effect our re investment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin

impairment related to expected losses represents the difference between the discounted values of the expected future cash flows from the securities compared to their current amortized cost basis  with each discount rate commensurate with the effective yield on the underlying security 
for debt securities held to maturity  other than temporary impairment remaining after credit related impairment which credit related impairment is recorded in our consolidated statement of income is recognized  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated statement of condition  and is accreted prospectively over the remaining terms of the securities based on the timing of their estimated future cash flows 
for other than temporary impairment of debt securities that results from our decision to sell the security prior to its recovery in value  the entire difference between the security s fair value and its amortized cost basis is recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
additional information about investment securities  the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains and our process to identify other than temporary impairment  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item provision for loan losses we recorded no provisions for loan losses in  compared to million in the substantial majority of the provision recorded in resulted from changes in expectations with respect to future cash flows from certain commercial real estate  or cre  loan portfolio acquired in pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy 
the cre loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and any provisions for loan losses that are recorded reflect management s current expectations with respect to future cash flows from these loans  based on an assessment of economic conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors

the million of insurance recoveries that reduced other expenses for was received with respect to settlement payments made by us to clients in prior periods in connection with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga prior to august we account for insurance recoveries as gains when payments for the recoveries are received 
acquisition costs in  we incurred acquisition costs of million  substantially related to integration costs incurred in connection with our acquisitions of biam  the intesa securities services business and mifa 
these acquisition costs were offset by a million indemnification benefit for an income tax claim related to the acquisition of the intesa securities services business 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for additional information with respect to the indemnification benefit 
restructuring charges in  we recorded million of aggregate restructuring charges in connection with two significant plans our continued implementation of our business operations and information technology transformation program million  and expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets facing businesses in million 
each of these plans is described below 
business operations and information technology transformation program in november  we announced a global multi year business operations and information technology transformation program 
the program includes operational  information technology and targeted cost initiatives  including plans related to reductions in both staff and occupancy costs 

table of contents with respect to our business operations  we are standardizing certain core business processes  primarily through our execution of the state street lean methodology  and driving automation of these business processes 
we are currently creating a new technology platform  including transferring certain core software applications to a private cloud  and have expanded our use of service providers associated with components of our technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support 
we expect the transfer of core software applications to a private cloud to occur primarily in and to implement this program  we expect to incur aggregate pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million to million over the four year period ending december  to date  we have recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million in our consolidated statement of income  composed of million in and million in the following table presents the charges by type of cost in millions employee related costs real estate consolidation information technology costs total total the employee related costs included costs related to severance  benefits and outplacement services 
real estate consolidation costs resulted from actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through consolidation of leases and properties 
information technology costs included transition fees related to the above described expansion of our use of service providers 
in  in connection with the program  we initiated the involuntary termination of  employees  or approximately of our global workforce  which was substantially complete at the end of in addition  in the third quarter of  in connection with the expansion of our use of service providers associated with our information technology infrastructure and application maintenance and support  we identified employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated 
as of december   in connection with the planned aggregate staff reductions of  employees described above   employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street  including employees in in connection with our continued implementation of the business operations and information technology transformation program  we achieved approximately million of annual pre tax  run rate expense savings in compared to run rate expenses 
excluding the expected aggregate restructuring charges of million to million described earlier  we expect the program to reduce our pre tax expenses from operations  on an annualized basis  by approximately million to million by the end of compared to  with the full effect realized in assuming all other things equal  we expect to achieve aggregate annual pre tax expense savings of approximately million by the end of  for a total annual pre tax expense savings of approximately million to be realized in we expect the business operations transformation component of the program to result in annual pre tax expense savings of approximately million in  with the majority of these savings expected to be achieved by the end of in addition  we expect the information technology transformation component of the program to result in annual pre tax expense savings of approximately million in these annual pre tax run rate savings relate only to the business operations and information technology transformation program 
our actual operating expenses may increase or decrease as a result of other factors 
the majority of the annualized savings will affect compensation and employee benefits expenses  these savings will be modestly offset by increases in information systems and communications expenses as we implement the program 
expense control measures during the fourth quarter of  in connection with expense control measures designed to calibrate our expenses to our outlook for our capital markets facing businesses in  we took two actions 
first  we 
table of contents withdrew from our fixed income trading initiative  under which we traded in fixed income securities and derivatives as principal with our custody clients and other third parties that trade in these securities and derivatives 
we undertook this withdrawal as a result of continuing market turmoil  as well as evolving regulatory changes that likely would have required us to increase our regulatory capital and expenses associated with this initiative 
second  we instituted targeted staff reductions 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring charges of million in our consolidated statement of income 
the following table presents the charges by type of cost in millions employee related costs fixed income trading portfolio asset and other write offs total the employee related costs included costs related to severance  benefits and outplacement services related to both aspects of the expense control measures 
in connection with these measures  we identified employees who will be provided with severance and outplacement services as their roles are eliminated 
as of december   employees had been involuntarily terminated and left state street  and an additional employees were involuntarily terminated and left state street in january the fixed income trading portfolio related costs resulted from fair value adjustments to the initiative s trading portfolio related to our decision to withdraw from the initiative 
costs for asset and other write offs related to other asset write downs and contract terminations 
as a result of the withdrawal from the fixed income trading initiative  we intend to wind down that initiative s remaining derivatives portfolio 
at december   this portfolio consisted primarily of derivative assets with an aggregate fair value of approximately billion and derivative liabilities with an aggregate fair value of approximately billion 
in future periods during which the portfolio is wound down  the impact of economic and market conditions  including changes in credit profiles and currency and yield spreads  on the valuation of  or trade execution for  the portfolio could result in additional fair value adjustments 
aggregate restructuring related accrual activity the following table presents aggregate activity associated with accruals that resulted from the charges associated with the business operations and information technology transformation program and the expense control measures in millions employee related costs real estate consolidation information technology costs fixed income trading portfolio asset and other write offs total initial accrual for business operations and information technology transformation program payments balance at december  additional accruals for business operations and information technology transformation program accruals for expense control measures payments and adjustments balance at december

in addition  income tax expense for included million related to a settlement with italian tax authorities associated with tax assessments issued to an italian banking subsidiary acquired by us in connection with our acquisition of the intesa securities services business 
we recorded an offsetting indemnification benefit in acquisition costs  as described earlier under expenses 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item for additional information about the tax settlement and income taxes 
line of business information we have two lines of business investment servicing and investment management 
given our services and management organization  the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies  including companies in the financial services industry

the increase in total fee revenue generally related to servicing fees  securities finance and trading services revenue  and was partly offset by a decline in processing fees and other revenue

the level of accretion recorded in was significantly affected by our december investment portfolio repositioning 
a portion of net interest revenue is allocated to the investment management business line based on the volume of client liabilities attributable to that line of business

investment management total revenue for increased compared to  generally the result of higher levels of management fees 
the increase in management fees  generated by ssga  resulted primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations  the addition of revenue from the acquired biam business and  to a lesser extent  the impact of new business won and installed during and prior periods 
securities finance revenue declined because of reduced utilization of lendable assets in the ssga lending funds and the transition of assets by clients from lending to non lending products

approximately of our servicing fees were generated outside the us in  compared with in assets under custody and administration were trillion  compared to trillion in  with the increase from primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new servicing business won and installed prior to december   as well as the effects of the intesa and mifa acquisitions

approximately of our management fees were generated outside the us in  down from in assets under management increased to trillion at december   up billion from trillion a year earlier 
trading services revenue increased primarily as a result of higher electronic trading volumes  partly offset by a decrease in foreign exchange trading revenue as a result of lower spreads on foreign exchange trades and a decline in currency volatility  partly offset by higher client volumes 
securities finance revenue was down as a result of lower spreads across all lending programs 
processing fees and other revenue increased due to higher net revenue from structured products  including fees from our tax exempt investment program  and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments 
net interest revenue increased primarily as a result of the impact of a higher portfolio allocation to fixed rate investment securities  us and non us investment portfolio growth  and the impact of the deposits added in may in connection with the acquisition of the intesa securities services business  partly offset by lower spreads on both floating rate investment securities and non us transaction deposits 
we recorded net realized losses of million from sales of investment securities and  separately  losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of million for  compared to net sale gains of million and losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of million for in december  we undertook a repositioning of our investment securities portfolio by selling approximately 
table of contents billion of securities 
the repositioning was undertaken to enhance our capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards  increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital  and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes 
the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million  which was recorded in our consolidated statement of income and is reflected in the million of net sale losses described above 
as a result  net losses related to investment securities for totaled million  compared to net gains of million for for  the substantial majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses resulting from deterioration in financial performance of those securities during the year 
provision for loan losses we recorded provisions for loan losses of million in and million in the substantial majority of the provisions recorded in both years resulted from changes in expectations with respect to future cash flows from certain cre loans acquired in in connection with the indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy

the increase in information systems and communications expenses for compared to reflected higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software for our global infrastructure  as well as the addition of expenses from the acquired intesa securities services business and mifa subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
transaction processing services expenses increased due to higher levels of sub custody expenses and higher external contract services costs related to increases in transaction volumes 
in june  we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of million  which included million of associated legal costs 
the charge provided for a one time cash contribution of million to the cash collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the ssga lending funds  which reflected our cost to restore the net asset 
table of contents value per unit of such collateral pools to as of june  as a result of this contribution  ssga removed the redemption restrictions from these ssga lending funds in august we also established a million reserve to address potential inconsistencies in connection with our implementation of redemption restrictions applicable to the collateral pools underlying our agency lending program 
the provision for fixed income litigation exposure of million in resulted from an increase in the reserve initially established in associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga 
we settled regulatory inquiries related to this exposure in february in  we recorded acquisition and restructuring costs of million 
these costs included million of integration costs  million of which related to the acquired intesa securities services business and mifa 
these integration costs consisted only of certain transaction related costs and direct incremental costs to integrate the acquired businesses into our operations  and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization 
the remaining million was composed of restructuring charges recorded in connection with our business operations and information technology transformation program announced in november the million of charges consisted of employee related costs for severance and other termination benefits  as well as costs which resulted from actions taken to consolidate real estate 
the decrease in aggregate other expenses professional services  amortization of other intangible assets  securities processing  regulator fees and assessments  and other for compared to resulted primarily from the impact of an adverse judgment of million rendered by a netherlands court in  the impact of million of insurance recoveries received in and lower levels of fdic assessments 
this overall decrease was offset slightly by a higher level of other intangible assets amortization associated with the acquisition of the intesa securities services business and mifa 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for  compared to income tax expense before extraordinary loss of million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for the decline in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to transactions in connection with which we incurred costs to terminate funding obligations that supported former conduit asset structures  the partial write off of a deferred tax asset associated with certain of the investment securities sold in connection with the portfolio repositioning completed in the fourth quarter of  and the absence of the impact of the non deductible portion of the ssga related legal reserve established in financial condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses 
our clients needs and our operating objectives determine balance sheet volume  mix and currency denomination 
as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our clients 
deposits and other liabilities generated by client activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities  although the weighted average maturities of our assets are significantly longer than the contractual maturities of our liabilities 
our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market instruments  such as interest bearing deposits and securities purchased under resale agreements 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
as our non us business activities have continued to grow  we have expanded our capabilities and processes to enable us to manage the liabilities generated by our core businesses and the related assets in which 
table of contents these liabilities are invested  in a manner that more closely aligns our businesses and related activities with the cash management  investment activities and other operations of our clients 
as a result  the structure of our statement of condition continues to evolve to reflect these efforts 
in connection with the growth in non us business  our cross border outstandings have increased as we have invested in higher levels of non us assets

we consider a well diversified  high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated statement of condition 

table of contents the portfolio is concentrated in securities with high credit quality  with approximately of the carrying value of the portfolio rated aaa or aa as of december  the following table presents the percentages of the carrying value of the portfolio  by external credit rating  as of december aaa aa a bbb below bbb includes us treasury securities that are split rated  aaa by moody s investor services and aa by standard poor s 
as of december   the investment portfolio of approximately  securities was diversified with respect to asset class 
approximately of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio as of that date was composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the predominantly floating rate asset backed portfolio consisted primarily of student loan backed and credit card backed securities 
mortgage backed securities were composed of securities issued by the federal national mortgage association and federal home loan mortgage corporation  as well as us and us large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations 
non us debt securities approximately of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio as of december  was composed of non us debt securities

as of 
table of contents december   the securities had an aggregate pre tax net unrealized loss of approximately million and an average market to book ratio of 
the majority is floating rate securities  and accordingly the aggregate holdings are considered to have minimal interest rate risk 
the underlying collateral primarily includes uk prime mortgages  australian and netherlands mortgages  canadian government securities and german automobile loans 
the other category of available for sale securities includes approximately million and million of securities as of december  and  respectively  related to portugal and ireland  all of which are mortgage backed securities 
the other category of held to maturity securities includes approximately million and million of securities as of december  and  respectively  related to portugal  ireland and greece  all of which are mortgage backed securities 
our aggregate exposure to the peripheral european countries of spain  italy  ireland  greece and portugal as of december  included no direct sovereign debt exposure to these countries 
our indirect exposure to these countries was substantially composed of approximately billion of mortgage and asset backed securities  with an aggregate pre tax gross unrealized loss of approximately million as of december  we recorded no other than temporary impairment on these securities in the global economic downturn  coupled with the failure of the eurozone countries to abide by the terms of the eurozone stability pact  led to significant borrowing at advantageous rates  particularly by the above mentioned peripheral countries  while those countries failed to address their underlying uncompetitive economies 
these events led to the sovereign debt crisis when these fundamental issues caused severe stresses within the eurozone 
this sovereign crisis in europe has deteriorated with little sign of improvement in the peripheral countries economies 
peripheral country risks are identified  assessed and monitored by our country and counterparty exposure committee 
country limits are defined in our credit and counterparty risk guidelines  in accordance with our credit and counterparty risk policy 
these limits are monitored on a daily basis by enterprise risk management 
all peripheral country exposures are subject to ongoing surveillance and subjected to stress test analysis  conducted by the investment portfolio management team 
the stress tests performed reflect the structure and nature of the exposure  its past and likely future performance based on macroeconomic and environmental analysis  with key underlying assumptions varied under a range of scenarios  reflecting likely downward pressure on collateral performance from the sovereign crisis and related austerity measures 
the results of the stress tests are presented to senior management and enterprise risk management as part of the surveillance process 
in addition  enterprise risk management conducts stress test analyses and evaluates exposures for evaluation of other than temporary impairment 
the assumptions used in the evaluation process are stressed to reflect likely downward pressure on collateral performance from the sovereign crisis and related austerity measures and their economic impact 
evaluations of exposure to greece are based on that country remaining a member of the eurozone under all scenarios 
stress scenarios are subject to regular review and updated to reflect changes in the economic environment  measures taken in response to the sovereign crisis and collateral performance  with particular attention to our peripheral country exposures

table of contents impairment the following table presents net unrealized losses on securities available for sale as of december in millions fair value amortized cost net unrealized loss  pre tax net unrealized loss  after tax the net unrealized amounts presented above excluded the remaining net unrealized losses related to reclassifications of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity 
these unrealized losses related to reclassifications totaled million  or million after tax  and million  or million after tax  as of december  and  respectively  and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  or oci 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the decline in these remaining after tax unrealized losses related to reclassifications from december  to december  resulted primarily from amortization 
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists 
to the extent that other than temporary impairment is identified  the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non credit component 
the credit component is recorded in our consolidated statement of income  and the non credit component is recorded in oci to the extent that we do not intend to sell the security 
our assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation  more fully described in note  of economic and security specific factors 
such factors are based on estimates  derived by management  which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance 
to the extent that market conditions are worse than management s expectations  other than temporary impairment could increase  in particular  the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage and asset backed securities  to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks  the performance of the us housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio s credit performance 
as such  our assessment of other than temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices 
generally  indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears 
as of september   national housing prices  according to the case shiller national home price index  had declined by approximately peak to current 
overall  management s expectation  for purposes of its evaluation of other than temporary impairment as of december   was that housing prices would decline by approximately peak to trough 
the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages of securities continues to deteriorate 
in addition  management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above 
the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management s overall loss expectations 
our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management s estimates of future cumulative losses 
ultimately  other than temporary impairment is based on specific cusip level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security 
in addition  we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non agency us residential mortgage backed portfolio 
we estimate  for example  that other than temporary impairment of the investment portfolio could increase by approximately million to million  if national housing prices were to decline by to peak to trough  compared to management s expectation of described above 
this sensitivity estimate is based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults 
to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management s current expectations  resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated 
excluding the securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in  management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining 
table of contents securities and the resulting net unrealized losses as of december  to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities 
additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in late  several major us financial institutions participated in a mortgage foreclosure moratorium with respect to residential mortgages 
while the moratorium has been lifted  the residential mortgage servicing environment remains challenging  and the timeline to liquidate distressed loans continues to extend 
the rate at which distressed residential mortgages are liquidated may affect  among other things  our investment securities portfolio 
such effects could include the timing of cash flows or the credit quality associated with the mortgages collateralizing certain of our residential mortgage backed securities  which  accordingly  could result in the recognition of additional other than temporary impairment in future periods 
loans and leases the following table presents us and us loans and leases  by segment  and aggregate average loans and leases  as of and for the years ended december excluding the allowance for loan losses in millions institutional us non us commercial real estate us total loans and leases average loans and leases additional detail about these loan and lease segments  including underlying classes  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the institutional segment is composed of the following classes investment funds  commercial and financial  purchased receivables and lease financing 
investment funds includes lending to mutual and other collective investment funds and short duration advances to fund clients to provide liquidity in support of their transaction flows associated with securities settlement activities 
commercial and financial includes lending to corporate borrowers  including broker dealers 
purchased receivables represents undivided interests in securitized pools of underlying third party receivables added in connection with the conduit consolidation 
lease financing includes our investment in leveraged lease financing 
as of december  and  unearned income deducted from our investment in leveraged lease financing was million and million  respectively  for us leases and million and million  respectively  for non us leases 
aggregate short duration advances to our clients included in the institutional segment were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the commercial real estate  or cre  loans were acquired in pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy 
these loans  which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate  were recorded at their then current fair value  based on management s expectations with respect to future cash flows from the loans using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition 
as of december  and  we held an aggregate of approximately million and million  respectively  of cre loans which were modified in troubled debt restructurings 
no impairment loss was recognized upon restructuring of the loans  as the discounted cash flows of the modified loans exceeded the carrying amount of the original loans as of the modification date 
no loans were modified in troubled debt restructurings in 
table of contents we define past due loans as loans on which contractual principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but for which interest continues to be accrued 
no institutional loans were days or more contractually past due as of december     or although a portion of the cre loans was days or more contractually past due as of december    and  we do not report them as past due loans  because in accordance with gaap  the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from management s expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date  not the loans contractual payment terms 
these cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in management s expectations  which consider market conditions 
we generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the aforementioned cre loans had been placed by management on non accrual status  as the yield associated with these loans  determined when the loans were acquired  was deemed to be non accretable 
this determination was based on management s expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans 
the decline in loans on non accrual status at december  compared to december  resulted mainly from the transfer of certain cre loans to other real estate owned in in connection with foreclosure or similar transactions 
these transactions had no impact on our consolidated statement of income

cross border outstandings cross border outstandings are amounts payable to state street by non us counterparties which are denominated in non us dollars or other non local currency  as well as non us local currency claims not funded by local currency liabilities 
our cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks  loans and lease financing  including short duration advances  investment securities  amounts related to foreign exchange and interest rate contracts  and securities finance 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations 
we place deposits with non us counterparties that have strong internal state street risk ratings 
counterparties are approved and monitored by our country and counterparty exposure committee 
this process includes financial analysis of non us counterparties and the use of an internal risk rating system 
each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on deteriorating credit fundamentals or general market conditions 
we also utilize risk mitigation and other facilities that may reduce our exposure through the use of cash collateral and or balance sheet netting 
in addition  the country and counterparty exposure committee performs a country risk analysis and monitors limits on country exposure 

table of contents the following table presents cross border outstandings in countries in which we do business  the on balance sheet portion of which amounted to at least of our consolidated total assets as of december the aggregate on balance sheet cross border outstandings presented in the table represented  and of our consolidated total assets as of december   and  respectively

there were no aggregate on balance sheet cross border outstandings to countries which totaled between and of our consolidated total assets as of december  several european countries  particularly portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain  have experienced credit deterioration associated with weaknesses in their economic and fiscal situations 
with respect to this ongoing uncertainty  we are closely monitoring our exposure to these countries 
while we had no sovereign debt securities related to these countries in our investment portfolio  we had aggregate exposure of approximately billion of mortgage and asset backed securities  composed of million in spain  million in italy  million in ireland  million in greece and million in portugal  as of december  the following table presents our aggregate exposure in each of these countries as of december in millions investment securities and other assets off balance sheet total cross border exposure italy ireland spain portugal greece italy ireland spain portugal greece as of december   none of the on balance sheet exposures in these countries was individually greater than of our consolidated total assets

we had not recorded any other than temporary impairment or provisions for loan losses with respect to any of our exposures in these countries as of december  
table of contents capital the management of both regulatory and economic capital involves key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  is in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an appropriate level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our regulatory capital requirements  the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers 
our asset  liability and capital committee  referred to as alcco  oversees the management of our regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for regulatory capital purposes is the federal reserve 
both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of state street bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
the following table presents regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank as of december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for additional information regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
at december   state street s and state street bank s tier and total risk based capital ratios declined compared to december  higher capital associated with net income and the remarketing of subordinated debt partly offset by the effect of purchases of our common stock and declarations of common stock dividends was more than offset by increases in total risk weighted assets 
balance sheet growth mainly associated with higher levels of investment securities  the result of our re investment strategy  drove the increase in total risk weighted assets 
higher off balance sheet exposure associated with our securities finance agency lending business  the result of market conditions  also contributed to the increase in total risk weighted assets 
the decline in the tier leverage ratio for both entities generally resulted from a significant increase in adjusted quarterly average assets  mainly the result of the above mentioned re investment strategy and significantly higher average interest bearing deposits with banks that resulted from high levels of client deposits 
these incremental client deposits were invested with central banks  including the federal reserve 
as of december   regulatory capital ratios for state street and state street bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 

table of contents in  we issued approximately million of junior subordinated debentures due march   in a remarketing of the junior subordinated debentures due originally issued to state street capital trust iii in the original debentures were issued to capital trust iii in connection with our concurrent offering of the trust s fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities  referred to as normal apex refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
the net proceeds from the sale of the remarketed junior subordinated debentures were ultimately used by capital trust iii to make a final distribution to the holders of the normal apex with respect to the original junior subordinated debentures and to satisfy the obligation of capital trust iii to purchase million of our non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a   liquidation preference per share 
the preferred stock constitutes the principal asset of the trust 
as a result of the above described transactions  as of december  we had outstanding the above referenced million of junior subordinated debentures due march  and million of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock 
the debentures qualify for inclusion in tier regulatory capital and the perpetual preferred stock qualifies for inclusion in tier regulatory capital  both under federal regulatory capital guidelines 
the original junior subordinated debentures  which qualified for inclusion in tier regulatory capital as trust preferred securities  were canceled as a result of the remarketing transaction 
common stock in  our board of directors approved a new program authorizing the purchase by us of up to million of our common stock in this new program superseded the board s prior authorization under which million common shares were available for purchase as of december  during the period from april  through december   we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock  at an average cost per share of approximately and an aggregate cost of approximately million 
as of december   no purchase authority remained under this program 
adjusting for shares of common stock issued in connection with employee compensation  at december   we had approximately million less common shares outstanding compared to december  as a result of completion of the stock purchase program 
during  we declared aggregate common stock dividends of per share  or approximately million 
these dividends compare to aggregate common stock dividends of per share  or million  for all of  and represented the first increase in our quarterly common stock dividend since we announced a reduction of such dividends in the first quarter of funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock is reviewed regularly and determined by the board considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
in addition  the prior approval of the federal reserve is required for us to pay future common stock dividends 
the federal reserve is currently conducting a review of capital plans for submitted by us and other systemically important financial institutions  which capital plans include tests of our capital adequacy under various stress scenarios 
the levels at which we will be able to declare dividends and purchase shares of our common stock during will depend on the federal reserve s assessment of our capital plan and our projected performance under the stress scenarios 
while we anticipate that we will obtain federal reserve approval for the continued return of capital to our shareholders through dividends and or common stock purchases in  there can be no assurance with respect to the federal reserve s assessment of our capital plan 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends 
information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
table of contents other the current minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the us banking regulators are based on a international accord  commonly referred to as basel i  which was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision 
in  the basel committee released the final version of its new capital adequacy framework  referred to as basel ii 
basel ii governs the capital adequacy of large  internationally active banking organizations  such as state street  that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems  and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align regulatory capital requirements with those risks 
basel ii adopts a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy minimum capital requirements  which incorporates pillar  the measurement of credit risk  market risk and operational risk  pillar  supervisory review  which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk  rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement  and pillar  market discipline  which imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organization s risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital 
in december  us banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the basel ii framework in the us the framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the us  and explicitly reserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate 
prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  state street is required to complete a defined qualification period  during which it must demonstrate that it complies with the related regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the federal reserve 
state street is currently in the qualification period for basel ii 
in addition  in response to the recent financial crisis and ongoing global financial market dynamics  the basel committee has proposed new guidelines  referred to as basel iii 
basel iii would establish more stringent capital and liquidity requirements  including higher minimum regulatory capital ratios  new capital buffers  higher risk weighted asset calibrations  more restrictive definitions of qualifying capital  a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio 
basel iii  the dodd frank act and the resulting regulations are expected to result in an increase in the minimum regulatory capital that we will be required to maintain and changes in the manner in which our regulatory capital ratios are calculated 
we are currently designated as a large bank holding company subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards  commonly referred to as a systemically important financial institution  or sifi  and we are one among an initial group of institutions worldwide that have been identified by the financial stability board and the basel committee on banking supervision as global systemically important banks  or g sibs 
both of these designations will require us to hold incrementally higher regulatory capital compared to financial institutions without such designations 
the basel iii requirements  as well as related provisions of the dodd frank act and other international regulatory initiatives  could have a material impact on our businesses and our profitability 
us banking regulators will be required to enact new rules specific to the us banking industry to implement the final basel iii accord 
consequently  determining with certainty at this time the alignment of our regulatory capital and our operations with the regulatory capital requirements of basel iii  or when we will be expected to be compliant with the basel regulatory capital requirements  is not possible 
we believe  however  that we will be able to comply with the relevant basel ii and basel iii regulatory capital requirements when and as applied to us 
economic capital we define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt  and obligations higher in priority  against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa aa senior bank debt rating 
economic capital requirements are one of 
table of contents several important measures used by management and the board of directors to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to state street s risk profile 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies  assumptions  and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities 
in addition  we have begun to measure returns on economic capital and economic profit defined by us as net income available to common shareholders after deduction of state street s cost of equity capital by line of business 
this economic profit will be used by management and the board to gauge risk adjusted performance over time 
this in turn has become an element of our internal process for allocating resources  eg  capital  information technology spending  etc  by line of business 
in addition  this augments our current use of return on capital in our evaluation of the viability of a new business or product initiative and for merger and acquisition analysis 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities  interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition  credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty  operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events  which is consistent with the basel ii definition  and business risk the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of our business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks 
economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using scenario analysis and statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our clients and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
significant uses of liquidity  described more fully below  consist primarily of funding deposit withdrawals and outstanding commitments to extend credit or commitments to purchase securities as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by the asset structure in our consolidated statement of condition 
our global treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alcco 
management maintains a liquidity framework which assesses the sources and uses of liquidity 
monitoring of our liquidity position is conducted by global treasury and our enterprise risk management group 
embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several areas of potential risk based on our activities  size  and other appropriate risk related factors 
we use liquidity metrics  early warning indicators and stress testing to identify potential liquidity needs 

table of contents these measures are a combination of internal and external events which assist us in identifying potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash  as well as the potential impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
another important component of the liquidity framework is a contingency funding plan  or cfp  that is designed to identify and manage state street through a potential liquidity crisis 
the cfp defines roles  responsibilities and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
specific actions are linked to the level of stress indicated by these measures or by management judgment of market conditions 
we generally manage our liquidity on a global basis at the state street consolidated level 
we also manage parent company liquidity  and in certain cases branch liquidity  separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
the parent company typically holds enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with its banking subsidiaries  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs  as well as those projected over the next one year period 
our sources of liquidity come from two primary areas access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition 
our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would access to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below 
on balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy 
these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets  but more importantly  they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales 
state street is also a member of the federal home loan bank of boston 
this membership allows for advances of liquidity in varying terms against high quality collateral  which helps facilitate asset and liability management of depository institutions 
there were no balances outstanding under this facility at december  or each of these sources of liquidity is used in our management of daily cash needs and is available in a crisis scenario should we need to accommodate potential large  unexpected demand for funds 
our uses of liquidity generally result from the following withdrawals of unsecured client deposits  draw downs of unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities  generally provided through lines of credit  and short duration advance facilities 
client deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities  and are invested in a combination of investment securities and short term money market instruments whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits 
most of the client deposits are payable on demand or are short term in nature  which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts 
similarly  clients can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit  or can overdraw their deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include  among other things  adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs  and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities  which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our clients 
in managing our liquidity  we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit  or cds  and invested those funds in short term money market instruments which are carried in our consolidated statement of condition and which would be available to meet our cash needs 
at december   this wholesale cd portfolio totaled billion  compared to billion at december  at december   we had no conduit issued asset backed commercial paper outstanding to third parties  compared to billion at december  while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control  and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets 
table of contents using our securities as collateral 
our net liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets  such as interest bearing deposits with banks  which are multi currency instruments invested with major multi national banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly 
as of december   the value of our consolidated net liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion  compared to billion as of december  for the year ended december   consolidated average net liquid assets were billion  compared to billion for the year ended december  due to the unusual size and volatile nature of client deposits as of quarter end  we maintained excess balances of approximately billion at central banks as of december   compared to billion as of december  as of december   the value of the parent company s net liquid assets totaled billion  compared with billion as of december  the parent company s liquid assets consisted primarily of overnight placements with its banking subsidiaries 
aggregate investment securities carried at billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation  unless pledged internally between state street affiliates 
liquid assets included securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston to secure state street bank s ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise 
this access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for state street bank 
as of december   state street bank had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window 
based on our level of consolidated liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration  management considers state street s overall liquidity as of december  to be sufficient to meet its current commitments and business needs  including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its clients 
as referenced above  our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global capital markets and client deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by increasing the potential market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates

additional information about commitments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item risk management the global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function 
the identification  measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach allows for an assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balances risk and return 
we have a disciplined approach to risk that involves all levels of management 
the board  through its risk and capital committee  provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s risk appetite statement  which is an integral part of our overall internal capital adequacy assessment process  or icaap 
the risk appetite statement outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define and constrain our risk appetite and defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits  which are reported regularly to the board 
in addition  state street utilizes a variety of key risk indicators to monitor risk on a more granular level 
enterprise risk management  or erm  a corporate function  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units independent of the business units activities  and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits and  in collaboration with business unit management  monitors key risks 
our chief risk officer meets regularly with the board and its risk and capital committee  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties with respect to the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is designing and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards  and providing oversight of the business owned risks 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility between erm and the business units  and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 

table of contents responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees  as well as the board s risk and capital committee 
the management risk and capital committee  or mrac  co chaired by our chief risk officer and chief financial officer  is the senior management decision making body for risk and capital issues  and is responsible for ensuring that state street s strategy  budget  risk appetite and capital adequacy are properly aligned 
alcco  chaired by our treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated statement of condition  the management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions  our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure  and debt and equity issuances 
state street s risk management program is supported by the activities of a number of corporate risk oversight committees  chaired by senior executives within erm 
our fiduciary review committee reviews and assesses the risk management programs of those units in which state street serves in a fiduciary capacity 
our credit committee acts as the credit and counterparty risk guidelines committee for state street 
our country and counterparty exposure committee ensures that country risks are identified  assessed  monitored  reported and mitigated where necessary 
our operational risk committee provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify  measure  manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
our model assessment committee provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates financial models utilized by our business units 
while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices 
state street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
the market risk management processes related to these activities  discussed in further detail below  apply to both on and off balance sheet exposures 
we engage in trading and investment activities primarily to support our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall risk appetite  objectives and liquidity needs  our clients requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
trading activities market risk associated with our foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines  including established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  or var  described later in this section  to measure  monitor and manage market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are generally intended to generate trading revenue and to manage potential earnings volatility 
in addition  we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets 
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  our clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these client needs 

table of contents as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  and interest rate futures 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was trillion  of which trillion was composed of foreign exchange forward  swap and spot contracts 
in the aggregate  positions are matched closely to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
additional information about our trading derivatives is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements under item as noted above  we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies  including var  which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a risk measurement methodology to estimate var daily 
we have adopted standards for estimating var  and we maintain regulatory capital for market risk in accordance with applicable bank regulatory market risk guidelines 
var is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated var more than of the time  or less than three business days out of a year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates  us and us interest rates and implied volatilities  and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  our historical simulation var methodology is subject to inherent limitations and assumptions 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day 
therefore  implicit in the var estimate is the assumption that no intra day actions are taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not incorporate risk associated with intra day changes in positions or intra day price volatility 
in addition to daily var measurement  we regularly perform stress tests 
these stress tests consider historical events  such as the asian financial crisis or the most recent crisis in the financial markets  as well as hypothetical scenarios defined by us  such as parallel and non parallel changes in yield curves 
our var model incorporates exposures to more than  factors  composed of foreign exchange spot rates  interest rate base and spread curves and implied volatility levels and skews 
the following table presents var associated with our trading activities  for trading positions held during the periods indicated  as measured by our var methodology 
the generally lower total var amounts compared to component var amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types 
value at risk year ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum foreign exchange rates interest rates total var for trading assets our historical simulation var methodology recognizes diversification benefits by fully revaluing our portfolio using historical market information 
as a result  this historical simulation better captures risk by incorporating  by construction  any diversification benefits or concentration risks in our portfolio related to market factors which have historically moved in correlated or independent directions and amounts 
consistent with current bank regulatory market risk guidelines  our var measurement includes certain positions held outside of our regular sales and trading activities  but carried in trading account assets in our consolidated statement of condition and covered by those guidelines 
we do not have a historical simulation var model that covers positions outside of our regular sales and trading activities 
consequently  we compute the 
table of contents var associated with those assets using a separate model  which we then add to the var associated with our sales and trading activities to derive state street s total regulatory var 
although this simple addition does not give full recognition to the benefits of diversification of our business  we believe that this approach is both conservative and consistent with the way in which we manage those businesses 
we perform ongoing integrity testing of our var models to validate that the model forecasts are reasonable when compared to actual results 
our actual daily trading profit and loss  or p l  is generally greater than hypothetical daily trading p l due to our ability to manage our positions through intra day trading and other pricing considerations 
as such  while we have not seen any back testing exceptions to the var model in comparison to actual daily trading p l  we do from time to time see back testing exceptions on a hypothetical basis  assuming that all positions are held constant 
these exceptions are generally infrequent  as one would expect from the nature and definition of a var computation 
we evaluate our var methodology on an ongoing basis 
any revisions to our var methodology are implemented only after thorough review and approval internally and by the federal reserve  our primary us banking regulator 
we implemented one such revision in august  in order to better capture the risks associated with our exposures to certain interest rate spreads 
the following table presents the var associated with our trading activities  presented in the preceding table  and the var associated with positions outside of these trading activities  the latter of which is described as var for non trading assets 
total regulatory var is calculated as the sum of the var associated with trading assets and the var for non trading assets  with no additional diversification benefits recognized 
the average  maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately 
total regulatory value at risk year ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum var for trading assets var for non trading assets total regulatory var asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of the assets and liabilities carried in our consolidated statement of condition from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of client deposits generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
non us dollar denominated client liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated statement of condition 
this exposure and the resulting changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves are considered in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alcco 
our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir  global treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units  north america  europe and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 

table of contents our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
our use of derivatives is subject to alcco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on nir and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible nir results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates and economic value of equity  or eve  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on nir in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a view toward liquidation of state street 
both of these measures are subject to alcco approved guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests  by both global treasury and alcco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming our forecasted yield curve over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from borrowers prepayment opportunities 
key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our client liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely predict future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 

table of contents the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of the dates indicated  due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
net interest revenue at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions december  december  rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp as of december   nir sensitivity to an upward basis point shock in market rates increased compared to december  a larger projected balance sheet funded mainly with client deposit inflows is expected to increase the benefit of rising rates to nir 
the benefit to nir is less significant for an upward basis point ramp  since market rates are assumed to increase gradually 
nir is expected to be more sensitive to a downward basis point shock in market rates as of december  compared to december  due to the exceptionally low interest rate environment  deposit rates quickly reach their implicit floors and provide little funding relief on the liability side  while assets reset into the lower rate environment  placing downward pressure on nir 
other important factors which affect the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of the dates indicated  assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity in millions december  december  rate change bps shock bps shock exposure to eve for an upward basis point shock as of december  declined slightly compared to december  the impact of lower rates shortening the duration of the investment portfolio was offset by purchases of fixed rate investment securities in credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with underlying contractual terms 
we assume credit and counterparty risk for both our on and off balance sheet exposures 
the extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on each 
table of contents counterparty s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations 
we maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss 
state street s risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with management judgment 
qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner  and following a formal review and approval process  an internal credit rating based on state street s credit scale is assigned 
we evaluate the credit of our counterparties on an ongoing basis  but at a minimum annually 
significant exposures are reviewed daily by erm 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all extensions of credit 
as part of the approval and renewal process  due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
at any point in time  having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds of our consolidated total shareholders equity  exclusive of unrealized gains or losses  is not unusual 
we provide  on a selective basis  traditional loan products and services to key clients in a manner that is intended to enhance client relationships  increase profitability and manage risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based on credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date  this allowance is reviewed on a regular basis by management 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered appropriate relative to the level of estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
information about provisions for loan losses is included under provision for loan losses in this management s discussion and analysis 
we also assume other types of credit exposure with our clients and counterparties 
we purchase securities under reverse repurchase agreements  which are agreements to resell 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
risk is managed through a variety of processes  including establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases primarily to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of pledged assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is required from the borrower 
we also provide clients with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit and standby bond purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities  which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition 
management reviews the appropriate level of this reserve on a regular basis 
on behalf of clients enrolled in our securities lending program  we lend securities to banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled billion as of december   compared to billion as of december  we require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
state street holds the collateral received in connection with its securities lending services as agent  and these holdings are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
the securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
we held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan as of december  and  respectively 
the collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our clients 
in certain cases  the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements  for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested 
we 
table of contents require the counterparty to the repurchase agreement to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the amount of the repurchase agreement 
the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
of the collateral of billion as of december  and billion as of december  referenced above  billion as of december  and billion as of december  was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 
we or our agents held billion and billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements as of december  and  respectively 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and risk management 
procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  we provide a broad array of services  including research  investment management  trading services and investment servicing  that give rise to operational risk 
consequently  active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for its management 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in a consistent manner across state street 
responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
we maintain a governance structure related to operational risk designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
the risk and capital committee of the board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework 
erm develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program 
business units take responsibility for their own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls  which are designed to provide a sound operational environment 
the business units also identify  manage  and report on operational risk 
the operational risk committee reviews operational risk related information and policies  provides oversight of the operational risk program  and escalates operational risk issues of note to the mrac and risk and capital committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining audit committee of the board 
our discipline in managing operational risk  which is a result of this emphasis on policy  guidelines  oversight  and independent review  provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  interest rate  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and consequently the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of 
table of contents business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain clients and the associated revenue  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of our business  we use special purpose entities 
additional information about these special purpose entities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item one type of special purpose entity is used in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles 
since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles as defined by gaap  we do not record them in our consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of our business  we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our clients  and  in conformity with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about our securities finance activities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in the normal course of our business  we use derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
additional information about our use of derivative instruments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap  and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the majority of the accounting policies described in note do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements  interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting estimates 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining audit committee of the board 
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  including trading account assets  investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments 
as discussed in further detail below  changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income  or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition 
in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition  and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below 
at december   approximately billion of our financial assets and approximately billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the amounts at december  represented approximately of our consolidated total assets and approximately of our consolidated total liabilities  compared to and  respectively  at december  the decrease in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets at december  compared to mainly reflected the impact of a significant increase in interest bearing deposits with banks  in which we invested excess client deposits  partly offset by purchases of asset backed and other debt securities available for sale as part of our re investment strategy 
the significant increase in client deposits and our re investment strategy are more fully discussed under net interest revenue in consolidated results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis 
additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact  and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
when possible  we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical  or similar  financial assets or liabilities 
when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets  we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
in some instances  certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets  and as a result we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value 
we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based on a prescribed three level valuation hierarchy 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level 
at december   including the effect of master netting agreements  we categorized approximately of our financial assets carried at fair value in level  with the remaining categorized in levels and of the fair value hierarchy 
at december   on the same basis  we categorized approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level  with the remaining categorized in levels and the assets categorized in level were composed of trading account assets and us treasury securities available for sale  specifically treasury bills  which have a maturity of one year or less 
fair value for these securities was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 

table of contents the assets categorized in level were composed of investment securities available for sale and derivative instruments 
fair value for the investment securities was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties 
information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process 
management utilizes a process to verify the information provided  including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions 
in addition  management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information 
such information may include known trades or  to the extent that trading activity is limited  comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations  execution prices and the timing of cash flows  and where information is available  back testing 
the derivative instruments categorized in level predominantly represented foreign exchange and interest rate contracts used in our trading activities  for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques  with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points  as well as observable interest rate curves 
the substantial majority of our financial assets categorized in level were composed of asset backed and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
level assets also included derivative instruments  mainly foreign exchange contracts 
the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level as of december  compared to increased approximately  primarily composed of purchases of us and us asset backed securities in connection with our above described re investment strategy 
with respect to derivative instruments  we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit 
we considered factors such as the market based probability of default by us and our counterparties  our current and expected potential future net exposures by remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value 
valuation adjustments associated with derivative instruments were not significant for  or interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment our portfolio of fixed income investment securities constitutes a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated statement of condition 
as discussed below  the estimation of future cash flows from these securities is a significant factor in the recognition of both interest revenue and other than temporary impairment with respect to these securities 
expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows 
in determining these estimates  management relies on relevant and reliable information  including but not limited to deal structure  including optional and mandatory calls  market interest rate curves  industry standard asset class specific prepayment models  recent prepayment history  independent credit ratings  and recent actual and projected credit losses 
management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates 
management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly 
additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided under financial condition investment securities in this management s discussion and analysis 
interest revenue recognition our investment portfolio  excluding the former conduit assets remaining from the consolidation  consists of securities which were not typically acquired at significant discounts or premiums to their face amounts 
in connection with the conduit consolidation  we recorded certain of the conduits investment securities at a significant discount to their face amount 
to the extent that future cash flows from these securities exceed their recorded carrying amounts as expected  the portion of the discount not related to credit will be accreted into interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income over the securities remaining terms 
as a result of the magnitude of the discount  the estimates associated with the timing and amount of the accretion of these security discounts into interest revenue are significant to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents a portion of the former conduit securities  primarily asset backed securities  had expected credit losses on the date of consolidation  or were considered to be certain beneficial interests in a securitization that were not of high credit quality  and therefore  we account for these securities  including the recognition of related interest revenue  differently from the remainder of our portfolio 
the accounting for these securities requires an initial estimation of the timing and amount of each of the securities expected future principal  interest and other contractual cash flows  and the calculation of a yield based on these estimates  which yield is maintained and used to recognize interest revenue 
generally  the timing and amount of these securities future cash flows are inherently uncertain  due to the unknown timing and amount of principal payments including potential credit losses and the variability of future interest rates 
since the conduit consolidation  we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income of billion  composed of million in  million in and million in we recorded significantly less accretion in as a result of the december investment portfolio repositioning  and we similarly expect to record significantly less accretion in future years 
additional information about this discount accretion is provided under consolidated results of operations total revenue net interest revenue in this management s discussion and analysis 
other than temporary impairment gaap also requires the use of cash flow estimates to evaluate other than temporary impairment of our investment securities 
the amount and timing of expected future cash flows are significant estimates in the determination of other than temporary impairment 
additional information with respect to management s assessment of other than temporary impairment is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value 
goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  and both goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount 
in conformity with gaap  we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business  with the remainder associated with our investment management line of business 
goodwill is ultimately supported by revenue from our investment servicing and investment management businesses 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major lines of business 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the 
table of contents reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies a market approach  based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  or an income approach  based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future 
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate 
additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets  including information by line of business  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in indicated that there was no significant impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in there was no significant impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets in  and no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets was recorded in goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at december  totaled approximately billion and billion  respectively  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  recent accounting developments information with respect to recent accounting developments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item item a
