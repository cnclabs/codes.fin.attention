the company s consolidated global tax rate has declined as zebra s business continued to expand more rapidly in international regions that have lower tax rates 
critical accounting policies and estimates management prepared the consolidated financial statements of zebra under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions we used are reasonable  based upon the information available 
our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in our financial statements 
the following accounting policies comprise those that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating zebra s reported financial results 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized once four criteria are met we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exits  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  which happens at the point of shipment except in asia where the terms are fob destination provided that no significant obligations remain  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
other items that affect our revenue recognition include customer returns customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  but zebra cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience return rates consistent with 
table of contents historical patterns 
historically  our product returns have not been significant 
however  if a significant issue should arise  it could have a material impact on our financial statements 
growth rebates some of our channel program partners are offered incentive rebates based on the attainment of specific growth targets related to products they purchase from us over a quarter or year 
these rebates are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
each quarter  we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and establish a reserve for them based on shipment history 
historically  actual rebates have been in line with our estimates 
price protection some of our customers are offered price protection by zebra as an incentive to carry inventory of our product 
these price protection plans provide that if we lower prices  we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold 
we estimate future payments under price protection programs quarterly and establish a reserve  which is charged against revenue 
our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory  and zebra infrequently lowers prices on current products 
as a result  the amounts paid under these plans have been minimal 
software revenue we sell four types of software and record revenue as follows our printers contain embedded firmware  which is part of the hardware purchase 
we consider the sale of this firmware to be incidental to the sale of the printer and do not attribute any revenue to it 
we sell a limited amount of prepackaged  or off the shelf  software for the creation of bar code labels using our printers 
there is no customization required to use this software  and we have no post shipment obligations on the software 
revenue is recognized at the time this prepackaged software is shipped 
we sometimes provide custom software as part of a printer installation project 
we bill custom software development services separate from the related hardware 
revenue related to custom software is recognized once the custom software development services have been completed and accepted by the customer 
we recognize license revenue under asc accounting standards codification  when a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
maintenance and support agreements we enter into post contract maintenance and support agreements 
revenues are recognized ratably over the service period and the cost of providing these services is expensed as incurred 
shipping and handling we charge our customers for shipping and handling services based upon our internal price list for these items 
the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships 
any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales 
zebra enters into sales transactions that include more than one product type 
this bundle of products might include printers  current or future supplies  and services 
when this type of transaction occurs  we allocate the purchase price to each product type based on the fair value of the individual products determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
the revenue for each individual product is then recognized when the recognition criteria for that product is fully met 
investments and marketable securities investments and marketable securities at december   consisted of the following us government and agency securities obligations of government sponsored enterprises state and municipal bonds corporate securities includes investments in notes issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation  the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan bank 
we classify our debt and marketable equity securities in one of three categories trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
held to 
table of contents maturity securities are those debt securities that zebra has the ability and intent to hold until maturity 
all securities not included in trading or held to maturity are classified as available for sale 
trading and available for sale securities are recorded at fair value 
held to maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost  adjusted for the amortization or accretion of discounts or premiums 
unrealized holding gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
as of december   zebra s investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available for sale 
in addition  as of december   all of our investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than one year are classified as long term investments on the balance sheet due to our ability and intent to hold them until maturity 
accounts receivable we have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts  including credit reviews of all new customer accounts  ongoing credit evaluations of current customers  credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information  adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  an active collection effort by regional credit functions  reporting directly to the corporate financial officers  and limited credit insurance on the majority of our international revenues 
we reserve for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
over the last three years  accounts receivable reserves varied from to of total accounts receivable 
accounts receivable reserves as of december   were  or of the balance due 
we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quality of the portfolio as of december  while credit losses have historically been within expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture using the first in  first out fifo method  or the current estimated market value 
we review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve months 
over the last three years  our inventory reserves have ranged from to of gross inventory 
as of december   inventory reserves were  or of gross inventory 
we believe this reserve level is appropriate considering the quantities and quality of the inventories as of december  valuation of goodwill we test the impairment of goodwill each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual assessment during june and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of the end of may during the first quarter of  we announced an agreement to sell navis and our decision to divest certain other operations 
these operations constituted a portion of our zebra enterprise solutions zes segment  which was also deemed to be the reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
as a result of our decision to sell navis  goodwill attributable to the zes segment was allocated to the three businesses that constituted the prior reporting unit based on the relative fair value of those businesses 
goodwill was allocated between continuing operations  and discontinued operations  based on the relative fair value of each of the businesses 
the goodwill allocated above to continuing operations was tested for impairment and we determined that our goodwill related to this reporting unit was not impaired 
beginning with the first quarter of  the continuing operations of the former zes reporting unit have been combined with the former specialty printing group spg operating segment to form one zebra operating segment 

table of contents goodwill of a reporting unit should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  testing for recoverability under asc of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statement of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit  or allocation of a portion of goodwill to a business to be disposed of 
if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred  we perform an impairment test 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using three valuation methods income approach discounted cash flow analysis  market approach guideline public company method  and market approach comparative transactions method 
the approach defined below is based upon our last impairment test conducted in june as of the end of may under the income approach discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions consider sales  cost of sales and operating expenses projected through the year these assumptions were determined by management utilizing our internal operating plan and assuming growth rates for revenues and operating expenses  and margin assumptions 
the fourth key assumption under this approach is the discount rate which is determined by looking at current risk free rates of capital  current market interest rates and the evaluation of risk premium relevant to the business segment 
if our assumptions relative to growth rates were to change or were incorrect  our fair value calculation may change which could result in impairment 
the company s risk factors are discussed under item a of this form k 
under the market approach guideline company method we identified five publicly traded companies  including zebra  which we believe have significant relevant similarities 
for these five companies we calculated the mean ratio of invested capital to revenues and invested capital to ebitda 
similar to the income approach discussed above  sales  cost of sales  operating expenses and their respective growth rates were the key assumptions utilized 
the market prices of zebra and other guideline company shares are key assumptions 
if these market prices increase  the estimated market value would increase 
if the market prices decrease  the estimated market value would decrease 
under the market approach comparative transactions method we looked at eight market based transactions for companies that have similarities to our business segment  including similarities to one or more of the business lines  markets  growth prospects  margins and size 
we calculated mean revenue and ebitda multiples for the selected transactions 
these multiples were applied to forecasted zebra results for that segment to estimate market value 
the key assumptions and impact to changes to those assumptions would be similar to those assumptions under the income approach discounted cash flow analysis and the market approach guideline company method 
the results of these three methods are weighted based upon managements determination with more weight attached to the income approach because it considers anticipated future financial performance 
the market approaches are based upon historical and current economic conditions which might not reflect the long term prospects or opportunities for our business segment being evaluated 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 

table of contents valuation of long lived and other intangible assets we evaluate the impairment of identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered that may trigger an impairment review consist of significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in zebra s stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we believe that one or more of the above indicators of impairment have occurred and the undiscounted cash flow test has failed in the case of amortizable assets  we measure impairment based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates the risk inherent in the cash flows 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to  as of december  income taxes on january   we adopted asc according to asc  we identified  evaluated  and measured the amount of income tax benefits to be recognized for all of our income tax positions 
during  we recognized an increase of approximately  in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to an acquisition 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows in thousands balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to additions based on tax positions related to additions based on tax positions related to additions based on tax positions related to balance at december  zebra s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as part of income tax expense 
for the years ended december  and december   we did not accrue any interest or penalties into income tax expense 
zebra is currently under us federal income tax audits for years of and the tax years through remain open to examination by multiple state taxing jurisdictions 
tax authorities in the united kingdom have completed income tax audits for tax years through included in deferred tax assets are amounts related to federal and state net operating losses that resulted from our acquisition of wherenet corp 
as of december   we had approximately  of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in through as of december   we also had approximately  of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in through zebra s intention is to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax expense 
under the united states tax reform act of  the amounts of benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
in addition  as of december  zebra had approximately  of foreign net operating loss carryforwards which currently can be carried forward indefinitely 
year ended december  december  effective tax rate 
table of contents zebra s effective tax rate for the first quarter of included a  reduction of federal taxes related to improperly accounting for the tax impact on intercompany profit generated from intercompany sales in this adjustment reduced our effective rate for by approximately 
zebra s effective tax rate decreased in due primarily to higher profits in lower rate international jurisdictions 
contingencies we record estimated liabilities related to contingencies based on our estimates of the probable outcomes 
quarterly  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation  tax audits and other contingencies and confirm or revise estimates and reserves as appropriate 
for further information regarding material pending legal proceedings  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k 
equity based compensation as of december   zebra had an active equity based compensation plan and a stock purchase plan available for future grants

zebra earns a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
zebra does not currently foresee a need to repatriate funds  however  should zebra require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally  zebra could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense
