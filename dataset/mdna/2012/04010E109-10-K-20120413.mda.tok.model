overview and outlook for the year ended january   the consolidated net revenues of continuing operations were million which represented a decrease of million from the net revenues of continuing operations of million for the prior year 
income from continuing operations for the year ended january  was approximately million  or per diluted share 
income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  net income for the year ended january  attributable to our stockholders was approximately million  or per diluted share 
we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  the reduction in consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended january   compared with the net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended january   was due primarily to a decrease of in the net revenues of the power industry services business  which represented of consolidated net revenues for the year ended january  the net revenues of the telecommunications infrastructure services business for the year ended january  increased by  to million for the current year compared with net revenues of approximately million for the year ended january  the financial results for the year ended january  reflect the transition for us between major projects 
in the period december to july  we substantially completed three energy plant construction projects that sustained us through the year ended january  substantial work on new projects did not commence until the latter half of the year ended january  as a result  the net revenues of our power industry services business for the year ended january  were adversely impacted  particularly during the first two quarters 
during the first quarter  we completed the construction of a gas fired power plant in northern california  this major project represented our most significant construction activity for the previous two fiscal years 
during the second quarter  we substantially completed construction of the gas fired peaking plant in connecticut 
in addition  construction activity on a wind energy farm project was completed late in the fiscal year ended january  in total  these three projects provided approximately of consolidated net revenues of continuing operations for the year ended january  as of january   the value of our construction contract backlog was million compared with a backlog value of million as of january   including over million related to a project awarded to us in october for the engineering and construction of a megawatt biomass fired power plant in east texas 
although we do not expect to receive a full notice to proceed on this contract from the project owner until the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year  we have begun critical planning and early engineering activities on this project 
completion of this project is expected to occur in december the current backlog also includes two other projects  the design and construction of a gas fired electricity peaking facility in southern california and a wind energy farm in illinois 
we substantially commenced the construction activities on the illinois wind farm in the second quarter  including the installation of up to one hundred thirty four wind turbines with a total power rating of approximately megawatts 
this contract was awarded to us last november with a planned project completion date in late calendar in may  we received the anticipated full notice to proceed from the project owner in southern california pursuant to which we immediately commenced activity for the design and construction of an mw  eight unit simple cycle peaking power plant near desert hot springs  california 
this project is scheduled to be completed during the summer of calendar year together  these two projects represented approximately of net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended january  in the most recent fourth fiscal quarter  we announced that gps  through its wholly owned subsidiary  gemma renewable power  llc grp  had signed an epc contract with a solar power project development firm for the design and build of a solar energy facility located on a closed capped landfill in canton  massachusetts 
grp has received a full release to start all engineering and construction activities on this project that is expected to be completed during the summer of calendar the award of this project increased backlog by approximately million 
late in the year ended january   we were also awarded another wind energy project  located in pennsylvania  with a contract value of approximately million 
primarily due to the decrease in net revenues from continuing operations  gross profit declined by approximately million between years 
however  our overall gross profit percentage was maintained at a consistent level for both years 
we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by  or approximately  for the year ended january  compared with the comparable expense amount for the prior year 
as a result  income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended january  declined by approximately million  to million from million for the year ended january  cash and cash equivalents increased during the current year by over million to approximately million at january  due primarily to net cash provided by the operating activities of continuing operations 
current economic conditions in the united states reflect ongoing weakness in employment  housing and many other industry sectors 
stubbornly high unemployment  the depressed state of the housing industry  reduced state and local government budgets and sluggish manufacturing activity have all contributed significantly to a reduction in construction spending in the united states 
affecting us more specifically  these factors have resulted in lower demand for electricity which in turn has resulted in power plant operators experiencing less urgency to build new electricity generating power plants 
in addition  the significant instability in the financial markets may be continuing to make it difficult for certain of our customers  particularly for projects funded by private investment  to access the credit markets to obtain financing for new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
the sharp reduction in the number of new commercial  industrial and infrastructure construction projects has created an extremely competitive bid environment in our construction sector 
many known competitors have reduced prices  willing to sacrifice margin in order to keep work crews busy 
other construction companies have entered our sector of the industry looking for new work at low margins 
the power industry has not fully recovered from the recessionary decline in the demand for power in the united states 
as it will likely take at least several years for power consumption to reach peak levels  existing power plants will continue to operate with spare capacity to produce electricity 
despite the reductions in the demand for power  certain regions of the country continued to add power generation facilities over the last several years  wind energy facilities in particular 
the combination of these new electricity generation plants and excess power generation capacity elsewhere may obviate the need to build power plants during the power demand recovery period 
the expected increase in momentum towards more environmentally friendly power generation facilities has not occurred at the pace expected just a few years ago 
the federal government has failed to pass comprehensive energy legislation  including incentives or mandates for the retirement of existing coal burning power plants and caps on the volume of carbon emissions 
at present  there is no bipartisan agreement regarding the approval of government incentives for sources of renewable power in either legislative house of congress 
with the future availability of renewable energy tax incentives unknown  potential energy project developers and investors may be hesitant to make commitments related to new renewable energy generation facilities 
although certain coal fired power plants have been shut down  existing coal plants are proving to be a challenge to retrofit or replace 
coal prices are widely considered to be stable and certain states see the availability of inexpensive  coal fired electricity as a key driver of economic growth 
we believe that it is likely that this unfavorable energy construction environment will continue to limit the number of new energy plant construction opportunities through our fiscal year ending january  in addition  we expect that the new opportunities which do arise will result in fierce competition among bidders 
however  we continue to believe that the long term prospects for energy plant construction are extremely favorable 
we expect that the negative environmental impact of burning coal  political focus on energy independence and renewed concerns about the safety of nuclear power plants eventually will spur the development of renewable and cleaner gas fired power generation facilities which should result in new power facility construction opportunities for us in the future 
the demand for electrical power in this country is expected to recover and grow steadily over the long term 
this demand  and the expected retirement of old coal  nuclear and oil powered energy plants  should result in gas fired and renewable energy plants  like wind and biomass  representing the substantial majority of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix 
utilities and other power generating companies in our country have announced the retirement of aging  inefficient coal fired power plants and dropped future plans to build new ones 
we understand that calendar was the second straight year in which construction did not begin on a single new coal fired power plant in the united states 
new regulations regarding air pollution are being developed by states and the us environmental protection agency the epa 
for instance  in july  the epa finalized a new rule  which is designed to reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions into the atmosphere 
also  in march  the epa proposed standards for power plants intended to increase controls over mercury and other air pollutants 
although these measures are subject to a number of legal challenges  we believe they represent additional obstacles for coal fired power plants 
although our federal government has failed to enact national renewable energy standards  more than half of the states have adopted formal renewable energy portfolio standards which have contributed to an expansion of the wind energy industry 
since  wind energy farms have represented over of all new electricity generating capacity in the united states  second only to natural gas and more than coal and nuclear combined 
further  there is federal support for improving the power infrastructure  for example the streamlining of power transmission line permitting and the modernization of the power grid  which is essential for the growth of intermittent power generation sources like wind and solar 
during the year ended january   we began construction of a new megawatt wind energy farm in illinois 
we continue to observe interest in gas fired generation as electric utilities and independent power producers look to diversify their power generation options 
we believe that the initiatives in many states to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases  and the desire by utilities to fill demand for additional power prior to the completion of more sizeable  expensive or controversial projects  will stimulate and sustain demand for more efficient gas fired power plants 
natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel  emitting fewer pollutants into the atmosphere 
in addition  gas fired generation of electricity can complement wind  solar and other alternative generation facilities because gas fired facilities can be brought on line quickly to smooth the inherently variable generation pattern of these alternative energy sources 
we would also expect power producers to increase future capital spending on gas fired power plants to take advantage of recent lower natural gas prices and the prospect that these prices may remain stable for some time because of the rapidly expanding supply of natural gas coming from shale gas field development projects in the united states 
while it is unclear what the future impact of economic conditions might have on the timing or financing of future projects  we expect that gas fired power plants will continue to be an important component of long term power generation development in the united states and believe our capabilities and expertise will position us as a market leader for these projects 
the completed projects in northern california and connecticut  and the southern california peaking plant project  all utilize gas fired electricity generation 
during this difficult time for our industry  we are focused on the effective and efficient completion of our current construction projects and the control of costs  which we expect to result in higher net revenues and favorable profit results for our fiscal year ending january  despite the intensely competitive business environment  we are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects 
this approach may result in a lower volume of new business bookings until the demand for new power generation facilities and the other construction industry sectors recover fully 
we will strive to conserve cash and to maintain an overall strong balance sheet 
however  we are seeing new business opportunities that include an opportunity to make an investment in the ownership of a new project  at least during the development phase of the project  in order to improve the probability of an epc contract award see note to the consolidated financial statements 
because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet  we are willing to consider the opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks 
alternatively  in order to be considered for large opportunities in the future  project owners may require us to team with a larger construction firm partner in order to reduce the perceived performance risk 
this type of arrangement may also be acceptable to us in certain circumstances 
although the uncertain economic conditions do impair our forecasting visibility to an unusual degree  we remain cautiously optimistic about our long term growth opportunities 
we are focused on expanding our position in the growing power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of increasing electricity demand covering decades into the future 
we believe that our expectations are reasonable and that our future plans are based on reasonable assumptions 
moxie energy projects as is common in our industry  general construction contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures  limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a project owner such as a government agency or a commercial enterprise 
these teaming arrangements are generally dissolved upon completion of the project or program 
in november  gemma power  inc gpi  an affiliate of gps that is wholly owned by us agreed to the amendment of a development agreement with moxie energy  llc moxie which was executed earlier in the year ended january   and which has provided gpi with an opportunity to support the initial development of two power plant projects with loans and the option to provide additional development loans and or equity investments to cover the anticipated costs of the developments 
moxie has two natural gas fired power plant projects under development located in the marcellus shale gas region of pennsylvania 
the strategy of moxie is to develop these power plants the moxie projects near the natural gas source and to provide transmitted electricity to the power grid in the northeastern united states  eliminating the need to transport natural gas via pipeline from well to power production plant 
as of january   gpi had provided approximately million in cash to the moxie projects under short term initial development loans scheduled to be repaid during the fiscal year ending january  an additional  of loans was authorized by us for the moxie projects at year end 
moxie has supported the arrangement by providing gpi with a series of liens  security interests  guarantees and development fee preferences see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements which  together with the loans  provide us with substantial financial control over the moxie projects 
in return for gpi s providing the initial development loans described above  moxie will provide gpi with the right to provide construction services for the two projects under epc contracts 
we have evaluated the moxie projects to be variable interest entities under current accounting guidance vies 
despite not having an ownership interest in the moxie projects  we have concluded that gpi is currently the primary beneficiary of these vies due primarily to the significance of gpi s loans to the entities  the risk that gpi could absorb significant losses if the development projects are not successful  the opportunity for gpi to receive development success fees and the possibility of gpi obtaining two large epc contracts for the construction of the power plants 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and financial results of the moxie projects are included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended january  to date  the activities of the moxie projects have been focused on securing the necessary permits to build and operate the power plants and to transmit the electricity produced there to users  obtaining financing for the remaining costs of development  completing an electricity supply agreement with a customer and engaging energy plant operators in negotiations for the purchase of the projects 
the completion of negotiations and agreements that would assure our construction of the power plants may not occur until the latter half of the fiscal year ending january  in the event that successful continuation and or completion of the planned development of the moxie projects would not occur  we may not receive repayment of current and future loans which could result in a write off of the balance of the loans that may be significant to a future reporting period 
discontinued operations on march   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of vitarich laboratories  inc vli  a wholly owned subsidiary that represented our nutritional products business  to nbty florida  inc nbty 
the asset sale was consummated for an aggregate cash purchase price of up to  and the assumption by the purchaser of certain trade payables  accrued expenses and remaining obligations under vli s facility leases 
of the cash purchase price   was paid at closing and the remaining  was placed into escrow 
subsequently  vli was paid approximately  cash from the escrow amount as purchased inventory was used in production by nbty and purchased accounts receivable balances were collected 
amounts received from the escrow account were recorded as sale proceeds upon receipt 
in december and pursuant to the terms of the asset sale agreement  the funds remaining in the escrow account were returned to nbty 
the financial results for vli have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income associated with discontinued operations for the year ended january  was approximately  including net gain on the sale of assets  before income taxes  in the amount of  and approximately  in income tax benefit related to the deduction  for income tax return purposes  for the worthless stock of vli 
these favorable amounts were offset partially by costs of operations incurred prior to the sale of assets and those related to the legal matter discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we incurred a loss from discontinued operations for the year ended january  in the approximate amount of million 
due to the cash proceeds received from the sale of assets  net cash provided by the discontinued activities of vli for the year ended january  was approximately million 
for the year ended january   discontinued operations used million in cash 
the assets and liabilities of vli as of january  were classified as held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended january  and the following schedule compares the results of our continuing operations for the years ended january  and except where noted  the percentage amounts represent the percentage of net revenues for the corresponding year 
as analyzed below the schedule  we reported net income attributable to our stockholders of approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   we reported a comparable net income amount of million 
net revenues power industry services telecommunications infrastructure services net revenues cost of revenues power industry services telecommunications infrastructure services cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations net income attributable to stockholders less than 
the cost of revenues percentage amounts represents the percentage of net revenues of the applicable segment 
net revenues power industry services for the year ended january   the net revenues related to two new projects represented approximately and of the net revenues of the segment  respectively  and approximately and of consolidated net revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
these projects include the sentinel project in southern california and the wind energy project located in illinois 
for the year ended january   substantially all of the net revenues of this segment were associated with three projects that have been completed 
for the year ended january   these completed projects represented only of the net revenues of this segment 
most significantly  the operating results for the year ended january  reflected the final activity on this segment s major project for the previous three years  a gas fired power plant located in northern california  which was completed during the first quarter 
for the year ended january   the net revenues related to this project represented and of segment net revenues and consolidated net revenues from continuing operations  respectively 
in addition  during the year ended january   we completed construction of a power plant in connecticut that contributed net revenues which represented and of this segment s net revenues for the years ended january  and  respectively 
as a result  the net revenues of this business declined by to million for the current year compared with net revenues in the amount of million for the year ended january  however  at year end  this segment had six active projects and  as described above  construction contract backlog of million 
telecommunications infrastructure services during the year ended january   the net revenues of the telecommunications services business of smc increased by to million compared with net revenues in the amount of million for the prior year 
the net revenues of the telecommunications infrastructure services business  expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenues from continuing operations  also increased to for the current period compared with for the year ended january  the increases were primarily due to the net revenues earned pursuant to the new contract arrangement with howard county  maryland  which represented approximately of the net revenues of smc for the year ended january  smc was also effective in increasing the amount net revenues earned pursuant to bid business awarded by a variety of other new customers by approximately during the year ended january  this business represented of smc s net revenues for the year ended january  conversely  net revenues related to the performance of inside premises activities for smc s most significant prior year customer declined from approximately of this segment s net revenues for the year ended january  to less than of net revenues for the year ended january  our customer had a prime contract with the federal government that expired during the year ended january   adversely affecting the number and amount of subcontracted projects awarded to us in the subsequent year 
cost of revenues due substantially to the decline in consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended january  compared with the year ended january   the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also declined 
these costs were million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
however  the overall gross profit percentage was maintained during the year ended january  compared with previous year at approximately of corresponding consolidated net revenues from continuing operations 
the gross profit percentage achieved by gps for the years ended january  and was also maintained at  substantially due to the recognition during the year ended january  of net revenues related to final change orders and contract cost close out adjustments associated with the completion of major construction projects 
smc was successful in improving the profitability of most elements of its business  its gross profit percentage was for the year ended january  compared with for the year ended january   which reflected losses recognized on two projects that totaled approximately  in the earlier year 
selling  general and administrative expenses these costs decreased by  or  to approximately million for the year ended january  from approximately million for the year ended january   reflecting decreases between years in stock compensation expense and cash bonus expense of  and  respectively  and the addition of approximately  in costs incurred by the moxie projects 
the amounts for these accounts for the year ended january   included substantial stock compensation expense related to stock options awarded to two new senior executives and bonuses earned by employees of gps in connection with the completion of the gas fired power plant in northern california 
income tax expense for the year ended january   we incurred income tax expense related to continuing operations in the amount of million representing an annual effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the expected federal income tax rate of due primarily to state income taxes offset partially by favorable income tax effects of permanent differences  including  related to the domestic manufacturing deduction 
for the year ended january   we incurred income tax expense related to continuing operations of million which reflected an annual effective income tax rate of that differed from the expected federal income tax rate of due primarily to the unfavorable effects of state income taxes and income tax return to provision true up adjustments in the approximate amount of  liquidity and capital resources as of january  the balance of cash and cash equivalents increased during the current year to a balance of million as of january  compared with a balance of million as of january  despite profitable operations  consolidated working capital increased only slightly during the current year to million as of january  from approximately million as of january  due to the use of funds to pay a cash dividend in the amount of million to stockholders in november we have an available balance of million under our revolving line of credit financing arrangement with bank of america the bank that expires in may net cash of million was provided by the operating activities of continuing operations during the year ended january  income from continuing operations for the year ended january  was million 
we also received payments on new projects during the year ended january  to cover outstanding accounts payable and equipment purchases  which resulted in a million temporary increase in the amount of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings during the year 
the increasing construction activity associated with new projects also caused the amounts of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings to increase during the year ended january   representing uses of cash in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
on the other hand  the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related primarily to the new construction activity provided net cash during the year ended january  in the amount of million 
in addition  the completion of the construction project in northern california resulted in the release of restrictions on the cash balance segregated for this project providing cash in the amount of million during the year ended january  the amount of non cash adjustments to income from continuing operations for the year ended january  represented a net source of cash of approximately  including primarily stock compensation  depreciation and amortization expense amounts of   and  respectively 
the balance of prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by million during the year ended january  as net cash was used to make advance payments on certain expenditures associated with the gas fired power plant construction project in southern california and to prepay certain annual insurance premiums 
net cash of  was used by the operating activities of discontinued operations during the year ended january  for the year ended january   net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million 
we reported income from continuing operations of approximately million last year 
the amount of non cash adjustments to income from continuing operations last year represented a net source of cash of approximately million  including stock compensation expense of  amortization and depreciation of  and deferred income tax expense of  during the prior year  accounts receivable increased  representing a million use of cash as construction activity increased for the gas fired power peaking facility that was under construction in connecticut 
however  the allowable billings on this project included amounts covering forecasted short term costs resulting in an increase during the prior year in billings in excess of actual costs and estimated earnings as well 
this increase represents a source of cash in the amount of million 
the decrease in construction activity on the gas fired power plant located in northern california was the primary cause for the decreases in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings and accounts payable and accrued expenses which represented net cash amounts of million and million provided by and used in operating activities during the prior year  respectively 
last year  we also reduced the amount of cash subject to restrictions  providing net cash in the amount of million 
despite the use of cash by the discontinued operations of vli in the amount of million during the year ended january   net cash provided by operations was million last year 
during the year ended january   net cash was provided by investing activities in the amount of  due primarily to the receipt of cash proceeds from the sale of the assets of vli offset partially by expenditures for property and equipment  including  made by the moxie projects 
the exercise of stock options and warrants provided net cash proceeds from financing activities in the aggregate amount of approximately  during the year ended january  during the year ended january   we used net cash in connection with financing and investing activities in the amounts of  and  respectively  due primarily to principal payments made during the year to retire our remaining term note with the bank totaling  and the net purchases of property plant and equipment by continuing operations in the amount of we have pledged the majority of the company s assets to secure the financing arrangement 
under the financing arrangement with the bank  its consent is required for acquisitions and divestitures 
the amended financing arrangement contains an acceleration clause which allows the bank to declare amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements due and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has occurred in the financial condition of any of our companies 
the bank arrangement also requires the measurement of certain financial covenants at our fiscal year end and at each of our fiscal quarter ends using a rolling month period  determined on a consolidated basis  including requirements that the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceed to  that the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceed to  and that the fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than to at january  and january   we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants 
we believe that the company will continue to comply with its financial covenants under the financing arrangement 
if the company s performance results in our noncompliance with any of the financial covenants  or if the bank seeks to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above  we would seek to modify the financing arrangement  but there can be no assurance that the bank would not exercise its rights and remedies under the financing arrangement including accelerating payment of all outstanding senior debt due and payable 
during the year ended january   we did receive the required consents from the bank in order to complete the disposition of substantially all of the assets of vli and to declare the cash dividend paid to stockholders in november in may  we reached agreement with the bank on a new amendment to the financing arrangement which extended the expiration date of the revolving line of credit to may  and permits investments or loans  as described in the amendment  in amounts not to exceed million under certain conditions 
at january   most of the balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in a money market fund without any exposure to european sovereign bonds and sponsored by an investment division of the bank 
our operating and restricted bank accounts are maintained with the bank 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from our future operations and funds available under our line of credit will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future without deterioration of working capital 
any future acquisitions  or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement  may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  significant dilution to the existing stockholders may result 
off balance sheet arrangements we maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
we provide guarantees related to our services or work 
if our services under a guaranteed project would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency  then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies 
when sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable  we would record such guarantee losses 
in the ordinary course of business  our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made 
each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation 
if necessary  we may obtain standby letters of credit from the bank in the ordinary course of business  not to exceed million 
the financial crisis associated with the recession has not disrupted our insurance or surety programs or limited our ability to access needed insurance or surety capacity 
we also have a line of credit committed by the bank in the amount of million for general purposes 
from time to time  we may arrange for bonding to be issued by our surety firm for the benefit of the owner of an energy project for which we are not providing construction services 
we collect fees from the provider of such services as consideration for the use of our bonding capacity 
as of january   the total amount of outstanding surety bonds issued under such arrangements was approximately million 
we earned approximately  in fees during the year ended january  in connection with such arrangements 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non gaap measurement we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure  the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions 
further  we believe that ebitda is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance 
as ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  the results of our operations presented in accordance with us gaap that are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our ebitda does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
the following table presents the determinations of ebitda for continuing operations for the years ended january  and income from continuing operations  as reported interest expense income tax expense amortization of purchased intangible assets depreciation and other amortization ebitda as we believe that our net cash flow from continuing operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with us gaap  the following table reconciles the amounts of ebitda for the applicable years  as presented above  to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows provided by used in continuing operating activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows ebitda current income tax expense interest expense non cash stock option compensation expense decrease in escrowed cash decrease in accounts receivable change related to the timing of scheduled billings increase decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities other  net net cash provided by continuing operations inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture  and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our costs and expenses  such as those for employee compensation and benefits and commodities used in construction projects  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long term construction contracts  the valuation of goodwill  other indefinite lived assets and long lived assets  the valuation of employee stock options  income tax reporting and the reporting of legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
a description of the company s significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  is included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended january  revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
the types of contracts may vary and include agreements under which net revenues are based on a fixed price or cost plus fee basis 
net revenues from cost plus fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned  measured using the cost to cost method 
components of fee based on our achievement of certain cost or schedule objectives are included when we believe it is probable that such amounts have been earned 
net revenues from fixed price construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant costs  including materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimate 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual net revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects or other significant unfavorable impacts on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined  without regard to the percentage of completion 
we review the estimate of total cost on each significant contract monthly 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by management s experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for the price associated with that scope change 
the costs associated with a scope change are expensed as incurred and included in the estimated amount of cost to complete the contract 
we recognize net revenue on an unapproved change order when realization of price approval is probable 
as of january   unapproved change orders in the aggregate amount of approximately  were included in the total contract value amounts and reflected in the estimated total cost amounts of the corresponding contracts 
disputed change orders that are unapproved in regard to both scope and price are considered claims 
the company recognizes net revenues from a claim only when an agreement on the amount of the claim has been reached 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of gps and smc  we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names 
other than goodwill  most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives 
at january   the total carrying value of goodwill and the remaining purchased intangible asset with an indefinite life totaled approximately million  which represented approximately of consolidated total assets 
this amount included million in goodwill related to the acquisition of gps 
the company has reviewed for impairment  at least annually  the carrying values of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life 
the annual review performance date is november we also perform tests for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset value might be impaired 
as prescribed by current accounting guidance  we determine whether goodwill has been impaired or not using a two step process of analysis 
the first step of our goodwill impairment testing process is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the determination of the fair value of gps as of november  a variety of alternative valuation approaches were considered 
as a result of the analysis  we concluded that the market multiple and the discounted cash flow analysis approaches were the most appropriate valuation techniques for this exercise 
for the market multiple valuation  a fair value estimate for gps was determined based on an evaluation of the market values of a selected number of reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
a separate estimate was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
projected cash flows for gps were developed based on its historical financial performance  a short term projection of operating results based on the existing backlog of current business and the assumed addition of certain identified future projects  and published projected growth rates for the power construction industry 
the projected cash flow amounts were discounted to present value based on rates of return which were determined considering prevalent rates of return  business risks for the industry and risks specifically related to gps 
a weighting was applied to the results of the market multiple valuation and the discounted cash flow analysis of fair value in order to arrive at an average amount considered the fair value of gps 
as a result of this valuation  we concluded that the fair value of the net assets of gps substantially exceeded its carrying amount 
therefore  the goodwill of gps was deemed not to be impaired  and the performance of step two of the impairment assessment process was not required 
using a discounted cash flow analysis  we determined that the fair value of our other indefinite live asset  the trade name of smc  exceeded the corresponding carrying value of  at november  in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update  testing goodwill for impairment asu  which is intended to simplify the two step goodwill impairment test required by current guidance 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting entity unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance includes discussions of the types of factors which should be considered in conducting the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic  industry  market and entity specific factors 
although early adoption is permitted  we elected to conduct our assessment of goodwill as of november  in accordance with the testing requirements of the guidance before amendment 
however  in the future we may elect to perform qualitative evaluations of gps in order to support the position that impairment of the goodwill of gps has not occurred and that its fair value continues to exceed its carrying value  thus avoiding the performance of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for gps 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of equipment used in our operations 
fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to twenty years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of certain long lived assets is evaluated periodically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances such as poor operating results of the applicable business segment indicate that the asset s should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  including disposition  on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets  are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets to determine if an impairment exists 
if we identify a potential impairment  we will estimate the fair value of the assets through known market transactions of similar equipment and other valuation techniques  which could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
we will record a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair value 
deferred tax assets as of january  and  our consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax assets in the total amounts of  and  respectively  resulting from our future deductible temporary differences 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
at this time  we believe that the historically strong earnings performance of our power industry services business segment will continue during the periods in which the applicable temporary income tax differences become deductible 
accordingly  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
the amounts of income from operations before income taxes for this business segment were million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
stock options we measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards and recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods 
options to purchase  shares of our common stock were awarded during the year ended january  with a weighted average fair value per share amount of 
the amounts of compensation expense recorded during the years ended january  and related to vesting stock options were  and  respectively 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations which are disclosed in note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and include the risk free interest rate  the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of the stock option 
we use the simplified method in developing the estimates of the expected lives of stock options  as we believe that our historical stock option exercise experience is insufficient to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards 
legal contingencies as discussed in note to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in each case 
at this time  we do not believe that a material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed therein 
however  we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter 
we review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter  and make adjustments to the balances if necessary 
should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change  significant losses or additional costs may be recorded
