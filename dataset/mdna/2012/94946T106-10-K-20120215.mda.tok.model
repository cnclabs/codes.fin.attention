the impairment to our medicare reporting unit was due to  among other things  the anticipated operating environment resulting from regulatory changes and new health care legislation  and the resulting effects on our future membership trends 
in  we recorded goodwill impairment expense of million 
gain relates to the december  repurchase of all of the  tradable unsecured subordinated notes we issued on september  in connection with the stipulation and settlement agreement  which was approved in may  to resolve the putative class action complaints previously filed against us in thus  we recorded a gain on the repurchase of subordinated notes in the amount of million 
medical benefits ratio measures medical benefits expense as a percentage of premium revenue  excluding premium taxes 
as a result of the restatement and investigation  we were delayed in filing our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  the form k 
due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k  we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date of filing of our form k 
we determined that the claims information that had become available provided additional evidence about conditions that existed with respect to medical benefits payable at the december  balance sheet date and had been considered in accordance with gaap 
consequently  the amounts we recorded for medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense for the year ended december  were based on actual claims paid 
the difference between our actual claims paid for the period and the amount that would have resulted from using our original actuarially determined estimate is approximately million  or a decrease of in the mbr 
thus  medical benefits expense  medical benefits payable and the mbr for the year ended december  include the effect of using actual claims paid 
as discussed above  due to the delay in filing our form k  we were able to review substantially complete claims information that had become available due to the substantial lapse in time between december  and the date we filed our form k  therefore  the favorable development was reported in instead of as it otherwise would have been 
therefore  our recorded amounts for medical benefits expense and mbr for the year ended december  is approximately million  or  higher than it otherwise would have been if we had filed our form k on time

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with part ii  item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management s expectations 
factors that could cause such differences include those set forth under part i  item business and part i  item a risk factors  as well as forward looking statements discussed earlier in this form k 
overview executive summary we are a leading provider of managed care services to government sponsored health care programs  serving approximately million members nationwide 
we operate exclusively within the medicaid and medicare programs  serving the full spectrum of eligibility groups  with a focus on lower income beneficiaries 
our primary mission is to help our government customers deliver cost effective health care solutions  while improving health care quality and access for these programs 
we are committed to operating our business in a manner that serves our key constituents members  providers  government clients  and associates while delivering competitive returns for our investors 
business strategy our strategic priorities for include improving health care quality and access for our members  ensuring a competitive cost position and delivering prudent and profitable growth 
see part i  item business for a complete definition of our strategic priorities 
key developments and accomplishments presented below are key developments and accomplishments relating to progress on our strategic business priorities that occurred during and impacted our financial condition and results of operations 
effective during the fourth quarter of  we expanded into four new florida counties and are currently providing medicaid services to an additional  medicaid members 
as a result  we now serve counties in the state of florida and we are one of the largest medicaid plans in that state 
during the third quarter  the kentucky cabinet for health and family services awarded us a contract to serve kentucky s medicaid program in seven of kentucky s eight regions 
in november  we initially began serving approximately  beneficiaries across these seven regions 
subsequently  during the remainder of and in early  membership has increased to approximately  due to members opportunity to change plans 
our contract is for three years and may be extended for up to four one year extension periods upon mutual agreement of the parties 
under this new program  we coordinate medical  behavioral and dental health care for eligible kentucky medicaid beneficiaries in the tanf  chip and abd programs 
we currently are projecting the program will generate between million and million in premium revenue in in  our florida  georgia and missouri health plans received accreditation from nationally recognized  independent organizations that measure health plans commitment to high quality care  effective management  and accountability 
we remain dedicated to our long term target of attaining accreditation for all of our health plans 

table of contents another important aspect of our work on quality in was the finalization of our hedis measures for  which showed broad based improvement across our lines of business 
during the third quarter  we successfully completed an upgrade of our core operating systems 
this new technology will enable further progress in our work to improve service and productivity  and positions us to comply with future regulatory changes such as the implementation of icd the upgrade will also support our health care quality and access initiatives 
in  through continued organizational and process refinements  we achieved a basis point reduction in our sg a expense ratio  excluding investigation related litigation and other costs as defined in results of operations  summary of consolidated financial results  selling general and administrative expense 
administrative and medical cost initiatives remain an important discipline for us in light of the fiscal challenges of our state and federal customers 
for  we are anticipating a reduction in this ratio in the range of approximately to basis points 
additionally  as part of our medical expense initiatives  we have implemented provider contracting case and disease management initiatives which have contributed meaningfully to year over year reduction in the medicaid mbr and  in the case of ma  have moderated the year over year increase in mbr 
in august  we entered into a million senior secured credit agreement the credit agreement that can be used for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan facility as well as a million revolving credit facility 
both the term loan and revolving credit facility expire in august upon closing  we borrowed million pursuant to the term loan facility and million remained outstanding at december  this new credit agreement replaces our previous million credit agreement  which was never drawn upon 
our new credit agreement provides liquidity in support of the significant growth opportunities available to us 
in particular  additions to statutory capital may be needed for new markets  such as the new kentucky medicaid program  or markets experiencing significant growth 
for further information regarding the new credit agreement  refer to new credit agreement under liquidity and capital resources and in part iv  item c note debt 
general economic and political environment we expect the us congress to continue its close scrutiny of each component of the medicare program including medicare part d drug benefits and possibly seek to limit the private insurers role 
for example  the federal government may seek to negotiate drug prices for pdps and ma prescription drug plans  a function currently performed by plan sponsors 
we also expect state legislatures to continue to focus on the impact of health care reform and state budget deficits in many states are proposing or implementing strategies that will significantly change their current medicaid programs 
these changes include moving programs such as abd populations into managed care  expanding existing medicaid programs to provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured  re procurement of existing managed care programs and mandating minimum medical benefit ratios 
we cannot predict the outcome of any congressional oversight or any legislative activity  or predict what provisions legislation or regulation will contain in any state or what effect the legislation or regulation will have on our business operations or financial results  any of which could adversely affect us 
see part i  item business for a discussion of the current and political environment that is affecting our business 
health care reform we believe that the acts will bring about significant changes to the american health care system 
for further discussion of health care reform and its potential impact on our business  see part i  item business health care reform 
in addition  refer to the risks and uncertainties related to health care reform as discussed in part i  item a risk factors future changes in health care law present challenges for our business that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents business and financial outlook premium rates and payments the states in which we operate continue to experience fiscal challenges which have led to budget cuts and reductions in medicaid premiums in certain states or rate increases that are below medical costs trends 
in particular  we continue to experience pressure on rates in florida and georgia  two states from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenue 
our rates increased approximately in georgia effective july  in florida  changes that were effective september  had essentially no net impact on our overall rate 
the ultimate premium rate is based on program type  demographic mix and geographic location 
although premiums are generally contractually payable to us before or during the month in which we are obligated to provide services to our members  we have experienced delays in premium payments from certain states 
in particular  the state of georgia passed legislation in mandating that payment for medicaid premiums in that state be made in the middle and at the end of the month in which services are provided 
previously  such payments were made at the beginning of each month 
additionally  the georgia dch has recently informed us that it is delaying the payment of certain premiums for as much as million during the first quarter of  and plans to restore these payments during the second quarter of payments have already been delayed in january and february to date and if the delays continue through march as planned  our consolidated operating cash flow for the first quarter of will be materially impacted 
however  at this time  the delays are considered to be a timing issue and we have adequate liquidity to manage the delays 
we expect our programs in georgia and elsewhere will continue to operate as they have historically 
given the budget shortfalls in many states with which we contract  additional payment delays may occur in the future 
as part of the acts  ma payment benchmarks for were frozen at levels 
separately  cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of for beginning in  additional cuts to medicare advantage plans will take effect with the quartile system with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 
these changes could result in reduced reimbursement or payment levels 
this places increased importance on administrative cost improvements and effective medical expense initiatives 
market developments many states are proposing or implementing strategies that will significantly change their current medicaid programs 
these changes include moving programs into managed care  expanding existing programs to provide coverage to those who are currently uninsured  and reprocurement of existing managed care programs 
state budget shortfalls in many states will be a significant consideration in any changes to existing medicaid programs 
in december  the georgia dch amended its contracts for its medicaid programs  to provide for two additional one year option terms  exercisable by georgia dch  which potentially extends the total contract term until june  separately  georgia dch recently published a consultant s report evaluating alternatives for its medicaid program that includes a suggestion that the state should maintain the current program model  and also consider expanding it to include new populations  including the abd population  that may number as many as  individuals 
in january  hawaii s department of human services selected us to serve the state s quest medicaid program  which covers beneficiaries of hawaii s tanf and chip  as well as other eligible beneficiaries across hawaii 
this is an expansion of hawaii s medicaid program into managed care  where we currently serve approximately  abd beneficiaries 
we are one of five health plans selected to serve approximately quest  beneficiaries across the state 
beneficiaries of the quest program include low income individuals  families and children who are not aged  blind or disabled 
services are expected to begin on or about july   and we will coordinate medical  behavioral and pharmacy services with a focus on improving health care access and the quality of care 
with this new award  we become hawaii s only health plan to provide quest  quest expanded access and medicare advantage services across all six islands 
we are unable to estimate our expected additional membership at this time 
other states in which we have offered health plans for several years are expanding or reprocuring their medicaid managed care programs  which may be very complementary to our existing operations and infrastructure  including kansas  missouri and ohio 
in addition  we anticipate the managed long term care procurement by the florida medicaid program will occur in mid effective october   new york and ohio implemented changes to their administration of prescription drug coverage for their medicaid managed care enrollees 
pharmacy benefits that had been previously administered by the states will now be offered through health plans 
this change resulted in additional revenue of approximately million in and is expected to result in approximately million to million in additional revenue on an annual basis 
new york is also working toward the potential expansion of its managed long term care program 
we participate in this program today  which includes the opportunity to coordinate medicare and medicaid benefits for dual members 
in addition  new york is evaluating a number of alternatives for strengthening quality and cost management for its medicaid program 

table of contents effective january   we have expanded the geographic footprint of our ma plans by counties to a total of counties 
these expansions occurred within our existing states 
ma membership as of january  was approximately  an increase from  as of december  in addition  we now offer special needs plans for dually eligible beneficiaries in all of the markets we serve 
this expansion is consistent with our focus on the lower income demographic of the market and our ability over time to serve both the medicaid and medicare related coverage of these members 
based on the outcome of our stand alone pdp bids  our plans are below the benchmarks in five of the cms regions and within the de minimis range of the benchmark in other cms regions 
comparatively  in  our plans were below the benchmarks in regions and within the de minimis range in eight other regions 
we have retained our auto assigned members in those regions in which we bid within the de minimis range  however  we will not be auto assigned new members in those regions during consequently  membership has declined to approximately  as of january   a decrease from  as of december  the company anticipates pdp segment membership will decrease slightly during the remainder of due to normal attrition being offset by fewer new members as we will be auto assigned newly eligible members in in only the five regions where we are below the benchmark 
we believe our plans are well positioned relative to member utilization patterns  cost sharing  and a focus on generic medications 
consequently  we believe our pdps remain attractive to choosers  who comprise more than fifty percent of our current membership 
our revenues and medical benefits expenses for fiscal years and were lower than in prior periods due to our exit on december  from our ma pffs product and our exit from medicaid programs in certain florida counties during premium revenue from our pffs product represented approximately of our ma reportable operating segment revenue and of our consolidated premium revenue for the fiscal year 
regulation provider reimbursement levels are subject to change by the states and cms 
in addition  some hospital contracts are directly tied to state medicaid fee schedules  resulting in reimbursement levels that may be adjusted up or down  generally on a prospective basis  based on adjustments made by the state to the fee schedule 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  such adjustments 
unless such adjustments are mitigated by corresponding changes in premiums  our profitability will be negatively impacted 
financial impact of government investigations and litigation for a complete discussion of government investigations and litigation including the associated financial impact  please refer to our selling  general and administrative expense discussion under results of operations below and part iv  item a note commitments and contingencies 
basis of presentation segments reportable operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which discrete financial information is available and evaluated on a regular basis by the company s decision makers to determine how resources should be allocated to an individual segment and to assess performance of those segments 
previously  we reported two operating segments  medicaid and medicare  which coincide with our two main business lines 
during the first quarter of  we reassessed our segment reporting practices and made revisions to reflect our current method of managing performance and determining resource allocation  which includes reviewing the results of our pdp operations separately from other medicare products 
accordingly  we now have three reportable segments medicaid  ma and pdp 
the pffs product that we exited december  is reported within the ma segment 
the prior periods have been revised to reflect this segment presentation 

table of contents medicaid medicaid was established to provide medical assistance to low income and disabled persons 
it is state operated and implemented  although it is funded and regulated by both the state and federal governments 
our medicaid segment includes plans for beneficiaries of tanf  ssi  abd and state based programs that are not part of medicaid programs  such as chip and fhp programs for qualifying families that are not eligible for medicaid because they exceed the applicable income thresholds 
tanf generally provides assistance to low income families with children  abd and ssi generally provide assistance to low income aged  blind or disabled individuals 
the medicaid programs and services we offer to our members vary by state and county and are designed to serve our various constituencies effectively in the communities we serve 
although our medicaid contracts determine to a large extent the type and scope of health care services that we arrange for our members  in certain markets we customize our benefits in ways that we believe make our products more attractive 
our medicaid plans provide our members with access to a broad spectrum of medical benefits from many facets of primary care and preventive programs to full hospitalization and tertiary care 
in general  members are required to use our network  except in cases of emergencies  transition of care or when network providers are unavailable to meet their medical needs  and generally must receive a referral from their pcp in order to receive health care from specialists  such as surgeons or neurologists 
members do not pay any premiums  deductibles or co payments for most of our medicaid plans 
medicare advantage medicare is a federal health insurance program that provides eligible persons age and over  and some disabled persons  a variety of hospital  medical and prescription drug benefits 
our ma segment consists of ma plans which  following the exit of our pffs product on december   is comprised of ccps 
ma is medicare s managed care alternative to original medicare  which provides individuals standard medicare benefits directly through cms 
ccps are administered through hmos and generally require members to seek health care services and select a pcp from a network of health care providers 
in addition  we offer medicare part d coverage  which provides prescription drug benefits  as a component of our ma plans 
we cover a wide spectrum of medical services through our ma plans including  in some cases  additional benefits not covered by original medicare  such as vision  dental and hearing services 
through these enhanced benefits  the out of pocket expenses incurred by our members are reduced  which allows our members to better manage their health care costs 
most of our ma plans require members to pay a co payment  which varies depending on the services and level of benefits provided 
typically  members of our ma ccps are required to use our network of providers except in cases such as emergencies  transition of care or when specialty providers are unavailable to meet a member s medical needs 
ma ccp members may see out of network specialists if they receive referrals from their pcps and may pay incremental cost sharing 
in most of our markets  we also offer special needs plans to individuals who are dually eligible for medicare and medicaid 
these plans  commonly called d snps  are designed to provide specialized care and support for beneficiaries who are eligible for both medicare and medicaid 
we believe that our d snps are attractive to these beneficiaries due to the enhanced benefit offerings and clinical support programs 
prescription drug plans we offer stand alone medicare part d coverage to medicare eligible beneficiaries through our pdp segment 
the medicare part d prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs 
the government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage  adjusted for risk factor payments 
additional subsidies are provided for dually eligible beneficiaries and specified low income beneficiaries 
the medicare part d program offers national in network prescription drug coverage that is subject to limitations in certain circumstances 
depending on medical coverage type  a beneficiary has various options for accessing drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in original medicare can either join a stand alone pdp or forego part d drug coverage 
beneficiaries enrolled in ma ccps can join a plan with part d coverage  select a separate part d plan  or forego part d coverage 

table of contents segment financial performance measures we use three measures to assess the performance of our reportable operating segments premium revenue  mbr and gross margin 
our mbr measures the ratio of our medical benefits expense to premiums earned  after excluding medicaid premium taxes 
our gross margin is defined as our premium revenue less our medical benefits expense 
our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health and prescription drug plans  predict and effectively manage medical benefits expense relative to the primarily fixed premiums we receive  including reserve estimates and pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  and attract and retain members 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and profitability 
the effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers may impose further risks to our profitability and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
premium revenue we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to  or have selected  us to provide health care services under medicaid and medicare 
the primarily fixed premiums we receive for each member varies according to the specific government program 
the premiums we receive under each of our government benefit plans are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period 
these premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract period 
for further information regarding premium revenues  please refer below to premium revenue recognition under critical accounting estimates 
medical benefits expense our largest expense is the cost of medical benefits that we provide  which is based primarily on our arrangements with health care providers and utilization of health care services by our members 
our arrangements with providers primarily fall into two broad categories capitation arrangements  pursuant to which we pay the capitated providers a fixed fee per member and fee for service as well as risk sharing arrangements  pursuant to which the provider assumes a portion of the risk of the cost of the health care provided 
capitation payments represented  and of our total medical benefits expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other components of medical benefits expense are variable and require estimation and ongoing cost management 
we use a variety of techniques to manage our medical benefits expense  including payment methods to providers  referral requirements  quality and disease management programs  reinsurance and member co payments and premiums for some of our medicare plans 
national health care costs have been increasing at a higher rate than the general inflation rate  however  relatively small changes in our medical benefits expense relative to premiums that we receive can create significant changes in our financial results 
changes in health care laws  regulations and practices  levels of use of health care services  competitive pressures  hospital costs  major epidemics  terrorism or bio terrorism  new medical technologies and other external factors could reduce our ability to manage our medical benefits expense effectively 
estimation of medical benefits payable and medical benefits expense is our most significant critical accounting estimate 
for further information regarding medical benefits expense  please refer below to estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable under critical accounting estimates 
gross margin and medical benefits ratio our primary tools for measuring profitability are gross margin and mbr 
changes in gross margin and mbr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicaid and medicare funding  changes in the mix of medicaid and medicare membership  our ability to manage medical costs and changes in accounting estimates related to ibnr claims 
we use gross margin and mbrs both to monitor our management of medical benefits and medical benefits expense and to make various business decisions  including what health care plans to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit and which health care providers to select 
although gross margin and mbrs play an important role in our business strategy  we may be willing to enter new geographical markets and or enter into provider arrangements that might produce a less favorable gross margin and mbr if those arrangements  such as capitation or risk sharing  would likely lower our exposure to variability in medical costs or for other reasons 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth data from our consolidated statements of operations  as well as other key data used in our results of operations discussion 
the historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period

as of december   we served approximately  members  an increase of approximately  members from december  we experienced membership growth in all of our segments 
our medicaid segment grew with the launch of the kentucky medicaid program on november  as of december   we served  medicaid members in kentucky 
for our ma segment  we focused on our membership growth activities during the annual election period in the fourth quarter of our products have benefit designs that are attractive to both current and prospective members 
we invested in strengthening our sales processes and organization and ensuring an effective on boarding experience for our new members 
we added approximately  ma members from december  in our pdp segment  our plans were below the benchmark in of the cms regions in  an increase of one region from additionally  we were within the de minimis range in eight additional regions 
as a result  we added approximately  pdp members compared to december  
table of contents in  we expect membership growth in our medicaid and ma segments  offset in part by reduced pdp segment membership 
the growth expectation in medicaid is driven by membership increases in kentucky subsequent to our initial launch  the contract award for hawaii s quest medicaid program in january that is effective july   as well as membership growth opportunities existing in states in which we currently operate 
the growth expectation in ma is based on results of the annual election period  which resulted in an increase of approximately  members effective january   as well as our continued focus on dually eligible beneficiaries 
however  as a result of our pdp bids  our pdp membership declined to approximately  as of january  we anticipate pdp segment membership will decrease slightly during the remainder of due to normal attrition being offset by fewer new members as we will be auto assigned newly eligible members in fewer regions 
vs 
as of december   we served approximately  members  a decrease of  members from the  members we served as of december  as previously discussed  our ma segment includes results from the pffs product that we exited on december  the overall membership decrease was due primarily to our december  exit from our pffs product  which accounted for  ma members as of december  as well as a decline in ma ccp membership 
the decrease in ma ccp resulted from the cms medicare marketing sanction  which was lifted in november however  we were not eligible to receive auto assignments of low income subsidy  dually eligible beneficiaries into our pdp plans for january enrollment 
we received auto assignments of pdp members in subsequent months  although such assignments were below the level we typically experience in the month of january 
net income loss vs 
for the year ended december   our net income was million compared to a net loss of million for the same period in excluding the impact of investigation related settlements  litigation costs and gain on repurchase of subordinated notes  all of which amounted to a net expense of million and million  net of tax  for the years ended december  and  respectively  net income increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in resulted mainly from improved results in our medicaid segment  largely driven by increased premium revenue and the impact of net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable  rate increases in certain markets  and to a lesser extent  improved results in our pdp segment  mainly driven by an increase in membership 
such increases were partially offset by an increase in sg a expense and interest incurred on debt 
vs 
for the year ended december   the net loss was million compared to million of net income for the same period in excluding investigation related and litigation resolution costs of million and million  net of tax  net income would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income  as adjusted  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly the result of the loss of gross margin from the withdrawal of our pffs product and increases in medicare related marketing costs  partially offset by our overall mbr improvement and reductions in sg a expenses 
premium revenue vs 
premium revenue for the year ended december  increased by approximately million  or  compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to membership growth during in our pdp and ma segments  rate increases in certain of our medicaid markets  the launch of our kentucky medicaid program in november and additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in georgia 
premium revenue includes million and million of medicaid premium taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents vs 
our ma segment includes results from the pffs product that we exited on december  our pffs product contributed approximately  million of premium revenue for the year ended december  we recognized million for retrospective risk adjusted premium settlements related to our pffs product for the year ended december  excluding the impact of premium taxes as well as premium revenue from our pffs product  premium revenue for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to  million from  million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in premium revenue is primarily attributable to the decline in membership in our ma segment and lower membership in our pdp segment in the first half of resulting from our loss of membership due to the cms marketing sanction and higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of our pdp product  partially offset by an increase in medicaid segment premium revenue  due primarily to reductions by certain states that occurred earlier in the year and membership growth 
premium revenue includes million and million of medicaid premium taxes for the years ended december  and  respectively 
investment and other income vs 
investment and other income amounted to million in compared to million in the decrease was due to lower volumes of specialty prescription drugs sold to non members  partially offset by an increase in investment income resulting from higher average investment balances 
vs 
for the year ended december   investment and other income decreased million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to reduced market rates on lower average cash and investment balances  partially offset by the increase in other income attributed to shifting our investment portfolio during the third quarter of from tax exempt to taxable investments  which typically generates a higher yield  and from other income derived primarily from co payments collected on member prescriptions and sales of prescription drugs to non members that can vary during any particular period 
medical benefits expense vs 
total medical benefits expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the same period in the increase in medical benefits expense is due mainly to the increase in pdp membership  the increase in mbr in the pdp segment that was consistent with our bids  and increased membership and higher mbr in the ma segment 
the increases were partially offset by lower expense in the medicaid segment resulting principally from the impact of net favorable prior period development in medical benefits payable and our medical expense initiatives 
for the year ended december   medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately million of net favorable development related to prior years 
for the year ended december   medical benefits expense was impacted by approximately million of net favorable reserve development related to prior years

however  effective july   georgia began assessing premium taxes again on medicaid premiums 
therefore  during the first half of  we were not assessed  nor did we remit  any taxes on premiums in georgia 
we were assessed and remitted taxes on premiums in hawaii  missouri  new york and ohio for both the and periods

for gaap reporting purposes  medicaid premium taxes are included in premium revenue 
vs 
excluding medicaid premium taxes  medicaid premium revenue for the year ended december  increased when compared to the same period in the increase in premium revenue was mainly due to rate increases in certain markets  the launch of the kentucky medicaid program on november  and additional premiums related to certain retrospective maternity claims that were impacted by a change that the dch made to its methodology for determining and accepting qualifying maternity claims 
medicaid medical benefits expense for the year ended december  decreased slightly when compared to the same period in due mainly to the impact of net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable and the impact of medical cost initiatives that we have implemented  partially offset by a change in member mix and the launch of the kentucky medicaid program in november the net favorable reserve development resulted primarily from unusually low utilization in our medicaid mbr improved by approximately basis points in compared to  and the decrease was also driven by the net favorable reserve development of prior period medical benefits payable  the impact of medical cost initiatives  rate increases in certain of our medicaid markets and additional premiums recognized in connection with retrospective maternity claims in georgia

pdp premium revenue for the year ended december  decreased million to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the lower premium revenue in is the result of lower membership in the first half of the year and a higher returned premium under the risk corridor provisions of the pdp product 
the higher risk corridor returned premium is due to the lower claim expense in membership increased by approximately  members to  as of december  from  as of december   despite lower membership throughout the first half of the year 
pdp membership at the beginning of was lower than the end of as we were unable to receive auto assigned membership in january following the release of the cms marketing sanction

pdp gross margin for the year ended december  increased million to million from million for the same period in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was due mainly to better overall performance of the part d product and improved mbr despite the decrease in premiums 
outlook given our bid results discussed in business and financial outlook market developments  pdp segment membership for january is approximately  the decrease from  as of december  is from the reassignment to other plans of members who were auto assigned to us in or prior years

liquidity and capital resources overview each of our existing and anticipated sources of cash is impacted by operational and financial risks that influence the overall amount of cash generated and the capital available to us 
for a further discussion of risks that can affect our liquidity  see part  item a risk factors 
cash generating activities our business consists of operations conducted by our regulated subsidiaries  including hmos and insurance subsidiaries  and our non regulated subsidiaries

our unregulated cash and cash equivalents increased by million in primarily as a result of million of net term loan proceeds and million in dividends received from certain of our regulated subsidiaries  offset in part by million of payments in connection with the resolution of government investigations and related litigation and the net cash impact of the repurchase of the subordinated notes and associated reduction in our fourth quarter estimated tax payment 
initiatives to increase our unregulated cash we are pursuing alternatives to raise additional unregulated cash 
some of these initiatives include  but are not limited to  consideration of obtaining dividends from certain of our regulated subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to access any available excess capital and or accessing the debt and equity capital markets 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that we will obtain applicable state regulatory approvals for additional dividends to our non regulated subsidiaries by our regulated subsidiaries or be successful in accessing the capital markets if we determine to do so 
credit facility in august  we entered into a million senior secured credit agreement the credit agreement that can be used for general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan facility as well as a million revolving credit facility 
upon closing  we borrowed million pursuant to the term loan facility and incurred approximately million of debt issuance costs that have been deferred and will be amortized over the life of the agreement 
the credit agreement replaces the previous credit facility  which had never been drawn upon and which has now been terminated 
we had at all times remained in compliance with all covenants associated with the former agreement 
both the term loan and revolving credit facility are set to expire in august subject to adjustment for prepayments  the term loan will amortize in quarterly installments of  for the first four quarters   for the next eight quarters   for the next four quarters and  for the next three quarters  with the remaining balance due upon maturity 
as of december   our remaining term loan balance was million  which is included in the current portion of long term debt and long term debt line items in our consolidated balance sheet 

table of contents table of contents our term loan as of december  bears interest at 
loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as alternate base rate abr loans that are outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to i the greatest of a the prime rate in effect on such day  b the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus of  and c the adjusted london inter bank offered rate adjusted libor for a one month interest period on such day plus plus ii the applicable margin 
loans designated by us at the time of borrowing as eurodollar loans that are outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the adjusted libor for the interest period in effect for such borrowing plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin means a percentage ranging from to per annum for abr loans and a percentage ranging from to per annum for eurodollar loans  depending upon our ratio of total debt to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
unutilized commitments under the credit agreement are subject to a fee of to depending upon the company s ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda 
interest on the term loan is payable based on the libor election period  which ranges from one to six months based upon our election  with interest on the unutilized commitment payable quarterly

the credit agreement is subject to customary covenants and restrictions which  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  the credit agreement also includes certain financial covenants that require a a minimum ratio of total debt to consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement  b a minimum interest expense and principal repayment coverage ratio  c a minimum level of statutory net worth for our hmo and insurance subsidiaries  and d a requirement to maintain cash in an amount equal to one year of payment obligations due and payable to the department of justice during the next twelve consecutive months  so long as such obligations remain outstanding 
the credit agreement also contains customary representations and warranties and events of default 
the payment of outstanding principal under the credit agreement and accrued interest thereon may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable upon our default of payment or other performance obligations or our failure to comply with financial or other covenants in the credit agreement  subject to applicable notice requirements and cure periods as provided in the credit agreement 
as of the date of this filing  the revolving credit facility has not been drawn upon and we remain in compliance with all covenants 
issuance and repurchase of subordinated notes on september   we issued tradable unsecured subordinated notes having an aggregate par value of million  with a fixed coupon of and a maturity date of december  these notes were issued in connection with the stipulation and settlement agreement  which was approved in may  to resolve the putative class action complaints previously filed against us in on december  we repurchased all of the million subordinated notes at of face value 
we recorded a gain on the repurchase of subordinated notes in the amount of million 
interest of approximately million was incurred on these notes in  including amounts retroactive to may  and was paid at the time of repurchase

auction rate securities as of december   we held municipal note investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  which carry investment grade credit ratings 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every seven or days 
as of the date of this form k  auctions have failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions will succeed in the future 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every seven or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or non existent 
in addition  while all of our auction rate securities currently carry investment grade ratings  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 

table of contents although auctions continue to fail  we believe we will be able to liquidate these securities without significant loss 
there are government guarantees or municipal bond insurance in place and we have the ability and the present intent to hold these securities until maturity or market stability is restored 
accordingly  we do not believe our auction rate securities are impaired and as a result  we have not recorded any impairment losses for our auction rate securities 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value 
the final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as years 
the weighted average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is years 
during  auction rate securities of million  in the aggregate  were called at par  at the option of the issuer 
financial impact of government investigation and litigation we have expended significant financial resources in connection with the investigations and related litigation 
since the inception of these investigations through december   we have incurred a total of approximately million for administrative expenses associated with  or consequential to  these governmental and company investigations specifically for legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  employee recruitment and retention costs and other similar expenses  prior to any insurance recoveries 
in connection with the settlement agreement that we reached with the lead plaintiffs to resolve certain putative class action complaints  which was approved by the united states district court for the middle district of florida in may  we delivered to the escrow agent on behalf of the class  a million non negotiable  non interest bearing  promissory note that was due and payable in full on july  this liability was previously accrued as part of amounts accrued related to the investigation resolution and this amount was paid in full on july  in march  we paid million and in september  we issued million of tradable unsecured subordinated notes in connection with the resolution of these class action complaints 
subsequently  in december  we repurchased the subordinated notes as discussed in issuance and repurchase of subordinated notes above 
in august  we entered into an agreement and release with the carriers of our d o liability insurance relating to coverage we sought for claims relating to the previously disclosed government investigations and related litigation 
we agreed to accept immediate payment of million  including million received by us in prior years  in satisfaction of the million face amount of the relevant d o insurance policies and the carriers agreed to waive any rights they may have to challenge our coverage under the policies 
the agreement and release did not include a million face amount policy we maintain for non indemnifiable securities claims by directors and officers during the same time period and such policy is not affected by the agreement and release 
accordingly  we recorded the million of insurance proceeds as a reduction to sg a expenses at the time the agreement was executed in no additional recoveries with respect to such matters are expected under our insurance policies and all expenses incurred by us in the future for these matters will not be further reimbursed by our insurance policies 
we currently maintain directors and officers liability insurance in the amount of million for other matters not addressed above 
regulatory capital and dividend restrictions our operations are conducted primarily through hmo and insurance subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are licensed by the insurance department in the state in which they operate  except our new york hmo subsidiary  which is licensed as a prepaid health services plan by the new york state department of health  and are subject to the rules  regulation and oversight of the applicable state agencies in the areas of licensing and solvency 
state insurance laws and regulations prescribe accounting practices for determining statutory net income and capital and surplus 
each of our regulated subsidiaries is required to report regularly on its operational and financial performance to the appropriate regulatory agency in the state in which it is licensed 
these reports describe each of our regulated subsidiaries capital structure  ownership  financial condition  certain intercompany transactions and business operations 
from time to time  any of our regulated subsidiaries may be selected to undergo periodic audits  examinations or reviews by the applicable state agency of our operational and financial assertions 
each of our regulated subsidiaries generally must obtain approval from  or provide notice to  the state in which it is domiciled before entering into certain transactions such as declaring dividends in excess of certain thresholds  entering into other arrangements with related parties  and acquisitions or similar transactions involving an hmo or insurance company  or any change in control 
for purposes of these laws  in general  control commonly is presumed to exist when a person  group of persons or entity  directly or indirectly  owns  controls or holds the power to vote or more of the voting securities of another entity 
each of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries must maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital determined by statute or regulation 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  a percentage of certain liabilities  a statutory minimum rbc requirement or other financial ratios 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic  and have been adopted by most states 
as of december   our hmo operations in connecticut  georgia  illinois  indiana  louisiana  missouri  new jersey  ohio and texas as well as three of our insurance company subsidiaries were subject to rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements may be modified as each state legislature deems appropriate for that state 
the rbc formula  based on asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the acl  which represents the amount of capital required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain a minimum of the greater of of the required acl or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
our subsidiaries operating in texas  georgia and ohio are required to maintain statutory capital at rbc levels equal to  and  respectively  of the applicable acl 
failure to maintain these requirements would trigger regulatory action by the state 
at december   our hmo and insurance subsidiaries were in compliance with these minimum capital requirements 
the combined statutory capital and surplus of our hmo and insurance subsidiaries was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  compared to the required surplus of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 

table of contents the statutory framework for our regulated subsidiaries minimum capital changes over time 
for instance  rbc requirements may be adopted by more of the states in which we operate 
these subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight powers 
in addition  regulators could require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth in excess of the amount required under the applicable state laws if the regulators determine that maintaining such additional statutory net worth is in the best interest of our members and other constituents 
moreover  if we expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  we may be required to make additional statutory capital contributions 
in addition to the foregoing requirements  our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans and other transfers of cash 
dividend restrictions vary by state  but the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid without prior approval from the applicable state is subject to  among other things  restrictions relating to statutory capital  surplus and net income for the previous year 
states may disapprove any dividend that  together with other dividends paid by a subsidiary in the prior twelve months  exceeds the regulatory maximum as computed for the subsidiary based on its statutory surplus and net income 
also  we may only invest in the types of investments allowed by the state in order to qualify as admitted assets and we are required by certain states to deposit or pledge assets that are considered as restricted assets 
at december  and  all of our restricted assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents  money market accounts  certificates of deposits  and us government securities 
overview of cash flow activities our cash flows from operations are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operations net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash provided by operations we generally receive premiums in advance of payments of claims for health care services  however  cash flows related to our operations can fluctuate significantly in a particular period depending on the timing of premiums receipts from our government partners or payments related to resolving government investigations and related litigation 
the net cash inflow from operations for the years ended december   and was primarily due to changes in the receivables and liabilities due to timing of cash receipts and payments

actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting estimates relating to premium revenue recognition  medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable  and goodwill and intangible assets are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
premium revenue recognition we receive premiums from state and federal agencies for the members that are assigned to  or have selected  us to provide health care services under medicaid and medicare contracts 
the premiums we receive for each member vary according to the specific government program and are generally determined at the beginning of the contract period 
these premiums are subject to adjustment throughout the term of the contract by cms and the states throughout the term of the contracts  although such adjustments are typically made at the commencement of each new contract renewal period 
we recognize premium revenues in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
premiums are billed monthly for coverage in the following month and we are paid generally in the month in which we provide services 
any amounts that have been earned and have not been received are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as premium receivables 
any amounts received by us in advance of the period of service are recorded as a liability  unearned premiums  in our consolidated balance sheets and are not recognized as revenue until the respective services have been provided 
on a monthly basis  we bill members for any premiums for which they are responsible according to their respective plan 
we estimate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of member billings that may not be fully collectible based on historical trends 
an allowance is established for the estimated amount that may not be collectible and a liability is established for premium expected to be returned 
historically  the allowance for member premiums receivable has not been significant relative to premium revenue 
we record adjustments to revenues based on member retroactivity 
these adjustments reflect changes in the number and eligibility status of enrollees subsequent to when revenue was billed 
premium payments that we receive are based upon eligibility lists produced by the government 
we verify these lists to determine whether we have been paid for the correct premium category and program 
from time to time  the states or cms requires us to reimburse them for premiums that we received based on an eligibility list that a state  cms or we later discover contains individuals who were not eligible for any government sponsored program or belong to a plan other than ours 
the verification and subsequent membership changes may result in additional amounts due to us or we may owe premiums back to the government 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity adjustments each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate  the estimates of retroactivity adjustments are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the volume of member and contract renewal activity and other information 
the amounts receivable or payable identified by us through reconciliation and verification of agency eligibility lists relate to current and prior periods 
the amounts receivable from government agencies for reconciling items were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the amounts due to government agencies for reconciling items were million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts are recorded net and are included in premium receivables in the consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents medicaid our medicaid segment generates revenues primarily from premiums received from the states in which we operate health plans 
we receive a fixed premium pmpm pursuant to our state contracts 
our medicaid contracts with state governments are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
annual rate changes are recorded when they become effective 
we generally receive premium payments during the month in which we provide services and recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide such services to our members 
in some instances  our base premiums are subject to risk score adjustments based on the acuity of our membership relative to the entire state s medicaid membership 
in georgia  illinois  kentucky  missouri  new york and ohio  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments for newborns and or obstetric deliveries 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are generated 
upon delivery of a newborn  each state is notified according to the contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately million and million of such premium revenue  respectively 
the revenue recognized during the year ending december  includes million related to certain retrospective maternity claims from  as a result of a change in the georgia dch s methodology for accepting qualifying maternity claims made in additionally  in some states  supplemental payments are received for certain services such as high cost drugs and early childhood prevention screenings 
revenues are recorded based on membership and eligibility data provided by the states  which may be adjusted by the states for any subsequent updates to this data 
historically  these eligibility adjustments have been immaterial in relation to total revenue recorded and are reflected in the period known 
during the year ended december   georgia dch made retroactive premium adjustments for overpayments related to a reconciliation of duplicate member records and members belonging to a plan other than ours for periods dating back to the beginning of the program in in accordance with the policy stated above  we had previously identified and accrued an estimated liability for overpayments that we believed would be returned to georgia dch 
in addition  georgia dch has notified us of expected retroactive premium adjustments for the understatement of historical capitation premium rates for the periods affected by duplicative enrollment 
the net impact to premium revenue resulting from the adjustments was immaterial to our consolidated results of operations 
minimum medical expense provisions our florida medicaid and healthy kids contracts and illinois medicaid contract require us to expend a minimum percentage of premiums on eligible medical expense 
to the extent that we expend less than the minimum percentage of the premiums on eligible medical expense  we are required to refund all or some portion of the difference between the minimum and our actual allowable medical expense 
we estimate the amounts due to the states as a return of premium each period based on the terms of our contracts with the applicable state agency  and such amounts are included in our consolidated results of operations as adjustments to premium revenues 
our liability to states under their respective minimum medical expense provisions was million as of december  and million as of december  medicare advantage the amount of premiums we receive for each ma member is established by contract  although the rates vary according to a combination of factors  including upper payment limits established by cms  the member s geographic location  age  gender  medical history or condition  or the services rendered to the member 
we also offer part d coverage as a component of our ma plans 
see prescription drug plans pdps below for a complete discussion of our revenue accounting policies associated with this benefit 
ma premiums are due monthly and are recognized as revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to members 
our ma contracts with cms generally have terms of one year and expire at the end of each calendar year 
risk adjusted premiums cms employs a risk adjustment model to determine the premium amount it pays for each ma member 
this model apportions premiums paid to all ma plans according to the health status of each beneficiary enrolled 
as a result  our cms monthly premium payments per member may change materially  either favorably or unfavorably 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for ma members with predictably higher costs 
diagnosis data from inpatient and ambulatory treatment settings are used to calculate the risk adjusted premiums we receive 
we collect claims and encounter data and submit the necessary diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the monthly premium payments to plans based on normalized risk scores of each member from the prior year  generally at the beginning of the calendar year 
annually  cms provides the updated risk scores to the plans and revises premium rates prospectively  beginning with the july remittance for current plan year members 
cms will also calculate the retroactive adjustments to premium related to the revised risk scores for the current year for current plan year members and for the prior year for prior plan year members 
we reassess our estimates of the initial cms settlement and the final cms settlement each reporting period and any resulting adjustments are made to premium revenue 

table of contents we develop our estimates for ma risk adjusted premiums utilizing historical experience and predictive models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each cms plan year 
our models are populated with available risk score data on our ma members 
risk premium adjustments are based on member risk score data from the previous year 
risk score data for members who entered our plans during the current plan year  however  is not available for use in our models  therefore  we make assumptions regarding the risk scores of this subset of our member population 
all such estimated amounts are periodically updated as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or we receive notification from cms of such settlement amounts 
the data provided to cms to determine the risk score is subject to audit by cms even after the annual settlements occur 
these audits may result in the refund of premiums to cms previously received by us 
while our experience to date has not resulted in a material refund  this refund could be significant in the future  which would reduce our premium revenue in the year that cms determines repayment is required 
cms has performed and continues to perform radv audits of selected ma plans to validate the provider coding practices under the risk adjustment model used to calculate the premium paid for each ma member 
our florida ma plan was selected by cms for audit for the contract year and we anticipate that cms will conduct additional audits of other plans and contract years on an ongoing basis 
the cms audit process selects a sample of enrollees for medical record review from each contract selected 
we have responded to cms s audit requests by retrieving and submitting all available medical records and provider attestations to substantiate cms sampled diagnosis codes 
cms will use this documentation to calculate a payment error rate for our florida ma plan premiums 
cms has not indicated a schedule for processing or otherwise responding to our submissions 
cms has indicated that payment adjustments resulting from its radv audits will not be limited to risk scores for the specific beneficiaries for which errors are found  but will be extrapolated to the relevant plan population 
in december  cms issued a draft audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology that it proposes to use in conducting these audits 
cms invited public comment on the proposed audit methodology and announced in february that it will revise its proposed approach based on the comments received 
cms has not given a specific timetable for issuing a final version of the audit sampling and payment error calculation methodology 
given that the radv audit methodology is new and is subject to modification  there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied to ma organizations like our florida ma plan 
at this time  we do not know whether cms will require retroactive or subsequent payment adjustments to be made using an audit methodology that may not compare the coding of our providers to the coding of original medicare and other ma plan providers  or whether any of our other plans will be randomly selected or targeted for a similar audit by cms 
we are also unable to determine whether any conclusions that cms may make  based on the audit of our plan and others  will cause us to change our revenue estimation process 
because of this lack of clarity from cms  we are unable to estimate with any reasonable confidence a coding or payment error rate or predict the impact of extrapolating an applicable error rate to our florida ma plan premiums 
however  it is likely that a payment adjustment will occur as a result of these audits  and that any such adjustment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows  possibly in and beyond 
prescription drug plans pdps prescription drug benefits under part d are provided on both a stand alone basis and also in connection with our ma plans 
annually  we provide written bids to cms for our pdps  which reflect the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
substantially all of the premium for this insurance is paid by the federal government  and the balance is due from the enrolled beneficiaries 
the recognition of the premium and subsidy components under part d is described below member premium we receive a monthly premium from members based on the plan year bid we submitted to cms 
the member premium  which is fixed for the entire plan year  is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue 
we establish a reserve for member premium that is past due that reflects our estimate of the collectability of the member premium 
cms direct premium subsidy we receive a monthly premium from cms based on the plan year bid we submitted to cms 
the monthly payment is a risk adjusted amount per member and is based upon the member s health status  as determined by cms 
the cms premium is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue 
risk adjusted premiums the monthly cms direct premium subsidy is based upon the members health status  which is determined by cms  as more fully described above under risk adjusted premiums 
we do not have access to diagnosis data with respect to our stand alone pdp members and therefore  we cannot anticipate changes in our members risk scores 
changes in cms premiums related to risk score adjustments for our stand alone pdp membership are recognized when the amounts become determinable and collectability is reasonably assured  which occurs when we are notified by cms of such adjustments 
although such adjustments have not been considered to be material in the past  future adjustments could be material 

table of contents low income premium subsidy for qualifying lis members  cms pays us for some or all of the lis member s monthly premium 
the cms payment is dependent upon a member s income level which is determined by the social security administration 
low income premium is recognized over the contract period and reported as premium revenue 
low income cost sharing subsidy for qualifying lis members  cms will reimburse us for all or a portion of the lis member s deductible  coinsurance and co payment amounts above the out of pocket threshold for low income beneficiaries 
low income cost sharing subsidies are paid by cms prospectively as a fixed amount per member per month  and are determined based upon the plan year bid we submitted to cms 
following the plan year  cms performs an annual reconciliation of the lics received by the plan sponsor to the actual amount paid by the plan sponsor 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidy cms reimburses us for of the drug costs after a member reaches his or her out of pocket catastrophic threshold through a catastrophic reinsurance subsidy 
catastrophic reinsurance subsidies are paid by cms prospectively as a fixed amount per member per month and are determined based upon the plan year bid we submitted to cms 
after the close of the annual plan year  cms reconciles actual experience compared to catastrophic reinsurance subsidies paid to our plans and any differences are settled between cms and our plans 
coverage gap discount subsidy beginning in  cms provides monthly prospective payments for pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts made available to members 
the prospective discount payments are determined based upon the plan year bid submitted by plan sponsors to cms and current plan enrollment 
following the plan year  cms performs an annual reconciliation of the prospective discount payments received by the plan sponsor to the cost of actual manufacturer discounts made available to each plan sponsor s enrollees under the program 
low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance subsidies and coverage gap discount subsidies represent funding from cms for which we assume no risk 
the receipt of these subsidies and the payments of the actual prescription drug costs related to the low income cost sharing  catastrophic reinsurance and coverage gap discounts are not recognized as premium revenues or benefits expense  but are reported on a net basis as funds receivable held for the benefit of members in the consolidated balance sheets 
these receipts and payments are reported as financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
after the close of the annual plan year  cms reconciles actual experience to prospective payments paid to our plans and any differences are settled between cms and our plans 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments related to the cms annual reconciliation of prior plan year low income cost sharing and catastrophic reinsurance subsidies 
cms risk corridor premiums from cms are subject to risk sharing through the medicare part d risk corridor provisions 
the cms risk corridor calculation compares the target amount of prescription drug costs limited to costs under the standard coverage as defined by cms less rebates in our annual plan bid to actual experience 
variances of more than above the target amount will result in cms making additional payments to us  and variances of more than below the target amount will require us to refund to cms a portion of the premiums we received 
risk corridor payments due to or from cms are estimated throughout the year as if the annual contract were to terminate at the end of the reporting period  and are recognized as adjustments to premium revenues and other payables to government partners 
this estimate provides no consideration of future pharmacy claims experience  but does require us to consider factors that may not be certain  including membership  risk scores  prescription drug events  or pdes  and rebates 
approximately nine months after the close of the annual plan year  cms reconciles actual experience to the target amount and any differences are settled between cms and our plans 
historically  we have not experienced material adjustments related to the cms settlement of the prior plan year risk corridor estimate 

table of contents estimating medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable the cost of medical benefits is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of ibnr medical benefits 
medical benefits payable included in our consolidated balance sheets represents amounts for claims fully adjudicated but not yet paid and estimates for ibnr  and includes direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid or payable to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
such expense may also include reserves for estimated referral claims related to health care providers under contract with us who are financially troubled or insolvent and who may not be able to honor their obligations for the costs of medical services provided by other providers 
in these instances  we may be required to honor these obligations for legal or business reasons 
based on our current assessment of providers under contract with us  such losses have not been and are not expected to be significant 
also  included in direct medical expense are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement  claims payment differences and amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses  which are recorded in selling  general  and administrative expense 
the following table provides a detail of the components of medical benefits payable december  of december  of total total in millions claims adjudicated but not yet paid ibnr total medical benefits payable the medical benefits payable estimate has been and continues to be our most significant estimate included in our financial statements 
we historically have used and continue to use a consistent methodology for estimating our medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable 
our policy is to record management s best estimate of medical benefits payable based on the experience and information available to us at the time 
this estimate is determined utilizing standard actuarial methodologies based upon historical experience and key assumptions consisting of trend factors and completion factors using an assumption of moderately adverse conditions  which vary by business segment 
these standard actuarial methodologies include using  among other factors  contractual requirements  historic utilization trends  the interval between the date services are rendered and the date claims are paid  denied claims activity  disputed claims activity  benefits changes  expected health care cost inflation  seasonality patterns  maturity of lines of business and changes in membership 
the factors and assumptions described above that are used to develop our estimate of medical benefits expense and medical benefits payable inherently are subject to greater variability when there is more limited experience or information available to us 
the ultimate claims payment amounts  patterns and trends for new products and geographic areas cannot be precisely predicted at their onset  since we  the providers and the members do not have experience in these products or geographic areas 
standard accepted actuarial methodologies  discussed above  would allow for this inherent variability 
this can result in larger differences between the originally estimated medical benefits payable and the actual claims amounts paid 
conversely  during periods where our products and geographies are more stable and mature  we have more reliable claims payment patterns and trend experience 
with more reliable data  we should be able to more closely estimate the ultimate claims payment amounts  therefore  we may experience smaller differences between our original estimate of medical benefits payable and the actual claim amounts paid 
in developing our estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical benefits payable  we estimate claims incurred by applying observed trend factors to the fixed fee pmpm costs for prior months  which costs have been estimated using completion factors  in order to estimate the pmpm costs for the most recent months 
we validate our estimates of the most recent pmpm costs by comparing the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in prior months and actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as congestive heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must continually monitor our historical experience in determining our trend assumptions to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and size of our membership 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitation as opposed to a fee for service basis 
these considerations are reflected in the trends in our medical benefits expense 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management uses considerable judgment in determining medical benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
we believe that the amount of medical benefits payable as of december  is adequate to cover our ultimate liability for unpaid claims as of that date  however  actual payments may differ from established estimates 
if the completion factors we used in estimating our ibnr for the year ended december  were decreased by  our net income would decrease by approximately million 
if the completion factors were increased by  our net income would increase by approximately million 

table of contents table of contents changes in medical benefits payable estimates are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information and medical expense trend data over time 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submissions and our payment processes result in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all of which influence the resulting medical cost trend 
differences between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability  which we refer to as prior period developments  are recorded in the period when such differences become known  and have the effect of increasing or decreasing the reported medical benefits expense and resulting mbr in such periods 
such differences can have a material impact on results of operations in the periods in which they are recognized 
after determining an estimate of the base reserve  actuarial standards of practice require that a margin for uncertainty be considered in determining the estimate for unpaid claim liabilities 
if a margin is included  the claim liabilities should be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
therefore  we make an additional estimate in the process of establishing the ibnr  which also uses standard actuarial techniques  to account for adverse conditions that may cause actual claims to be higher than estimated compared to the base reserve  for which the model is not intended to account 
we refer to this additional liability as the provision for moderately adverse conditions 
the provision for moderately adverse conditions is a component of our overall determination of the adequacy of our ibnr reserve and the provision for moderately adverse conditions is intended to capture the potential adverse development from factors such as our entry into new geographical markets  our provision of services to new populations such as the aged  blind and disabled  the variations in utilization of benefits and increasing medical cost  changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  variations in claims processing speed and patterns  claims payment  the severity of claims  and outbreaks of disease such as the flu 
because of the complexity of our business  the number of states in which we operate  and the need to account for different health care benefit packages among those states  we make an overall assessment of ibnr after considering the base actuarial model reserves and the provision for moderately adverse conditions 
we consistently apply our ibnr estimation methodology from period to period 
we review our overall estimates of ibnr on a monthly basis 
as additional information becomes known to us  we adjust our assumptions accordingly to change our estimate of ibnr 
therefore  if moderately adverse conditions do not occur  evidenced by more complete claims information in the following period  then our prior period estimates will be revised downward  resulting in favorable development 
however  when a portion of the development related to the prior year incurred claims is offset by an increase determined to address moderately adverse conditions for the current year incurred claims  we do not consider that development amount as having any impact on net income during the period 
if moderately adverse conditions occur and are more than we estimated  then our prior period estimates will be revised upward  resulting in unfavorable development  which would decrease current period net income 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of medical benefits payable years ended december  in millions balances as of beginning of period medical benefits incurred related to current period prior periods total medical benefits paid related to current period prior periods total balances as of end of period 
table of contents medical benefits payable recorded at december   and developed favorably by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
a portion of the prior period development was attributable to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  which is included as part of the assumptions 
the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions was substantially offset by the provision for moderately adverse conditions established for claims incurred in the current year 
accordingly  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical benefits payable does not directly correspond to an increase in net income recognized during the period 
in addition to the release of the provision for moderately adverse conditions  medical benefits expense for the years ended december  and was impacted by approximately million and million  respectively  of net favorable development related to prior years 
the net favorable prior year reserve development during resulted primarily from medical cost trend emerging favorably in our medicaid segment due to lower than projected utilization 
the net favorable prior year reserve development in was primarily associated with the exit of the pffs product on december  the factors impacting the changes in the determination of medical benefits payable discussed above were not discernible in advance 
the impact became clearer over time as claim payments were processed and more complete claims information was obtained 
goodwill and other intangible assets we obtained goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of our subsidiaries 
these assets are allocated to reporting segments for impairment testing purposes 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
goodwill attributable to our medicare reporting segment was determined to be fully impaired in and was completely written off 
accordingly  all of the remaining goodwill is attributable to our medicaid reporting segment 
other intangible assets include provider networks  trademarks  state contracts  licenses and permits 
our other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from approximately one to years 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of goodwill or other intangible assets 
such events or changes in circumstances would include significant changes in membership  state funding  medical contracts and provider networks 
we evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets using both the income and market approach 
in doing so  we must make assumptions and estimates  such as projected revenues and the discount factor  in estimating fair values 
while we believe these assumptions and estimates are appropriate  other assumptions and estimates could be applied and might produce significantly different results 
we use a two step process to review goodwill for impairment 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
an impairment loss is recognized for goodwill and intangible assets if the carrying value of such assets exceeds its fair value 
we select the second quarter of each year for our annual goodwill potential impairment test  which generally coincides with the finalization of federal and state contract negotiations and our initial budgeting process  with the test completed during the third quarter of that year 
as of our most recent testing date  we have determined that the estimated fair value of the medicaid reporting segment exceeded its carrying value and as a result  there were no indications that would require additional impairment testing as of december  we evaluated the intangible assets associated with our pffs business  which primarily consisted of state licenses for the insurance companies that underwrote that line of business 
as we continue to use these company licenses for other lines of business and the licenses have a market value  we determined that these assets were not impaired 
recently adopted accounting standards refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements at part iv  item of this form k for information and disclosures related to new accounting standards which are incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively 
the short term investments consist of highly liquid securities with maturities between three and months as well as longer term bonds with floating interest rates that are considered available for sale 
we held restricted investments of million and million  at december  and  respectively  which consist principally of cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments required by various state statutes or regulations 
these restricted assets are classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date due to the nature of the states requirements 
because of the short term nature of short term and restricted investments  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
at december  and  we held investments classified as long term in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the investments classified as long term are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our long term fixed income investments would decrease by approximately million 
similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments by less than million
