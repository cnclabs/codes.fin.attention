overview we design  develop  manufacture and market aesthetic energy devices to address a range of skin conditions brought on by the effects of aging  environmental factors or hormonal changes 
our products are patented and generally require fda clearance and in europe  the ce mark prior to marketing 
the product technologies we use include rf energy  to heat and shrink collagen and tighten tissue while simultaneously cooling and protecting the surface of the skin  lasers for skin resurfacing and the treatment of actinic keratosis  intense pulsed light ipl for the treatment of mild to moderate acne and other dermatologic conditions  and high intensity ultrasound hifu for the destruction of subcutaneous adipose tissue for the purpose of waist circumference reduction 
we were incorporated in and received fda clearance for our first thermage rf system in through a number of acquisitions  we added the fraxel laser systems from reliant technologies in december  the isolaz ipl system from aesthera corporation in february  the claro ipl personal care acne treatment device from clrs in october  and the liposonix system from our acquisition of medicis technologies corporation in november our latest product introduction is the clear brilliant laser system  for which we received fda clearance in may in addition  fda clearance for the second generation liposonix system which we acquired from medicis pharmaceutical corporation medicis was received in october as of december   we had a global installed base of over  systems 
net revenue for the year ended december  increased or million  to million  from million in  mainly from higher tip revenue and the contributions from the sale of the new clear brilliant products  which launched in april  and the liposonix and claro products  partially offset by a decline in system upgrades  a decrease in system and handpiece sales  a decrease in research and development revenue related to a research contract that ended in and a decrease in service contract amortization 
our business continued to be impacted by the weakness in global economic conditions and tight credit markets  which we believe have continued to contribute to a slowdown in customer purchase decisions 
the tight credit markets limited the ability of some of our customers to obtain financing for the purchase of our products 
in response to the continuing difficulties in the economy  we have implemented a number of initiatives in response to the tight worldwide credit market  including expanding our partner program to include fraxel consumables as well as offering incentives to doctors who become fraxel  thermage  isolaz and liposonix customers 

table of contents acquisition of liposonix on september   we entered into a stock purchase agreement purchase agreement with medicis pursuant to which we agreed to acquire from medicis all the outstanding shares of medicis technologies corporation  subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement 
in connection with the acquisition  a separate subsidiary of medicis agreed to transfer certain assets and assign certain agreements related to liposonix collectively  the transaction 
as a result of the acquisition  we have expanded our product offerings by providing a nonsurgical fat ablation treatment to our customers through our direct sales and distribution networks worldwide 
we closed the transaction on november  at the closing of the transaction  we paid to medicis million in cash  which consisted of an upfront million payment and million of preliminary working capital adjustments 
also on november   we paid a one time payment of million to medicis with respect to the clearance by the fda of the second generation liposonix product which was received on october  we expect to fund the acquisition through existing cash balances and credit facilities 
in addition  we have agreed to pay to medicis additional cash payments  which will expire after approximately seven years  based upon  among other things  the achievement of year to year increases and specified targets in the adjusted net sales and adjusted gross profits of the liposonix products  subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement 
also  upon the closing of the transaction  we assumed the contingent payment obligations of medicis with respect to the former shareholders of liposonix pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger among medicis  liposonix and the other parties thereto dated as of june  we assumed the liposonix bothell  washington facility lease  and expect to maintain this facility and complete integrating it into our existing worldwide operations over the next months 
the fair value of the total contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date of million was estimated by applying a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach using a discount rate of 
as of december   the fair value of this contingent consideration liability has been increased to million to reflect the accretion and accordingly  a million charge was recognized as general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of liposonix from the date of acquisition through december  of the total original purchase price of million  million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets  which are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of four to nine years 
the valuation of identified intangible assets acquired was based on management s estimates  currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
the allocation was based on the fair value of these assets determined using the income approach and the cost method approach 
the income approach uses a discounted cash flow model 
we calculated the present value of the expected future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangibles using a discount rate 
with respect to intangible assets  there are several methods available under the income approach to quantify fair value 
we used two methods to quantify fair value of the acquired intangibles at the acquisition date 
the excess earnings method was used for customer relationships and the relief from royalties method was used for the developed technology and trade name intangibles with royalty rates of and  respectively 
we allocated the residual value of million to goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
the factors that contributed to a premium in the purchase price and the resulting recognition of goodwill were the expansion of the company s recurring revenue model allowing for increased treatment tip usage as well as expanding clinical applications for our physician customers  
table of contents access to an expanded base of industry knowledge and expertise  opportunity to complement our existing products for the aesthetic market with a synergistic technology and new clinical treatment applications  and expansion of our global presence thereby increasing our market penetration 
acquisition of clrs technology corporation on october   we acquired of the common stock of clrs technology corporation clrs  a privately held company for consideration consisting of the payment of approximately million of debt at the closing of the acquisition 
in connection with this transaction  we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement which would have required payments if certain milestones related to revenue from the sale of clrs products and operating income of clrs were achieved during the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date of million was estimated by applying a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach 
key assumptions include i a discount rate of and percent and ii probability of milestone achievement ranging from 
as of december   the fair value of this contingent consideration liability has been reduced to zero as the revenue and operating income milestones were not achieved and accordingly a million gain was recognized in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  as a result of the acquisition  we expanded our product offerings by providing a consumer based treatment of acne to our customers through a retail channel 
of the total original purchase price of million  million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets  which are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of four to six years

goodwill arising from the acquisition is attributable to the workforce of the acquired business and the significant synergies expected to arise 
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes 
acquisition of aesthera corporation on february   we acquired of the common stock of aesthera corporation aesthera  a privately held company for consideration including million in cash and million of shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issued of  was determined based on the volume weighted average closing market price of per share during the five trading days preceding the acquisition date 
in connection with this transaction  we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement which would have required payments ranging from to million in shares of our common stock if certain 
table of contents revenue milestones had been achieved related to the sale of aesthera products and if certain acquired aesthera receivables are collected 
the fair value of the contingent consideration recognized on the acquisition date of million was estimated by applying a probability weighted discounted cash flow approach 
key assumptions include i a discount rate of percent and ii probability of milestone achievement ranging from 
the revenue milestones were not achieved during and accordingly a million gain was recognized in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended december  as a result of the acquisition  we have expanded our product offerings by providing treatment of acne to our customers through our direct sales and distribution network worldwide 
our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of aesthera from the date of acquisition through december  of the total original purchase price of million  million was allocated to amortizable intangible assets  which are being amortized using a straight line method over their respective estimated useful lives of five to six years

significant business trends we derive revenue primarily from the sale of systems  treatment tips and consumables 
for the years ended december   and we derived  and respectively  of our revenue from treatment tips and consumable sales  and  and respectively  of our revenue from system sales 
the balance of our revenue is derived from service  research and development and shipping 
we market our products in north america to physicians  primarily dermatologists and plastic surgeons  through a direct sales force and internationally through a network of independent distributors and our direct sales force in certain countries 
in the years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our revenue from sales of our products and services within north america  and  and  respectively  of our total sales outside of north america 
we believe that a significant portion of our business will continue to come from international sales through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell our products  combined with expansion into new international markets 
the percentages of our revenue by region are presented in the table below years ended december  north america asia pacific europe middle east rest of the world total net revenue 
table of contents future operating results are difficult to predict accurately 
we anticipate that our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including prevailing economic conditions and our customers access to credit  the timing of introduction and the degree of acceptance of future product offerings  unexpected interruptions and expenses related to our manufacturing operations  and the performance of our direct sales force and international distributors 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize disruption in customers ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories  and ensure that enough supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
significant industry factors the success of our business is subject to the impact of economic conditions on the growth of the industry and to our ability to continue to develop new products  applications and innovative technologies  obtain and maintain regulatory clearances for our products  protect our proprietary technology  and successfully market and distribute our products 
our industry is characterized by seasonally lower demand during the third calendar quarter of the year  when both physicians and prospective patients take summer vacations 
additionally  our industry is highly competitive and our success depends on our ability to compete successfully 
our business is sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including political and economic conditions such as recessionary environments  the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
declines in consumer spending on aesthetic procedures could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that impact our business is provided in the risk factors section in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those described below 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred when title and risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and remaining obligations are considered perfunctory 
for most of our product sales  transfer of title and risks and rewards of ownership occurs when the product is shipped 
revenue is recorded net of customer and distributor discounts and rebates 
for sales transactions in which collectability is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon receipt of cash payment 
we sell to end users in the united states and to distributors and end users outside of the united states 
sales to end users and distributors on all products except for the claro product do not include return rights 
for the claro product  we estimate a returns reserve  we typically recognize revenue upon shipment for sales through 
table of contents independent  third party distributors as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment  other than replacement parts 
the distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty services for our products  as well as obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals outside of the united states 
while the regulatory approval process varies greatly by country and we may assist the distributor in the regulatory approval process  the responsibility belongs mainly to the distributor 
we determine whether our remaining obligation in the sale is perfunctory prior to recording revenue 
we do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange products and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of whether the distributor is able to resell the product 
we also offer customers extended warranty service contracts 
revenue from the sale of extended service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable extended contract 
we also earn service revenue from customers outside of their warranty term or extended service contracts 
such service revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
in conjunction with the reliant acquisition  we assumed an agreement with an external party to collaborate on a joint development and the worldwide commercialization of devices and accessories that incorporate fraxel technology 
under the terms of this arrangement  the external party made advance quarterly payments for the costs incurred in performing activities under the arrangement 
as of december   all payments were received by us on this agreement 
revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  which amends accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
asu amended the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
asu permits prospective or retrospective adoption  and we elected prospective adoption during the first quarter of the adoption of asu did not have a significant effect on our revenue in the period of adoption 
our products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asu we evaluate each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
a deliverable is considered a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item  the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
in arrangements where the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered item s and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 
our multi element arrangements generally consist of the sale of systems and post sale obligations like training or installation 
these obligations are fulfilled after product shipment 
for multi element arrangements like these  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices since the deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting 
in such circumstances  asu establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and if there is a price that is actually charged by us for that deliverable 
besp reflects our best estimate of what the selling price of that element would be if it was sold regularly on a stand alone basis  considering factors relevant to our pricing practices such as standalone sales prices of similar products  customer type  and geography 
amounts allocated to the deliverables are recognized as revenue upon delivery  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate appropriate allowances based upon any specific customer collection issues  our history of losses  economic conditions and age of customer balances 
our assessment of the ability of our customers to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  a review of their financial status  as well as consideration of their payment history with us 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we offer a one year warranty for systems sold in the united states and a one year replacement parts warranty for systems sold to distributors outside of the united states 
we also provide a warranty for our consumable products 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  cost being determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market value being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored on a monthly basis and updated quarterly and as necessary to reflect changes in raw material costs and labor and overhead rates 
inventory reserves are established when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory reserves are charged to cost of revenue and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins 
impairment of goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
our goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis or when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare our enterprise fair value to our enterprise carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying value including goodwill exceeds its fair value  we move on to step if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
to date  our fair value has exceeded our carrying value and thus no goodwill impairment charge has been recorded 
we use a combination of our market capitalization and the discounted cash flow methodology to determine the fair value of our single reporting unit 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based on the present value of the cash flows that our single reporting unit is expected to generate in the future 
key assumptions include projections of future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
for the discount rate  we use a rate which reflects our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 

table of contents step we perform an allocation of the fair value to our identifiable tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and liabilities 
this allows us to derive an implied fair value of goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment change would be recognized for the excess 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired 
the goodwill test is based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 
no goodwill impairment was identified through december  impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
through december   there have been no such impairments 
litigation and claims from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes related to legal matters and claims  including those involving intellectual property protection  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an analysis of historical experience 
in the cases where we believe that a reasonably possible loss exists  we disclose the facts and circumstances of the litigation  including an estimate range  if possible 
all legal expenses  including those related to intellectual property protection  are expensed as they are incurred 
also  we do not record any gain contingencies 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax liabilities  tax credits  benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the allowance for the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
we believe we have provided adequate reserves for uncertain tax positions for anticipated audit adjustments by us federal  state and local  as well as foreign tax authorities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes  interest and penalties may be due 
if events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the accrued liabilities are no longer warranted 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
valuation of stock based awards stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of option awards at the grant date 
table of contents requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock  expected forfeitures and expected dividends 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes option pricing model for option grants incorporates our historical volatility and volatility of similar public entities in the aesthetics market due to a lack of historical information regarding the volatility of our stock price 
when establishing the expected term assumption  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing stock market price on the award date 
the fair value of market stock units at the issuance date was estimated using the monte carlo simulation model which is a probabilistic approach for calculating the fair value of the awards 
the monte carlo simulation is a statistical technique used  in this instance  to simulate future stock prices of the company and the russell microcap index by using assumptions such as  expected volatility of our stock  correlation coefficients  risk free interest rates  and contractual life 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenue 
revenue is derived from the sales of systems  treatment tips and other consumables  and service and other revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was mainly from higher tip revenue and the contributions from the sale of the new clear brilliant products which launched in april  and the liposonix products launched in december  partially offset by a decline in system upgrades  a decrease in system sales excluding clear briliant and liposonix  a decrease in handpiece sales  a decrease in research and development revenue related to a research contract that ended in  and a decrease in service contract amortization 
system sales for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in sales of treatment tips and other consumables was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the same period in cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses 
gross margin was of revenue for the years ended december  and gross margin as a percent of revenue stayed constant year over year  as the favorable impact of a higher mix of tip sales  lower manufacturing spend costs net of absorption  lower product excess and obsolescence costs and favorable standard cost changes during  were offset by an increase in purchase price related adjustments to cost of sales that resulted from the acquisition of liposonix in november  an increase in amortization expense from intangibles acquired in the liposonix and clrs acquisitions  and slightly higher warranty expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related costs in our sales  marketing  clinical training  and customer service departments  customer attended workshops  trade shows  advertising  public relations  marketing sponsorship programs  and marketing materials

litigation settlement 
in may  we reached an agreement with alma that settled patent related claims of the parties against each other 
under this agreement  the parties granted each other a covenant not to sue under the patents in the suit and related patents 
we received a one time payment of million and incurred external legal expenses of  for the year ended december  this resulted in a net litigation settlement gain of million for the year ended december  interest income 
interest income consists primarily of interest income generated from our cash and cash equivalents 
interest income increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the same period in the increase is primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances during the first three quarters of interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest expense resulting from borrowings on the line of credit and term loans

there was an income tax benefit of million and a tax provision of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represents a release of valuation allowance of million to offset deferred tax liabilities generated from acquiring liposonix and was reduced by state tax liabilities  foreign tax liabilities  and tax reserves for uncertain tax positions 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented additions to alternative minimum taxes and additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
years ended december  and december  net revenue 
net revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was 
table of contents primarily due to the contributions from the sales of isolaz products and services of million  an increase in tips and consumable sales and an increase in system sales and system upgrades  partially offset by a decline in other revenue and handpiece sales

the provision for income taxes for year ended december  primarily represented additions to amt taxes and additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  primarily represented refunds of income taxes  partially offset by additions to reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we did not recognize any tax benefits in relation to the loss before income taxes for the year ended december  as we maintained a full valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
stock based compensation for the years ended december   and  employee and non employee stock based compensation expense were allocated as follows in thousands years ended december  cost of revenue sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense at december   the total compensation cost related to stock based awards granted or modified to employees and directors but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures 
we will amortize this cost on a straight line basis over the remaining weighted average period of approximately years 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to non employees is recognized on a straight line basis 
the options generally vest ratably over four years 
the values attributable to these options are amortized over the service period and the unvested portion of these options is remeasured as the services are provided and the options are earned 
the stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the deemed fair value of the common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to non employees  we recorded stock based compensation expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents reconciliation of gaap to non gaap financial measures the following presentation includes non gaap measures 
our non gaap measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable gaap measures 
we believe that non gaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the our results of operation as determined in accordance with gaap and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the non gaap financial measures presented are non gaap gross margin  non gaap gross margin as a of sales  non gaap operating income  non gaap ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share 
these non gaap financial measures  as defined by us  are adjusted to exclude one or more of the following items in process research and development  amortization of acquired intangibles and other non cash acquisition related charges  severance expense  acquisition related expenses  loss on investments and stock based compensation expense 
we use non gaap financial measures as performance measures to supplement the financial information we present on a gaap basis 
we believe these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors and management for the reasons stated below 
non gaap gross margin and non gaap gross margin as a of sales provide useful information to investors regarding our gross margin by excluding from cost of sales non cash items like amortization of acquisition related intangibles and stock based compensation expenses 
these costs are generally fixed at the time of acquisition or when the stock based award is granted  are then expensed or amortized over several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after acquisition or once granted 
we further believe that excluding these charges can provide useful information to investors for the reasons stated in the footnotes to these respective items in the presentation that follows 
non gaap operating income reflects our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period to period comparison and analysis of trends in our business  as it excludes expenses that may not be regarded as reflective of ongoing operating results like severance expenses and acquisition related in process research and development expenses  as well as those discussed in non gaap gross margin above 
we further believe that excluding the identified expenses can provide useful information to investors for the reasons stated in the footnotes to these respective items in the presentation that follows 
non gaap ebitda enables investors to assess our compliance with financial covenants under its debt instruments 
our credit facility loans have financial covenants that use non gaap ebitda as part of the measure 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per share  by excluding non cash and one time expenses like those discussed in non gaap gross margin and non gaap operating income measures above  provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our financial results and future prospects in the same manner as management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods 

table of contents for a detailed explanation of the adjustments made to comparable gaap measures and the reasons why management uses these adjustments  see items below 
years ended december  in thousands of dollars  except share and per share data gaap gross margin gaap gross margin as of sales non gaap adjustments to gross margin gaap gross margin amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges stock based compensation non gaap gross margin non gaap gross margin as of sales gaap loss from operations non gaap adjustments to net loss from operations amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges severance expenses acquisition related expenses stock based compensation non gaap income loss from operations depreciation expenses non gaap ebitda gaap net loss non gaap adjustments to net loss amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges severance expenses acquisition related expenses stock based compensation acquisition related income tax benefit non gaap net income loss gaap basic net loss per share non gaap adjustments to basic loss per share amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges severance expenses acquisition related expenses stock based compensation acquisition related income tax benefit non gaap basic net income loss per share non gaap diluted net income loss per share gaap weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating basic net loss per share gaap weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating diluted net loss per share adjustments for dilutive potential common stock weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating non gaap diluted net income loss per share amortization and other non cash acquisition related charges are non cash charges  such as amortization of acquired intangibles  that can be impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions 
we consider our operating results without these charges when evaluating our ongoing performance and or predicting our earnings 
table of contents trends  and therefore exclude such charges when presenting non gaap financial measures 
we believe the assessment of our operations excluding these costs is relevant to our assessment of internal operations and comparisons to the performance of other companies in our industry 
severance expenses include acquisition related severance expenses and are disregarded by our management when evaluating and predicting earnings trends because these charges are unique to specific acquisitions  and are therefore excluded by us when presenting non gaap financial measures 
acquisition related costs include direct costs of the acquisition and expenses related to acquisition integration activities 
examples of costs directly related to an acquisition include transaction fees  due diligence costs and certain legal costs related to acquired litigation which are included in general and administrative expenses in our statement of operations 
these expenses vary significantly in size and amount and are disregarded by our management when evaluating and predicting earnings trends because these charges are unique to specific acquisitions  and are therefore excluded by us when presenting non gaap financial measures 
stock based compensation expense consist of expense relating to stock based awards issued to employees  outside directors and non employees including stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock units with performance based vesting and our employee stock purchase plan 
because of varying available valuation methodologies  subjective assumptions and the variety of award types  we believe that the exclusion of stock based compensation expense allows for more accurate comparisons of our operating results to our peer companies  and for a more accurate comparison of our financial results to previous periods 
in addition  we believe it is useful to investors to understand the specific impact of stock based compensation expenses on our operating results 
depreciation expense includes depreciation and amortization of leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  machinery and equipment  software and computers and equipment 
our management excludes this charge from operating income loss to compute non gaap earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
acquisition related income tax benefit primarily relates to the one time release of valuation allowance to offset deferred tax liabilities generated from acquiring liposonix 
this income tax benefit is disregarded by our management when evaluating and predicting earnings trends because this benefit is unique to a specific acquisition  and are therefore excluded by us when presenting non gaap financial measures 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we had working capital of million  which included million of cash and cash equivalents 
in  we substantially increased our outstanding indebtedness  and reduced our available cash balances  with our acquisition of liposonix  and we may be required to make substantial future cash payments in respect of that transaction 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement the loan agreement with silicon valley bank for a million secured revolving loan facility and a million secured term loan 
we drew down million on the revolving loan facility and million as a term loan in march  and repaid the revolving loan in full in april on june   we entered into an amendment to the loan agreement which provides for an increase of the secured revolving loan facility to million and an additional million secured term loan 
in january  we entered into securities purchase agreements in connection with a private placement of our securities to certain institutional and other accredited investors pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue i an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock  and ii warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the sale of securities resulted in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds  after deducting offering expenses were approximately million 
on march   we entered into a third amendment to the loan agreement which provides for an increase of the commitment under the loan facility by adding a million secured term loan facility  amended certain financial covenants and extended the term of the existing revolving loan facility 
on october   we entered into a fourth amendment to the loan agreement  which authorized us to consummate the acquisition of clrs on october  
table of contents on april   we entered into a fifth amendment to the loan agreement  which extended the borrowing period for term loans borrowed under the secured term loan facility from march  to march   and extended the maturity date of such borrowings for term loans borrowed under the secured term loan facility from december  to december  on september   we entered into a sixth amendment to the loan agreement  which authorized us to enter into a material definitive agreement with medicis to acquire one of its subsidiaries  liposonix 
on october   we entered into a seventh amendment to our loan agreement 
the seventh amendment provides for  among other things  i an increase of the secured term loan facility from million to million  ii amendments to the financial covenants  including changes to the liquidity ratio  the fixed charge coverage ratio and the leverage ratio  iii an extension of the draw period for term loans borrowed under the secured term loan facility from march  to june  and an extension to the maturity date of such borrowings from december  to september   iv an amendment of the interest rate per annum on such borrowings from the greater of a or b the three year us treasury note yield rate on the funding date plus to and v an amendment to the final payment fee on such borrowings from to 
other terms of the loan and security agreement remain unchanged 
also  in connection with the seventh amendment  the company issued warrants to silicon valley bank to purchase  and  shares of common stock  with an exercise price of and per share  respectively 
the warrants are exercisable immediately after issuance and expire in years 
on october   we drew down million on the million secured term loan facility to help fund the upfront payment of million to medicis 
the million upfront payment was made on november   upon the close of the liposonix acquisition 
on november   we drew down the remaining million on the million secured term loan facility to help fund the one time payment of million with respect to the clearance from the fda on the second generation liposonix product received on october  the million one time payment was paid to medicis on november  as of december   the loan agreement contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum liquidity  a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with these covenants as of december  at december  million was outstanding on the revolving loan facility and million was outstanding on the secured term loans 
we repaid all funds drawn from the revolving loan facility in january in connection with the loan and security agreement  our subsidiary  reliant technologies  llc reliant llc  entered into an unconditional guaranty  dated as of march  the guaranty  in favor of lender  pursuant to which reliant llc guaranteed all of our obligations under the loan agreement  and a security agreement  dated as of march   with lender  pursuant to which reliant llc granted a security interest in substantially all of its personal property to collateralize its obligations under the guaranty 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our current and future products  the resources we devote to developing new products and supporting existing products  the required ramp up of inventory for new products  including in  the liposonix system  and contingent payments owed to medics from the liposonix acquisition based on achievement against specified revenue and profit targets 
we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in manufacturing  infrastructure and personnel 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest to address new markets 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from operations  along with our existing credit facilities  will meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our future liquidity requirements may increase beyond currently expected levels if we fail to maintain compliance with covenants in our bank loan agreements or if unanticipated expenses or other uses of our cash arise 
we have consummated acquisitions of other businesses in the past and 
table of contents continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
if we elect to complete additional acquisitions in the future our cash needs are likely to exceed beyond the amount of cash we currently expect to have to fund our operations 
in order to meet our future liquidity needs or to fund acquisitions  we may seek additional equity and or debt financing 
such additional financing may not be available on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  or at all  particularly in the short term due to the current credit and equity market funding environments 
any future equity financing would result in dilution to our stockholders 
the availability of financing or merger opportunities will depend  in part  on market conditions  and the outlook for our company

in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
the updated guidance permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value before applying the two step goodwill impairment model that is currently in place 
if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value  the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary 
the qualitative assessment is optional  allowing companies to go directly to the quantitative assessment 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in annual reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the revised guidance to impact its results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk currently  most of our sales and purchases are denominated in us dollars though the amount of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses has been growing due to the expansion of our direct sales to end users in foreign countries 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products as well as cause variability in our revenue  expenses  interest and other income expense 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates will impact our interest sensitive credit agreement and accordingly may impact interest expense 
we have determined that if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by basis points  there would be no material impact to interest expense over a one year period
